C . B ., D . C . L ., LL . D .\r\nPRINCIPAL LIBRARIAN OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM\r\nDEAR SIR EDWARD,\r\nWith great pleasure I avail myself of the opportunity of inscribing your name at the head of this\r\nwork on the Theban Recension of the Book of the\r\nDead, for you have taken no ordinary interest in its\r\ninception, and progress, and completion . I do it the\r\nmore gladly because I know that everything which\r\nconcerns the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians\r\nand the wonderful doctrine of the resurrection of the\r\nspiritual body and of its everlasting existence, which\r\nthey evolved thousands of years before our era, has\r\nthe greatest attraction for you . It is now many years\r\nago since your friendship with our common friend the\r\nlate Prof. W. Wright began, and your helpful sympathy with his various Oriental works was never wanting ; the like friendship and the like sympathy you\r\nhave extended to myself his pupil . For both I thank\r\nyou, and I subscribe myself,\r\nGratefully yours,\r\nE . A. WALLIS BUDGE.\r\nLONDON, July 27th, X897 .\r\nPREFACE.\r\nThe present volume forms part of a work on the\r\nTheban Recension of the Book of the Dead, which I\r\nhave prepared for Messrs . Kegan Paul and Co . with\r\na view of supplying an edition of the Egyptian text\r\nin hieroglyphic, a full Vocabulary to the same with\r\ncopious references, and a complete translation, with\r\nintroductory chapters upon the history, object and\r\ncontents of the Book of the Dead, in a handy form\r\nand at a moderate price . It is the most complete edition of the Theban Recension hitherto published, but\r\nfuture discoveries in Egypt may at any moment result in the recovery of papyri containing Chapters at\r\npresent unknown to us .\r\nThe texts of the Heliopolitan Recension of the Book\r\nof the Dead of the fifth and sixth dynasties, which are\r\ninscribed upon the Pyramids of Unas, Teta, Pepi I .,\r\nMer-en-Rd, and Pepi II, and which may be regarded as\r\nthe most ancient form of the work now known to us,\r\nhave been published, together with French translations\r\nVIII PREFACE.\r\nof them, by M. Maspero in the various volumes of\r\nRecueil de Travaux, and separately under the title\r\nof Les Inscriptions des Pyramides de Saggarah, Paris,\r\n1894 . The texts of the Recension in use during the\r\neleventh and twelfth dynasties, which are found inscribed upon the coffins of the period, have been\r\npublished by Lepsius and Maspero, and an excellent\r\nidea of their contents may be gained from Birch's translation of the text on the coffin of Amamu, published\r\nwith a complete facsimile by the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum under the title Egyptian Texts of the earliest\r\nperiod from the coffin of Amamu, London, 1886 . The\r\ntexts of the Theban Recension, which was in use from\r\nthe eighteenth to the twenty-second dynasty, i . e ., from\r\nabout B . C. i 6oo to B . C. goo, and which is found inscribed on several papyri, both plain and illuminated,\r\nhave been published by Birch, Mariette, Leemans, Deveria and others, and an eclectic edition of the Recension in use from the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasty\r\nwas published with variants and Einleitung by M. Naville in 1886 . Translations of single papyri belonging\r\nto this period have been published by Deveria and\r\nPierret, Guieyesse, Lefebure, Massey, Pleyte, and\r\nothers, and certain Chapters of this Recension have\r\nbeen translated and discussed by various Egyptologists . Texts, both hieratic and hieroglyphic, which\r\nPREFACE,.\r\n\r\nIX\r\nwere copied and illustrated for the priests and priestesses of Amen during the twenty-first and twentysecond dynasties, have been published by Birch, Leemans, Lepsius, Mariette, and Maspero, and a fine\r\nexample of the hieratic MS . of the period following,\r\nentitled Rituel Funcsraire, was published by E . de Rouge'\r\nin 1861 . Of the texts which represent the Saite\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead, several MSS.\r\nhave been printed and described . The most important\r\nof these, however, is the famous papyrus preserved\r\nat Turin, of which Lepsius published a good copy as\r\nfar back as 1842 entitled Das Todtenbuch der Aegypter.\r\nThe Book of the Dead which was in use throughout the Graeco-Roman and Roman periods is well\r\nillustrated by the hieratic texts published and translated by Birch in the Proceedings of the Society of\r\nBiblical Archaeology, vol. VII, p. 49 ff., and by Lieblein in his Le Livre Egyptien Que moll 110M elfri'sse,\r\nLeipzig, 1895 .\r\nThe first to publish a complete translation of any\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead was Birch, who\r\nin 1867 gave an English version of the Turin papyrus\r\nin the fifth volume of Bunsen, Egypt's Place in Universal History, pp . 123-333 . Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the Recension here translated is the Saite or\r\nlatest of all, and that the text of the Turin MS . is\r\nX\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\nfaulty in many places, Birch's rendering gave a new\CHAPTER I.\r\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\r\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201Cand what is the use of a book,\u201D thought Alice \u201Cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201D\r\n\r\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201COh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201D (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n\r\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201CORANGE MARMALADE\u201D, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell!\u201D thought Alice to herself, \u201Cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201D (Which was very likely true.)\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \u201CI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201D she said aloud. \u201CI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201D (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201C\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201D (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\r\n\r\nPresently she began again. \u201CI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201D (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201C\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201D (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201CAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201D\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201CDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201D (Dinah was the cat.) \u201CI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201D And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201CDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201D and sometimes, \u201CDo bats eat cats?\u201D for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201CNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201D when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201COh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201D She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\r\n\r\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201Cand even if my head would go through,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201D For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201Cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201D said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201CDRINK ME,\u201D beautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say \u201CDrink me,\u201D but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \u201CNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201D she said, \u201Cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201D; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bottle was not marked \u201Cpoison,\u201D so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\u201CWhat a curious feeling!\u201D said Alice; \u201CI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201Cfor it might end, you know,\u201D said Alice to herself, \u201Cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201D And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201D said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201CI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201D She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201CBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\u201D\r\n\r\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201CEAT ME\u201D were beautifully marked in currants. \u201CWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201CWhich way? Which way?\u201D, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\r\n\r\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThe Pool of Tears\r\n\u201CCuriouser and curiouser!\u201D cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201Cnow I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u201D (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201COh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure I shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201CThey must go by the carrier,\u201D she thought; \u201Cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\r\n\r\n     Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.,\r\n       Hearthrug,\r\n         near the Fender,\r\n           (with Alice\u2019s love).\r\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201D\r\n\r\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201D said Alice, \u201Ca great girl like you,\u201D (she might well say this), \u201Cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201D But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201COh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201D Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201CIf you please, sir\u2014\u201D The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201CDear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201D And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201D she said, \u201Cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she\u2019s she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2014no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little\u2014\u2019\u201D and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CHow doth the little crocodile\r\n    Improve his shining tail,\r\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\r\n    On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n\u201CHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n    How neatly spread his claws,\r\nAnd welcome little fishes in\r\n    With gently smiling jaws!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201D said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201CI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201D cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201CI do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201CHow can I have done that?\u201D she thought. \u201CI must be growing small again.\u201D She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was a narrow escape!\u201D said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201Cand now for the garden!\u201D and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201Cand things are worse than ever,\u201D thought the poor child, \u201Cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201Cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201D she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201D said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201CI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould it be of any use, now,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201D So she began: \u201CO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201D (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201CA mouse\u2014of a mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201D) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201D thought Alice; \u201CI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201D (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201CO\u00F9 est ma chatte?\u201D which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201COh, I beg your pardon!\u201D cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201CI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot like cats!\u201D cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201CWould you like cats if you were me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, perhaps not,\u201D said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201Cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201D Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201Cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201D cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201CWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe indeed!\u201D cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201CAs if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t indeed!\u201D said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201CAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201D The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201CThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\u201D cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201CI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201D For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\nSo she called softly after it, \u201CMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201D When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201CLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201CI am older than you, and must know better;\u201D and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\r\n\r\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201CSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201D They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n\u201CAhem!\u201D said the Mouse with an important air, \u201Care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2014\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CUgh!\u201D said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon!\u201D said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201CDid you speak?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot I!\u201D said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought you did,\u201D said the Mouse. \u201C\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFound what?\u201D said the Duck.\r\n\r\n\u201CFound it,\u201D the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201Cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201D said the Duck: \u201Cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201C\u2018\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201D it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs wet as ever,\u201D said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201Cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn that case,\u201D said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201CI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSpeak English!\u201D said the Eaglet. \u201CI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201D And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat I was going to say,\u201D said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201Cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201D said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,\u201D said the Dodo, \u201Cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201D (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\u201Cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201D it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201COne, two, three, and away,\u201D but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201CThe race is over!\u201D and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201CBut who has won?\u201D\r\n\r\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201CEverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut who is to give the prizes?\u201D quite a chorus of voices asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, she, of course,\u201D said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201CPrizes! Prizes!\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201D said the Mouse.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201CWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201D he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201COnly a thimble,\u201D said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n\u201CHand it over here,\u201D said the Dodo.\r\n\r\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201CWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201D and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cand why it is you hate\u2014C and D,\u201D she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\r\n\r\n\u201CMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201D said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201D said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201Cbut why do you call it sad?\u201D And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014\r\n\r\n         \u201CFury said to a\r\n         mouse, That he\r\n        met in the\r\n       house,\r\n     \u2018Let us\r\n      both go to\r\n       law: I will\r\n        prosecute\r\n         you.\u2014Come,\r\n           I\u2019ll take no\r\n           denial; We\r\n          must have a\r\n        trial: For\r\n      really this\r\n     morning I\u2019ve\r\n    nothing\r\n    to do.\u2019\r\n      Said the\r\n      mouse to the\r\n       cur, \u2018Such\r\n        a trial,\r\n         dear sir,\r\n            With\r\n          no jury\r\n        or judge,\r\n       would be\r\n      wasting\r\n      our\r\n      breath.\u2019\r\n        \u2018I\u2019ll be\r\n        judge, I\u2019ll\r\n         be jury,\u2019\r\n             Said\r\n         cunning\r\n          old Fury:\r\n          \u2018I\u2019ll\r\n          try the\r\n            whole\r\n            cause,\r\n              and\r\n           condemn\r\n           you\r\n          to\r\n           death.\u2019\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are not attending!\u201D said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201CWhat are you thinking of?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI beg your pardon,\u201D said Alice very humbly: \u201Cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had not!\u201D cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201CA knot!\u201D said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201COh, do let me help to undo it!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201D said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201CYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201D pleaded poor Alice. \u201CBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease come back and finish your story!\u201D Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201CYes, please do!\u201D but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201D sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201CAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201D \u201CHold your tongue, Ma!\u201D said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201CYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201D said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201CShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201D said the Lory.\r\n\r\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201CDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201CI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201D and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201CCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201D On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201D she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201CNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201D And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u201CThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201D Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201CWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201D And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe took me for his housemaid,\u201D she said to herself as she ran. \u201CHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201D As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201CW. RABBIT,\u201D engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow queer it seems,\u201D Alice said to herself, \u201Cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201D And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201C\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201D Alice went on, \u201Cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201D\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201CDRINK ME,\u201D but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201CI know something interesting is sure to happen,\u201D she said to herself, \u201Cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201D\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201CThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201D\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201CNow I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u201D\r\n\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201D thought poor Alice, \u201Cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and yet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201D she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201Cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut then,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cshall I never get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but then\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you foolish Alice!\u201D she answered herself. \u201CHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n\u201CMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201D said the voice. \u201CFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201D Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\r\n\r\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201CThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat you won\u2019t!\u201D thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nNext came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201CPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201D And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201CSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDigging for apples, indeed!\u201D said the Rabbit angrily. \u201CHere! Come and help me out of this!\u201D (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n\u201CNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201D (He pronounced it \u201Carrum.\u201D)\r\n\r\n\u201CAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201CSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201D \u201CDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201D and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201CWhat a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u201D thought Alice. \u201CI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201CWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201D (a loud crash)\u2014\u201CNow, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, I shan\u2019t! You do it!\u2014That I won\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201D said Alice to herself. \u201CShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201CThis is Bill,\u201D she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201CThere goes Bill!\u201D then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2014\u201CCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201D then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2014\u201CHold up his head\u2014Brandy now\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201D\r\n\r\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201CThat\u2019s Bill,\u201D thought Alice,) \u201CWell, I hardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo you did, old fellow!\u201D said the others.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must burn the house down!\u201D said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201CIf you do, I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201CI wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201D After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201CA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA barrowful of what?\u201D thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201CI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201D she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201CYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201D which produced another dead silence.\r\n\r\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201CIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201D she thought, \u201Cit\u2019s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201D said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201Cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\r\n\r\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201CPoor little thing!\u201D said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201D said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201CI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\r\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201CI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you mean by that?\u201D said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201CExplain yourself!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t explain myself, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t see,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201D Alice replied very politely, \u201Cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot a bit,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201D said Alice; \u201Call I know is, it would feel very queer to me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou!\u201D said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201CWho are you?\u201D\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201CI think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome back!\u201D the Caterpillar called after her. \u201CI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201D\r\n\r\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\r\n\r\n\u201CKeep your temper,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that all?\u201D said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201CSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201D said Alice; \u201CI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCan\u2019t remember what things?\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201CHow doth the little busy bee,\u201D but it all came different!\u201D Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CRepeat, \u201CYou are old, Father William,\u2019\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are old, Father William,\u201D the young man said,\r\n    \u201CAnd your hair has become very white;\r\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\r\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn my youth,\u201D Father William replied to his son,\r\n    \u201CI feared it might injure the brain;\r\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\r\n    Why, I do it again and again.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are old,\u201D said the youth, \u201Cas I mentioned before,\r\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\r\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\r\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn my youth,\u201D said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\r\n    \u201CI kept all my limbs very supple\r\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\r\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are old,\u201D said the youth, \u201Cand your jaws are too weak\r\n    For anything tougher than suet;\r\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\r\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn my youth,\u201D said his father, \u201CI took to the law,\r\n    And argued each case with my wife;\r\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\r\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are old,\u201D said the youth, \u201Cone would hardly suppose\r\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\r\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\r\n    What made you so awfully clever?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201D\r\n    Said his father; \u201Cdon\u2019t give yourself airs!\r\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\r\n    Be off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is not said right,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot quite right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201D said Alice, timidly; \u201Csome of the words have got altered.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201D said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat size do you want to be?\u201D it asked.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201D Alice hastily replied; \u201Conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you content now?\u201D said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201D said Alice: \u201Cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is a very good height indeed!\u201D said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201D pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u201CI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201D said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\r\n\r\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201COne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne side of what? The other side of what?\u201D thought Alice to herself.\r\n\r\n\u201COf the mushroom,\u201D said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\r\n\r\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd now which is which?\u201D she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\r\n\r\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\u201CCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201D said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat can all that green stuff be?\u201D said Alice. \u201CAnd where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201D She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\r\n\r\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\r\n\r\n\u201CSerpent!\u201D screamed the Pigeon.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not a serpent!\u201D said Alice indignantly. \u201CLet me alone!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSerpent, I say again!\u201D repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201CI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201D the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201Cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201D said the Pigeon; \u201Cbut I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201D said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201D continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201Cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I\u2019m not a serpent, I tell you!\u201D said Alice. \u201CI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell! What are you?\u201D said the Pigeon. \u201CI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201D said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\r\n\r\n\u201CA likely story indeed!\u201D said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201CI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI have tasted eggs, certainly,\u201D said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201Cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t believe it,\u201D said the Pigeon; \u201Cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201CYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt matters a good deal to me,\u201D said Alice hastily; \u201Cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want yours: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, be off, then!\u201D said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u201CCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how is that to be done, I wonder?\u201D As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201CWhoever lives there,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201D So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPig and Pepper\r\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n\r\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u201CFor the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\u201D The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201CFrom the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201D\r\n\r\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\r\n\r\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\r\n\r\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201D said the Footman, \u201Cand that for two reasons. First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201D And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease, then,\u201D said Alice, \u201Chow am I to get in?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201D the Footman went on without attending to her, \u201Cif we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\u201D He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201CBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201D she said to herself; \u201Chis eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\u201D she repeated, aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201CI shall sit here,\u201D the Footman remarked, \u201Ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201D the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow am I to get in?\u201D asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you to get in at all?\u201D said the Footman. \u201CThat\u2019s the first question, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \u201CIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201D she muttered to herself, \u201Cthe way all the creatures argue. It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. \u201CI shall sit here,\u201D he said, \u201Con and off, for days and days.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what am I to do?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnything you like,\u201D said the Footman, and began whistling.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, there\u2019s no use in talking to him,\u201D said Alice desperately: \u201Che\u2019s perfectly idiotic!\u201D And she opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201D Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease would you tell me,\u201D said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u201Cwhy your cat grins like that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201D said the Duchess, \u201Cand that\u2019s why. Pig!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats could grin.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey all can,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201Cand most of \u2019em do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know of any that do,\u201D Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t know much,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201Cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, please mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201D cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. \u201COh, there goes his precious nose!\u201D as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf everybody minded their own business,\u201D the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \u201Cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich would not be an advantage,\u201D said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \u201CJust think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTalking of axes,\u201D said the Duchess, \u201Cchop off her head!\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \u201CTwenty-four hours, I think; or is it twelve? I\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, don\u2019t bother me,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201CI never could abide figures!\u201D And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:\r\n\r\n\u201CSpeak roughly to your little boy,\r\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\r\nHe only does it to annoy,\r\n    Because he knows it teases.\u201D\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\r\n\r\n\u201CWow! wow! wow!\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI speak severely to my boy,\r\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\r\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\r\n    The pepper when he pleases!\u201D\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\n\u201CWow! wow! wow!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201D the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \u201CI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u201D and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\r\n\r\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \u201Cjust like a star-fish,\u201D thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. \u201CIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be murder to leave it behind?\u201D She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u201CDon\u2019t grunt,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \u201CBut perhaps it was only sobbing,\u201D she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\r\n\r\nNo, there were no tears. \u201CIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201D said Alice, seriously, \u201CI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\u201D The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\r\n\r\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201CNow, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\u201D when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\r\n\r\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \u201CIf it had grown up,\u201D she said to herself, \u201Cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u201D And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u201Cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201D when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\r\n\r\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\r\n\r\n\u201CCheshire Puss,\u201D she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u201CCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201D thought Alice, and she went on. \u201CWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201D said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201D said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014so long as I get somewhere,\u201D Alice added as an explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Cif you only walk long enough.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u201CWhat sort of people live about here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn that direction,\u201D the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201Clives a Hatter: and in that direction,\u201D waving the other paw, \u201Clives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201D Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201D said the Cat: \u201Cwe\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you know I\u2019m mad?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must be,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Cor you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u201CAnd how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTo begin with,\u201D said the Cat, \u201Ca dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI suppose so,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then,\u201D the Cat went on, \u201Cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI call it purring, not growling,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CCall it what you like,\u201D said the Cat. \u201CDo you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like it very much,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cbut I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201D said the Cat, and vanished.\r\n\r\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.\r\n\r\n\u201CBy-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u201D said the Cat. \u201CI\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt turned into a pig,\u201D Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\r\n\r\n\u201CI thought it would,\u201D said the Cat, and vanished again.\r\n\r\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u201CI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201D she said to herself; \u201Cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it was in March.\u201D As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you say pig, or fig?\u201D said the Cat.\r\n\r\n\u201CI said pig,\u201D replied Alice; \u201Cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAll right,\u201D said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201D thought Alice; \u201Cbut a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u201CSuppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201D\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA Mad Tea-Party\r\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201CVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201D thought Alice; \u201Conly, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u201CNo room! No room!\u201D they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u201CThere\u2019s plenty of room!\u201D said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\r\n\r\n\u201CHave some wine,\u201D the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\r\n\r\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u201CI don\u2019t see any wine,\u201D she remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere isn\u2019t any,\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u201D said Alice angrily.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t know it was your table,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cit\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYour hair wants cutting,\u201D said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\u201D Alice said with some severity; \u201Cit\u2019s very rude.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, \u201CWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, we shall have some fun now!\u201D thought Alice. \u201CI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\u201D she added aloud.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CExactly so,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you should say what you mean,\u201D the March Hare went on.\r\n\r\n\u201CI do,\u201D Alice hastily replied; \u201Cat least\u2014at least I mean what I say\u2014that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot the same thing a bit!\u201D said the Hatter. \u201CYou might just as well say that \u2018I see what I eat\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou might just as well say,\u201D added the March Hare, \u201Cthat \u2018I like what I get\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I get what I like\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou might just as well say,\u201D added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u201Cthat \u2018I breathe when I sleep\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I sleep when I breathe\u2019!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is the same thing with you,\u201D said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\u2019t much.\r\n\r\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u201CWhat day of the month is it?\u201D he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\r\n\r\nAlice considered a little, and then said \u201CThe fourth.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTwo days wrong!\u201D sighed the Hatter. \u201CI told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u201D he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt was the best butter,\u201D the March Hare meekly replied.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u201D the Hatter grumbled: \u201Cyou shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u201CIt was the best butter, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u201CWhat a funny watch!\u201D she remarked. \u201CIt tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy should it?\u201D muttered the Hatter. \u201CDoes your watch tell you what year it is?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not,\u201D Alice replied very readily: \u201Cbut that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhich is just the case with mine,\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u201CI don\u2019t quite understand you,\u201D she said, as politely as she could.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Dormouse is asleep again,\u201D said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u201COf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHave you guessed the riddle yet?\u201D the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I give it up,\u201D Alice replied: \u201Cwhat\u2019s the answer?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n\u201CNor I,\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice sighed wearily. \u201CI think you might do something better with the time,\u201D she said, \u201Cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you knew Time as well as I do,\u201D said the Hatter, \u201Cyou wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting it. It\u2019s him.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course you don\u2019t!\u201D the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u201CI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps not,\u201D Alice cautiously replied: \u201Cbut I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! that accounts for it,\u201D said the Hatter. \u201CHe won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\u201D\r\n\r\n(\u201CI only wish it was,\u201D the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\r\n\r\n\u201CThat would be grand, certainly,\u201D said Alice thoughtfully: \u201Cbut then\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at first, perhaps,\u201D said the Hatter: \u201Cbut you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that the way you manage?\u201D Alice asked.\r\n\r\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u201CNot I!\u201D he replied. \u201CWe quarrelled last March\u2014just before he went mad, you know\u2014\u201D (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u201C\u2014it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\r\n\r\n\u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\r\nHow I wonder what you\u2019re at!\u2019\r\n\r\nYou know the song, perhaps?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve heard something like it,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt goes on, you know,\u201D the Hatter continued, \u201Cin this way:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u2018Up above the world you fly,\r\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\r\n                    Twinkle, twinkle\u2014\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \u201CTwinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle\u2014\u201D and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u201D said the Hatter, \u201Cwhen the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \u2018He\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his head!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow dreadfully savage!\u201D exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd ever since that,\u201D the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u201Che won\u2019t do a thing I ask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u201D\r\n\r\nA bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head. \u201CIs that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?\u201D she asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, that\u2019s it,\u201D said the Hatter with a sigh: \u201Cit\u2019s always tea-time, and we\u2019ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CExactly so,\u201D said the Hatter: \u201Cas the things get used up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\u201D Alice ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n\u201CSuppose we change the subject,\u201D the March Hare interrupted, yawning. \u201CI\u2019m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know one,\u201D said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen the Dormouse shall!\u201D they both cried. \u201CWake up, Dormouse!\u201D And they pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u201CI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201D he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u201CI heard every word you fellows were saying.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTell us a story!\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, please do!\u201D pleaded Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd be quick about it,\u201D added the Hatter, \u201Cor you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\u201D the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u201Cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did they live on?\u201D said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey lived on treacle,\u201D said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u201D Alice gently remarked; \u201Cthey\u2019d have been ill.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo they were,\u201D said the Dormouse; \u201Cvery ill.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u201CBut why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTake some more tea,\u201D the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u201D Alice replied in an offended tone, \u201Cso I can\u2019t take more.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou mean you can\u2019t take less,\u201D said the Hatter: \u201Cit\u2019s very easy to take more than nothing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNobody asked your opinion,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u201D the Hatter asked triumphantly.\r\n\r\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u201CWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u201CIt was a treacle-well.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201D Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u201CSh! sh!\u201D and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u201CIf you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, please go on!\u201D Alice said very humbly; \u201CI won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be one.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COne, indeed!\u201D said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u201CAnd so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw, you know\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did they draw?\u201D said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\r\n\r\n\u201CTreacle,\u201D said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\r\n\r\n\u201CI want a clean cup,\u201D interrupted the Hatter: \u201Clet\u2019s all move one place on.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\r\n\r\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u201CBut I don\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can draw water out of a water-well,\u201D said the Hatter; \u201Cso I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut they were in the well,\u201D Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course they were,\u201D said the Dormouse; \u201C\u2014well in.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey were learning to draw,\u201D the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \u201Cand they drew all manner of things\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy with an M?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\nAlice was silent.\r\n\r\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \u201C\u2014that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say things are \u201Cmuch of a muchness\u201D\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, now you ask me,\u201D said Alice, very much confused, \u201CI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\r\n\r\n\u201CAt any rate I\u2019ll never go there again!\u201D said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. \u201CIt\u2019s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!\u201D\r\n\r\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. \u201CThat\u2019s very curious!\u201D she thought. \u201CBut everything\u2019s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\u201D And in she went.\r\n\r\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. \u201CNow, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201D she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then\u2014she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nThe Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground\r\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201CLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me like that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201D said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201CSeven jogged my elbow.\u201D\r\n\r\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \u201CThat\u2019s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019d better not talk!\u201D said Five. \u201CI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat for?\u201D said the one who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s none of your business, Two!\u201D said Seven.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, it is his business!\u201D said Five, \u201Cand I\u2019ll tell him\u2014it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\u201D\r\n\r\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u201CWell, of all the unjust things\u2014\u201D when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you tell me,\u201D said Alice, a little timidly, \u201Cwhy you are painting those roses?\u201D\r\n\r\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u201CWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\u201D At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u201CThe Queen! The Queen!\u201D and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\r\n\r\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\r\n\r\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u201Cand besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u201D thought she, \u201Cif people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201D So she stood still where she was, and waited.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u201CWho is this?\u201D She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CIdiot!\u201D said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u201CWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201D said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u201CWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd who are these?\u201D said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow should I know?\u201D said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u201CIt\u2019s no business of mine.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u201COff with her head! Off\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNonsense!\u201D said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.\r\n\r\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u201CConsider, my dear: she is only a child!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u201CTurn them over!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\r\n\r\n\u201CGet up!\u201D said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\r\n\r\n\u201CLeave off that!\u201D screamed the Queen. \u201CYou make me giddy.\u201D And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u201CWhat have you been doing here?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMay it please your Majesty,\u201D said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u201Cwe were trying\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see!\u201D said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u201COff with their heads!\u201D and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u201D said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre their heads off?\u201D shouted the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u201D the soldiers shouted in reply.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s right!\u201D shouted the Queen. \u201CCan you play croquet?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes!\u201D shouted Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome on, then!\u201D roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a very fine day!\u201D said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery,\u201D said Alice: \u201C\u2014where\u2019s the Duchess?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHush! Hush!\u201D said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \u201CShe\u2019s under sentence of execution.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat for?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you say \u2018What a pity!\u2019?\u201D the Rabbit asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201D said Alice: \u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a pity. I said \u2018What for?\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe boxed the Queen\u2019s ears\u2014\u201D the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. \u201COh, hush!\u201D the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. \u201CThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGet to your places!\u201D shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\r\n\r\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u201COff with his head!\u201D or \u201COff with her head!\u201D about once in a minute.\r\n\r\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u201Cand then,\u201D thought she, \u201Cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u201D\r\n\r\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \u201CIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow are you getting on?\u201D said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.\r\n\r\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201CIt\u2019s no use speaking to it,\u201D she thought, \u201Ctill its ears have come, or at least one of them.\u201D In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201D Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u201Cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you like the Queen?\u201D said the Cat in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at all,\u201D said Alice: \u201Cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201D Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u201C\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho are you talking to?\u201D said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201D said Alice: \u201Callow me to introduce it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201D said the King: \u201Chowever, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather not,\u201D the Cat remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201D said the King, \u201Cand don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201D He got behind Alice as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CA cat may look at a king,\u201D said Alice. \u201CI\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, it must be removed,\u201D said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u201CMy dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \u201COff with his head!\u201D she said, without even looking round.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u201D said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.\r\n\r\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\r\n\r\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\r\n\r\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201Cbut it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cas all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u201D So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\r\n\r\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\r\n\r\nThe executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at his time of life.\r\n\r\nThe King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in less than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\r\n\r\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \u201CIt belongs to the Duchess: you\u2019d better ask her about it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CShe\u2019s in prison,\u201D the Queen said to the executioner: \u201Cfetch her here.\u201D And the executioner went off like an arrow.\r\n\r\nThe Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nThe Mock Turtle\u2019s Story\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201D said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s, and they walked off together.\r\n\r\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I\u2019m a Duchess,\u201D she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \u201CI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\u201D she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \u201Cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes them bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\u2019t be so stingy about it, you know\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \u201CYou\u2019re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201D Alice ventured to remark.\r\n\r\n\u201CTut, tut, child!\u201D said the Duchess. \u201CEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only you can find it.\u201D And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as she spoke.\r\n\r\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u201D she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis so,\u201D said the Duchess: \u201Cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, \u2019tis love, \u2019tis love, that makes the world go round!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSomebody said,\u201D Alice whispered, \u201Cthat it\u2019s done by everybody minding their own business!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAh, well! It means much the same thing,\u201D said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u201Cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\u201D Alice thought to herself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u201D the Duchess said after a pause: \u201Cthe reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHe might bite,\u201D Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery true,\u201D said the Duchess: \u201Cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201D Alice remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201CRight, as usual,\u201D said the Duchess: \u201Cwhat a clear way you have of putting things!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a mineral, I think,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course it is,\u201D said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \u201Cthere\u2019s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I know!\u201D exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \u201Cit\u2019s a vegetable. It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI quite agree with you,\u201D said the Duchess; \u201Cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more simply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think I should understand that better,\u201D Alice said very politely, \u201Cif I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u201D the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CPray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u201D said the Duchess. \u201CI make you a present of everything I\u2019ve said as yet.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA cheap sort of present!\u201D thought Alice. \u201CI\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give birthday presents like that!\u201D But she did not venture to say it out loud.\r\n\r\n\u201CThinking again?\u201D the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve a right to think,\u201D said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust about as much right,\u201D said the Duchess, \u201Cas pigs have to fly; and the m\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\nBut here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\n\u201CA fine day, your Majesty!\u201D the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CNow, I give you fair warning,\u201D shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u201Ceither you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s go on with the game,\u201D the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.\r\n\r\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives.\r\n\r\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u201COff with his head!\u201D or \u201COff with her head!\u201D Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.\r\n\r\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u201CHave you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Alice. \u201CI don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u201D said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CI never saw one, or heard of one,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome on, then,\u201D said the Queen, \u201Cand he shall tell you his history,\u201D\r\n\r\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u201CYou are all pardoned.\u201D \u201CCome, that\u2019s a good thing!\u201D she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\r\n\r\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u201CUp, lazy thing!\u201D said the Queen, \u201Cand take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;\u201D and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u201CWhat fun!\u201D said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the fun?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, she,\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CIt\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEverybody says \u2018come on!\u2019 here,\u201D thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u201CI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u201D\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. \u201CWhat is his sorrow?\u201D she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201CIt\u2019s all his fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis here young lady,\u201D said the Gryphon, \u201Cshe wants for to know your history, she do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll tell it her,\u201D said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \u201Csit down, both of you, and don\u2019t speak a word till I\u2019ve finished.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, \u201CI don\u2019t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u201D But she waited patiently.\r\n\r\n\u201COnce,\u201D said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u201CI was a real Turtle.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \u201CHjckrrh!\u201D from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \u201CThank you, sir, for your interesting story,\u201D but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen we were little,\u201D the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \u201Cwe went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u201D Alice asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u201D said the Mock Turtle angrily: \u201Creally you are very dull!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\u201D added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u201CDrive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t be all day about it!\u201D and he went on in these words:\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201D interrupted Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou did,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CHold your tongue!\u201D added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ve been to a day-school, too,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cyou needn\u2019t be so proud as all that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWith extras?\u201D asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cwe learned French and music.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd washing?\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CCertainly not!\u201D said Alice indignantly.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u201D said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. \u201CNow at ours they had at the end of the bill, \u2018French, music, and washing\u2014extra.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u201D said Alice; \u201Cliving at the bottom of the sea.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u201D said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \u201CI only took the regular course.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D inquired Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u201D the Mock Turtle replied; \u201Cand then the different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never heard of \u2018Uglification,\u2019\u201D Alice ventured to say. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \u201CWhat! Never heard of uglifying!\u201D it exclaimed. \u201CYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Alice doubtfully: \u201Cit means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, then,\u201D the Gryphon went on, \u201Cif you don\u2019t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \u201CWhat else had you to learn?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, there was Mystery,\u201D the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \u201C\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling\u2014the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat was that like?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I can\u2019t show it you myself,\u201D the Mock Turtle said: \u201CI\u2019m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHadn\u2019t time,\u201D said the Gryphon: \u201CI went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never went to him,\u201D the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201Che taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSo he did, so he did,\u201D said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201D said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201CTen hours the first day,\u201D said the Mock Turtle: \u201Cnine the next, and so on.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat a curious plan!\u201D exclaimed Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201D the Gryphon remarked: \u201Cbecause they lessen from day to day.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. \u201CThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COf course it was,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201D Alice went on eagerly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201D the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: \u201Ctell her something about the games now.\u201D\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nThe Lobster Quadrille\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \u201CSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201D said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\u201D (\u201CI haven\u2019t,\u201D said Alice)\u2014\u201Cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\u201D (Alice began to say \u201CI once tasted\u2014\u201D but checked herself hastily, and said \u201CNo, never\u201D) \u201C\u2014so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, indeed,\u201D said Alice. \u201CWhat sort of a dance is it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy,\u201D said the Gryphon, \u201Cyou first form into a line along the sea-shore\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTwo lines!\u201D cried the Mock Turtle. \u201CSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\u2019ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat generally takes some time,\u201D interrupted the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014you advance twice\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEach with a lobster as a partner!\u201D cried the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course,\u201D the Mock Turtle said: \u201Cadvance twice, set to partners\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u201D continued the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, you know,\u201D the Mock Turtle went on, \u201Cyou throw the\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe lobsters!\u201D shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014as far out to sea as you can\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSwim after them!\u201D screamed the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CTurn a somersault in the sea!\u201D cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\r\n\r\n\u201CChange lobsters again!\u201D yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CBack to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must be a very pretty dance,\u201D said Alice timidly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you like to see a little of it?\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery much indeed,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u201D said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \u201CWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, you sing,\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CI\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CWill you walk a little faster?\u201D said a whiting to a snail.\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a porpoise close behind us, and he\u2019s treading on my tail.\r\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\r\nThey are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance?\r\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?\r\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be\r\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\u201D\r\nBut the snail replied \u201CToo far, too far!\u201D and gave a look askance\u2014\r\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\r\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\r\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat matters it how far we go?\u201D his scaly friend replied.\r\n\u201CThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\r\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014\r\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\r\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance?\r\nWill you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting dance to watch,\u201D said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: \u201Cand I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, as to the whiting,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, \u201Cthey\u2014you\u2019ve seen them, of course?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Alice, \u201CI\u2019ve often seen them at dinn\u2014\u201D she checked herself hastily.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u201D said the Mock Turtle, \u201Cbut if you\u2019ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI believe so,\u201D Alice replied thoughtfully. \u201CThey have their tails in their mouths\u2014and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u201D said the Mock Turtle: \u201Ccrumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is\u2014\u201D here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.\u2014\u201CTell her about the reason and all that,\u201D he said to the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe reason is,\u201D said the Gryphon, \u201Cthat they would go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThank you,\u201D said Alice, \u201Cit\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CDo you know why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI never thought about it,\u201D said Alice. \u201CWhy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt does the boots and shoes,\u201D the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\r\n\r\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201CDoes the boots and shoes!\u201D she repeated in a wondering tone.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, what are your shoes done with?\u201D said the Gryphon. \u201CI mean, what makes them so shiny?\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \u201CThey\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBoots and shoes under the sea,\u201D the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u201Care done with a whiting. Now you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd what are they made of?\u201D Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\r\n\r\n\u201CSoles and eels, of course,\u201D the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u201Cany shrimp could have told you that.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf I\u2019d been the whiting,\u201D said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u201CI\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back, please: we don\u2019t want you with us!\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey were obliged to have him with them,\u201D the Mock Turtle said: \u201Cno wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWouldn\u2019t it really?\u201D said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course not,\u201D said the Mock Turtle: \u201Cwhy, if a fish came to me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t you mean \u2018purpose\u2019?\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CI mean what I say,\u201D the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u201CCome, let\u2019s hear some of your adventures.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\u201D said Alice a little timidly: \u201Cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CExplain all that,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no! The adventures first,\u201D said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u201Cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\u201D\r\n\r\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \u201CYou are old, Father William,\u201D to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \u201CThat\u2019s very curious.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u201D said the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt all came different!\u201D the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u201CI should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u201D He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CStand up and repeat \u2018\u2019Tis the voice of the sluggard,\u2019\u201D said the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u201D thought Alice; \u201CI might as well be at school at once.\u201D However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\r\n\u201CYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201D\r\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\r\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u201D\r\n\r\n[later editions continued as follows\r\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\r\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\r\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\r\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\u201D said the Gryphon.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I never heard it before,\u201D said the Mock Turtle; \u201Cbut it sounds uncommon nonsense.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.\r\n\r\n\u201CI should like to have it explained,\u201D said the Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\n\u201CShe can\u2019t explain it,\u201D said the Gryphon hastily. \u201CGo on with the next verse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut about his toes?\u201D the Mock Turtle persisted. \u201CHow could he turn them out with his nose, you know?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the first position in dancing.\u201D Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\u201CGo on with the next verse,\u201D the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u201Cit begins \u2018I passed by his garden.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\r\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n[later editions continued as follows\r\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\r\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\r\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\r\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\r\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\r\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201D the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u201Cif you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201D said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.\r\n\r\n\u201CShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201D the Gryphon went on. \u201COr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201D Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u201CHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u2018Turtle Soup,\u2019 will you, old fellow?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,\r\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\r\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\r\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\r\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\r\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\r\nSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\r\n\r\n\u201CBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\r\nGame, or any other dish?\r\nWho would not give all else for two p\r\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\r\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\r\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\r\n    Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop!\r\nSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beauti\u2014FUL SOUP!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CChorus again!\u201D cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of \u201CThe trial\u2019s beginning!\u201D was heard in the distance.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome on!\u201D cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat trial is it?\u201D Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \u201CCome on!\u201D and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening,\r\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\u201D\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nWho Stole the Tarts?\r\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\u201CI wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u201D she thought, \u201Cand hand round the refreshments!\u201D But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.\r\n\r\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. \u201CThat\u2019s the judge,\u201D she said to herself, \u201Cbecause of his great wig.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s the jury-box,\u201D thought Alice, \u201Cand those twelve creatures,\u201D (she was obliged to say \u201Ccreatures,\u201D you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \u201CI suppose they are the jurors.\u201D She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \u201Cjury-men\u201D would have done just as well.\r\n\r\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u201CWhat are they doing?\u201D Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \u201CThey can\u2019t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201D the Gryphon whispered in reply, \u201Cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStupid things!\u201D Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \u201CSilence in the court!\u201D and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.\r\n\r\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \u201Cstupid things!\u201D on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u201Cstupid,\u201D and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \u201CA nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u201D thought Alice.\r\n\r\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\r\n\r\n\u201CHerald, read the accusation!\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\r\n    All on a summer day:\r\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\r\n    And took them quite away!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CConsider your verdict,\u201D the King said to the jury.\r\n\r\n\u201CNot yet, not yet!\u201D the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u201CThere\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCall the first witness,\u201D said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u201CFirst witness!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \u201CI beg pardon, your Majesty,\u201D he began, \u201Cfor bringing these in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou ought to have finished,\u201D said the King. \u201CWhen did you begin?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \u201CFourteenth of March, I think it was,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CFifteenth,\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CSixteenth,\u201D added the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n\u201CWrite that down,\u201D the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake off your hat,\u201D the King said to the Hatter.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t mine,\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n\u201CStolen!\u201D the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.\r\n\r\n\u201CI keep them to sell,\u201D the Hatter added as an explanation; \u201CI\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u201D\r\n\r\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive your evidence,\u201D said the King; \u201Cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.\r\n\r\n\u201CI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u201D said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u201CI can hardly breathe.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t help it,\u201D said Alice very meekly: \u201CI\u2019m growing.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve no right to grow here,\u201D said the Dormouse.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201D said Alice more boldly: \u201Cyou know you\u2019re growing too.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\u201D said the Dormouse: \u201Cnot in that ridiculous fashion.\u201D And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u201CBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u201D on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive your evidence,\u201D the King repeated angrily, \u201Cor I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201D the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u201C\u2014and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe twinkling of the what?\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt began with the tea,\u201D the Hatter replied.\r\n\r\n\u201COf course twinkling begins with a T!\u201D said the King sharply. \u201CDo you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m a poor man,\u201D the Hatter went on, \u201Cand most things twinkled after that\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI didn\u2019t!\u201D the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou did!\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n\u201CI deny it!\u201D said the March Hare.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe denies it,\u201D said the King: \u201Cleave out that part.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\u201D the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\u201CAfter that,\u201D continued the Hatter, \u201CI cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut what did the Dormouse say?\u201D one of the jury asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat I can\u2019t remember,\u201D said the Hatter.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou must remember,\u201D remarked the King, \u201Cor I\u2019ll have you executed.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. \u201CI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201D he began.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re a very poor speaker,\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201D thought Alice. \u201CI\u2019ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201CThere was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\u201D and I never understood what it meant till now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201D continued the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201D said the Hatter: \u201CI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThen you may sit down,\u201D the King replied.\r\n\r\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\r\n\r\n\u201CCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!\u201D thought Alice. \u201CNow we shall get on better.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201D said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may go,\u201D said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2014and just take his head off outside,\u201D the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.\r\n\r\n\u201CCall the next witness!\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\nThe next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive your evidence,\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CShan\u2019t,\u201D said the cook.\r\n\r\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u201CYour Majesty must cross-examine this witness.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, if I must, I must,\u201D the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u201CWhat are tarts made of?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPepper, mostly,\u201D said the cook.\r\n\r\n\u201CTreacle,\u201D said a sleepy voice behind her.\r\n\r\n\u201CCollar that Dormouse,\u201D the Queen shrieked out. \u201CBehead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u201D\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever mind!\u201D said the King, with an air of great relief. \u201CCall the next witness.\u201D And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u201CReally, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u201D\r\n\r\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u201C\u2014for they haven\u2019t got much evidence yet,\u201D she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u201CAlice!\u201D\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nAlice\u2019s Evidence\r\n\u201CHere!\u201D cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I beg your pardon!\u201D she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe trial cannot proceed,\u201D said the King in a very grave voice, \u201Cuntil all the jurymen are back in their proper places\u2014all,\u201D he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\r\n\r\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; \u201Cnot that it signifies much,\u201D she said to herself; \u201CI should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat do you know about this business?\u201D the King said to Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing whatever?\u201D persisted the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CNothing whatever,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s very important,\u201D the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \u201CUnimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\u201D he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CUnimportant, of course, I meant,\u201D the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,\r\n\r\n\u201Cimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\u201D as if he were trying which word sounded best.\r\n\r\nSome of the jury wrote it down \u201Cimportant,\u201D and some \u201Cunimportant.\u201D Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \u201Cbut it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u201D she thought to herself.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out \u201CSilence!\u201D and read out from his book, \u201CRule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.\u201D\r\n\r\nEverybody looked at Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not a mile high,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are,\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CNearly two miles high,\u201D added the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u201D said Alice: \u201Cbesides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen it ought to be Number One,\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \u201CConsider your verdict,\u201D he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u201D said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \u201Cthis paper has just been picked up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s in it?\u201D said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CI haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u201D said the White Rabbit, \u201Cbut it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt must have been that,\u201D said the King, \u201Cunless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWho is it directed to?\u201D said one of the jurymen.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt isn\u2019t directed at all,\u201D said the White Rabbit; \u201Cin fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the outside.\u201D He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u201CIt isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAre they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u201D asked another of the jurymen.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, they\u2019re not,\u201D said the White Rabbit, \u201Cand that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u201D (The jury all looked puzzled.)\r\n\r\n\u201CHe must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u201D said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease your Majesty,\u201D said the Knave, \u201CI didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you didn\u2019t sign it,\u201D said the King, \u201Cthat only makes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat proves his guilt,\u201D said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt proves nothing of the sort!\u201D said Alice. \u201CWhy, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re about!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CRead them,\u201D said the King.\r\n\r\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u201CWhere shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201CBegin at the beginning,\u201D the King said gravely, \u201Cand go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014\r\n\r\n\u201CThey told me you had been to her,\r\n    And mentioned me to him:\r\nShe gave me a good character,\r\n    But said I could not swim.\r\n\r\nHe sent them word I had not gone\r\n    (We know it to be true):\r\nIf she should push the matter on,\r\n    What would become of you?\r\n\r\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\r\n    You gave us three or more;\r\nThey all returned from him to you,\r\n    Though they were mine before.\r\n\r\nIf I or she should chance to be\r\n    Involved in this affair,\r\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\r\n    Exactly as we were.\r\n\r\nMy notion was that you had been\r\n    (Before she had this fit)\r\nAn obstacle that came between\r\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let him know she liked them best,\r\n    For this must ever be\r\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\r\n    Between yourself and me.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u201D said the King, rubbing his hands; \u201Cso now let the jury\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIf any one of them can explain it,\u201D said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \u201CI\u2019ll give him sixpence. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \u201CShe doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it,\u201D but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u201D said the King, \u201Cthat saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any. And yet I don\u2019t know,\u201D he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u201CI seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201C\u2014said I could not swim\u2014\u201D you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u201D he added, turning to the Knave.\r\n\r\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \u201CDo I look like it?\u201D he said. (Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)\r\n\r\n\u201CAll right, so far,\u201D said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u201C\u2018We know it to be true\u2014\u2019 that\u2019s the jury, of course\u2014\u2018I gave her one, they gave him two\u2014\u2019 why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know\u2014\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut, it goes on \u2018they all returned from him to you,\u2019\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy, there they are!\u201D said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \u201CNothing can be clearer than that. Then again\u2014\u2018before she had this fit\u2014\u2019 you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u201D he said to the Queen.\r\n\r\n\u201CNever!\u201D said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)\r\n\r\n\u201CThen the words don\u2019t fit you,\u201D said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a pun!\u201D the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u201CLet the jury consider their verdict,\u201D the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo, no!\u201D said the Queen. \u201CSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStuff and nonsense!\u201D said Alice loudly. \u201CThe idea of having the sentence first!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHold your tongue!\u201D said the Queen, turning purple.\r\n\r\n\u201CI won\u2019t!\u201D said Alice.\r\n\r\n\u201COff with her head!\u201D the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho cares for you?\u201D said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u201CYou\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u201D\r\n\r\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\r\n\r\n\u201CWake up, Alice dear!\u201D said her sister; \u201CWhy, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u201D said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u201CIt was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u201D So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\r\n\r\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\u2014\r\n\r\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.\r\n\r\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.\r\n\r\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs.\r\n\r\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\n\r\nTHE ENDr\nimpulse to the study of the Egyptian religion, and it\r\nhas formed the groundwork of the translations made\r\nby Egyptologists subsequently. The thing to wonder\r\nat is not the mistakes which he made, but that he\r\nwas able, at that early date, to translate so much\r\ncorrectly . In 1882 Pierret published a French translation of the Turin Papyrus entitled Le Livre des Morts\r\ndes anciens J.oyptiens, and in 1894 Davis published an\r\nEnglish version of Pierret's French translation at New\r\nYork. Up to the present, however, no complete translation of the Theban Recension has appeared . Translations of single papyri, e . g ., the Papyrus of Nebseni,\r\nthe Papyrus of Ani, the Papyrus of Sutimes, the Papyrus\r\nof Neb-qed, etc ., have been made by Deveria and\r\nPierret, Guieyesse, Massey, myself, and others ; and\r\na translation of the texts published by Naville in his\r\n7odtenbnch, and by others, was begun by Renouf in\r\nthe Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,\r\nVol. XIV.\r\nSince the appearance of Naville's great work in\r\n1886 several extremely important papyri have been\r\ndiscovered, and it is now possible to add to the texts\r\nof the Theban Recension which he published a considerable number of Chapters, etc . From the Papyrus\r\nof Ani we obtain Introductions to Chapters XVIII and\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXI\r\nCXXV, a hymn to Ra, a hymn to Osiris, texts referring to the judgment Scene, all of which are new ;\r\nbesides these we gain from it a complete, though\r\nshort, version of Chapter CLXXV, and the Vignettes\r\nare coloured with a care and beauty hitherto unknown\r\nin papyri of this class . Of greater interest textually,\r\nhowever, is the Papyrus of Nu, which the Trustees\r\nof the British Museum acquired in i 890 . It is, I believe, the oldest of illuminated papyri known, and it\r\ncertainly was written in the first half of the period of\r\nthe rule of the kings of the eighteenth dynasty ; it is\r\nnearly, if not quite, as old as the famous papyrus of\r\nNebseni . Unlike many of the papyri of that date it\r\nwas written throughout by one man, probably Nu\r\nhimself. As in all papyri lines are omitted here and\r\nthere, and one short Chapter is repeated ; in it, however, are about twenty Chapters of the Theban Recension which have not hitherto been found, and\r\nseveral which have, up to the present, been only\r\nknown to exist in single manuscripts .\r\nFrom the above facts it is clear that an edition of\r\nthe texts of the Theban Recension which should contain all such new Chapters, etc ., was needed. When\r\na few years ago Sir F . Maunde Thompson suggested\r\nto me to make a translation of the Book of the Dead\r\nfor popular use I decided to do so, and to publish\r\nXII PREFACE.\r\nat the same time an edition of the Egyptian texts ;\r\nfor in these days the reader insists, and rightly, upon\r\nthe reproduction of the original documents as far as\r\npossible, so that he may be able to control the renderings set forth by the translator. Since no papyrus\r\ncontains all the Chapters of the Theban Recension,\r\nand no two papyri agree either in respect of contents\r\nor arrangement of the Chapters, and the critical\r\nvalue of every text in a papyrus is not always the\r\nsame, it follows that a complete edition of all the\r\nknown Chapters of the Theban Recension is impossible\r\nunless recourse be had to several papyri . I have\r\ntherefore made use of several, and as a result translations of about 16o Chapters, not including different\r\nversions, hymns and rubrics, are given in the present\r\nvolume ; I have also added translations of 16 Chapters\r\nof the Saite Recension, both because they form good\r\nspecimens of the religious compositions of the later\r\nperiod and illustrate some curious beliefs, and because,\r\nhaving adopted the numbering of the Chapters employed by Lepsius, they were needed to make the\r\nnumbering of the Chapters in this edition consecutive .\r\nMy translation has been made as literal as possible,\r\nmy aim being to let the reader judge for himself the\r\ncontents of the Theban Book of the Dead . As it is\r\nintended for popular use I have not encumbered the\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\npages with voluminous notes, nor have I attempted\r\nto explain the allusions and obscurities which no man,\r\nat present, understands . For references to the works\r\nof other writers the reader is referred to the Bibliography at the end of my Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum, London, 1895, and to the notes in the\r\nIntroduction to that work . The source of each Chapter is set forth clearly above it, together with a description of the Vignette to it as it is found in the\r\nbest papyri of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties . Since the Vignettes formed originally no part of\r\nthe Book of the Dead, no attempt has been made\r\nto reproduce them here ; a collection of all the Vignettes found in the Theban papyri, especially those\r\nwhich are found in the Books of the Dead made for\r\nthe priests of Amen after B . C. iooo, would be of\r\ngreat value, but, unless they were reproduced in their\r\nactual colours, much of their interest would be lost .\r\nThe whole judgment Scene, and the Elysian Fields,\r\nand a portion of the Vignette to the first Chapter\r\nhave, however, been beautifully reproduced in full\r\ncolours by Mr. W. Griggs from the Papyrus of Ani,\r\nand these form excellent examples of the artistic work\r\nexecuted upon papyri in the eighteenth dynasty ; those\r\nwho require other examples are referred to the second\r\nedition of the coloured facsimile of the Papyrus of\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\nAni published by the Trustees of the British Museum\r\nin 1894.\r\nIn the Introduction a sketch of the history of the\r\ngrowth and development of the Book of the Dead\r\nhas been given, and to illustrate the palaeography\r\nof the different Recensions, from about B . C . 3500 to\r\nabout A. D . Zoo, eighteen plates have been appended .\r\nThe remaining brief accounts of some of the religious\r\nviews of the Egyptians are necessary for the understanding of the aim and object of the Book of the\r\nDead ; they would have been fuller had space permitted, and I reserve a more detailed description of\r\nthem for a future work on the Egyptian Religion .\r\nWith the view of shewing how, in the Ptolemaic period\r\nand later times, the Egyptians hoped to obtain for\r\ntheir dead all the benefits which were believed to be\r\nsecured for them by the use of the numerous Chapters of earlier periods, by means of a work which,\r\nthough extremely short, preserved all the essential beliefs of the olden time, a translation has been added\r\nof the \"Book of Breathings\" from the text of the Papyrus of Kerasher (Brit . Mus. No. 9995). By means of\r\nthis and the extracts from the Pyramid Texts given\r\nin my chapter on the Elysian Fields a comparison of\r\nthe beliefs of the Egyptians in the earliest and latest\r\ntimes can be made.\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXV\r\nIn a small volume accompanying the text of the Theban Recension will be found a Vocabulary, containing\r\nover 35,000 references, which has been bound up separately in deference to the wishes of many . In the\r\ncase of uncommon words every example of its use\r\nwhich occurs in the book is noted ; for commoner\r\nwords copious references are given in order that the\r\nreader may the more easily compare their meanings\r\nin several passages.\r\nFinally it is my duty to express my grateful thanks\r\nto the Trustees of the British Museum for permission\r\nto print certain Chapters of the Papyrus of Nebseni\r\nand of the Papyrus of Ani from the publications issued\r\nby them. My thanks are also due to Mr . Holzhausen\r\nof Vienna for the care which he has bestowed upon\r\nthe printing of the three parts of this work, and to\r\nMr . Griggs for the coloured reproductions from the\r\nPapyrus of Ani which he has executed with his usual\r\nskill .\r\nE. A. WALLIS BUDGE.\r\nLONDON, August 19th, 1897 .\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\nI .

The Egyptians embalmed their dead either\r\nbecause they wished to keep their material bodies with\r\nthem upon earth, or because they believed that the\r\nfuture welfare of the departed depended in some way\r\nupon the preservation of the bodies which they had\r\nleft behind them upon earth . Whatever the motive,\r\nit is quite certain that it must have been a very powerful one, for the custom of embalming the dead lasted\r\nin Egypt without a break for at least five thousand\r\nyears . It survived all the influence which the Greeks\r\nXXXVII I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nand Romans brought to bear upon the habits and\r\ncustoms of the Egyptians, and only disappeared from\r\nthe country about two hundred years before its conquest by Muhammad's general `Amr ibn al-`Asi, A. D .\r\n658 . The writings of ancient Egypt shew that it was\r\nnot only the custom, but also the duty of a man to\r\nprepare during his life-time a suitable tomb in which\r\nhis body might rest after death, and it is to the desire\r\nof preserving the body on the part of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich found practical expression in the hewing of\r\ntombs and the making of elaborate funeral furniture,\r\nthat we owe the greater part of our knowledge of their\r\nreligious beliefs . As time went on the embalming of\r\nthe dead was performed in a more elaborate manner,\r\nand at the same time the last resting place of the\r\nmummified body was chosen more carefully and\r\nwrought with greater attention . At a very early period\r\nthe wealthy discarded the use of holes in rocks and\r\ncaves as tombs, for in these the bodies were accessible to the attacks of enemies, and wild animals, and\r\nserpents ; and the same objection was, naturally, made\r\nto shallow hollows made in the limestone and covered\r\nover with slabs of the same material, and also to the\r\nvaulted, crude brick graves which were commonly in\r\nuse in the early dynasties . The place of these was\r\ntaken by pyramids built of stone, and by many-chambered tombs hewn in the living rock . Experience,\r\nhowever, soon shewed the Egyptian that the most\r\ncarefully constructed tomb was incapable of prevent-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XXXIX\r\ning damp-rot or dry-rot and decay, and that some\r\nother power besides his own must be invoked to prevent the destruction of the body, which, though needing longer time to accomplish, was as effectually performed by these means as by the tooth of the wild\r\nanimal or serpent, or by the hand of the enemy . At this\r\nstage the aid of the professional religious man or priest\r\nwas called in, and the task of finding means to prevent rot and decay was entrusted to him . There is J\r\nlittle doubt that when the body was laid to rest in\r\nthe tomb, the priest pronounced certain words or formulae or prayers over it, and it is probable that the\r\nrecital of these words was accompanied by the performance of certain ceremonies . Whatever these formulae were they formed the foundation of the Book\r\nof the Dead of later Egyptian times . It is idle to\r\nattempt to consider what such words were, but we\r\nare within our right if we assume that they were\r\naddressed to the god or gods of the community on\r\nbehalf of the dead, and that they contained petitions\r\nfor the welfare of the departed in the world beyond\r\nthe grave. Such petitions would refer more to material than to spiritual happiness . Indeed it is more\r\nthan doubtful if the Egyptian, at that time, had developed any spiritual conceptions, in our sense of the\r\nword ; for, although his ideas were very definite as to\r\nthe reality of a future existence, I think that he had\r\nformulated few details about it, and that he had no\r\nidea as to where or how it was to be enjoyed .\r\nXL INTRODUCTION.\r\nCertain portions of texts which have been incorporated into religious works of a later period shew\r\nthat the life which the Egyptian hoped to live after\r\ndeath was one similar to that which he led upon\r\nearth, and it is clear that he thought the preservation\r\nof his natural or material body to be, in some way,\r\nabsolutely necessary for the attainment of this life .\r\nHe hoped to have power to exercise all the natural\r\nfunctions of his body, and to be able to journey about\r\nat pleasure ; unless the body and all its members\r\nwere preserved, such a life was impossible for him .\r\nThe earliest monuments in Egypt of the historic period\r\nare tombs, and the universal testimony of these is to\r\nthe effect that the Egyptian endeavoured to attain to\r\nthis life by the embalmment of the body, and by the\r\npower which the texts inscribed upon his tomb, coffin,\r\netc ., could give him . And this was always so, for the\r\nearliest tombs prove that they were hewn out or built\r\naccording to a recognized system which had become\r\nsanctified by antiquity, and that they were intended\r\nto keep intact bodies which had been treated with\r\nbalms and balsams, unguents and drugs, and other\r\nsimilar preservative compounds ; and the texts written\r\nupon them take the fact of the existence of a future\r\nlife for granted, and assume that its duration will be\r\ninfinite . The oldest tombs of this kind to which we\r\ncan assign a date belong to the period of the second\r\ndynasty, about B . C. 4200, but there are some in\r\nexistence which are remarkable for the extremely ar-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nXLI\r\nchaic grouping of the inscriptions upon the walls and\r\nwhich may well belong to a very much earlier time . In\r\nthis connexion the evidence supplied by the curious\r\ntombs which MM. Ame'lineau and J . de Morgan have recently excavated at El -'Amrah, a place situated about\r\nfive miles from Abydos on the west bank of the Nile,\r\nis of peculiar interest . Here were found a number of\r\noval graves, sunk in the stony soil to a depth varying from five to six feet, wherein were the skeletons\r\nof human bodies lying upon their sides ; their hands\r\nwere crossed before their faces, and their knees were\r\nbent and were on a level with their chests . With them\r\nwere buried flints, small bronze implements, pottery\r\nornamented and plain, stone vases, shell ornaments,\r\netc ., and, though experts are divided in their opinion\r\nas the exact antiquity of these objects, there seems\r\nlittle doubt that the oldest of them belong to the\r\nperiod of the dawn of Egyptian civilization, and that\r\nis sufficient for our purpose at present . A number of\r\nthe skeletons from the tombs of El ' Amrah were submitted for examination to Dr . Fouquet of Cairo, who\r\nhas found reason for declaring that they shew traces of\r\nthe bodies to which they belonged having been treated with compounds or substances used in embalming\r\nthe dead . This fact sheers that the friends and relatives of the departed who caused their bodies to be\r\nso treated must have considered that it would be of\r\nsome benefit to them in their life in the world beyond\r\nthe grave, and in so doing they were, probably, only\r\nX LI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nconforming to a custom which was already old and\r\nwell established in their day . It must not he forgotten\r\nthat the skeletons in the cemetery of El-`Amrah were\r\nfound lying on their sides, and this fact strongly supports the view that the tombs are not tombs of Egyptians but of their immediate predecessors or of contemporaries of the early dynasties . In no Egyptian tomb\r\nhitherto opened has the mummy been deposited on\r\nits side ; moreover, the Egyptian mummy is always\r\nfound lying upon its back, its arms are always laid\r\non the body, and the hands rest on the tops of the\r\nthighs . Though the burials at El-Amrah tell us nothing\r\nabout the ceremonies, religious or otherwise, which\r\nwere performed over the departed when they were\r\ncommitted to the earth, they prove almost beyond a\r\ndoubt that peoples other than the Egyptians partially\r\nembalmed their dead at that remote period, and this\r\nbeing so it is probable that the religious ideas and\r\nthe belief in a future life which the Egyptians possessed were shared by the nations round about them,\r\nwith whom they were perhaps connected by ties of\r\nblood.\r\nPassing from prehistoric times of which we know\r\nlittle, and that little imperfectly, we come to the tombs\r\nof the first four dynasties, which chew that a great\r\ndevelopment in the religious ideas and funeral ceremonies has taken place since the first of the graves\r\nat El-`Amrah was dug . We see that certain symbolic\r\nceremonies were regularly performed, that a number\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLIII\r\nof priestly officials, with clearly defined duties in connexion with funerals, had come into being, that a\r\nlarge number of festivals were celebrated at or near\r\nthe tomb throughout the year, that the offering of\r\nmeat and drink, of unguents and garments, and of\r\ngreen herbs and flowers at stated times had grown\r\ninto a system, that a number of gods were duly\r\nhonoured and worshipped, that the priests of the\r\ngods belonged to and probably formed the ruling\r\nclass of the districts in which they lived, that certain\r\ngods had already obtained the position of national\r\ndeities who were known and honoured throughout\r\nthe country, and that certain cities, such as Abydos,\r\nAnnu (On), and Memphis, had become centres of teaching of the views and dogmas which their respective\r\npriests had adopted and modified, or had themselves\r\nevolved. It is quite certain that certain priestly officials lived and died, for the texts on their tombs\r\nbear witness to this fact ; if the official lived, then\r\nthe office to which he was appointed existed ; and\r\nif religious books, the reading of which during the\r\nfuneral was necessary for the welfare of the departed,\r\nhad not existed, men would not have been appointed\r\nto read them . At this time we find that certain priests\r\ncalled \"priests of the ka\" were duly appointed, and\r\nthat they performed their ministrations in \"chapels\r\nof the ka\" which were attached to the tombs of kings\r\nand wealthy men ; this chews beyond a doubt that\r\nthe doctrine of the existence of a \"double\" of a man\r\nLIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nlad been evolved, and the making of offerings to it\r\nat stated intervals at the tomb proves that it was\r\nbelieved to dwell therein, and that material meat and\r\ndrink were necessary for its well-being. This is important also as indicating that the offerings were not\r\nconsumed by the deceased himself, however needful\r\nthe ceremony of offering them might be for his general welfare . Similarly, the sufferings, death, and resurrection of Osiris were well known in the period\r\nof the early dynasties, and it is probable that he\r\nbecame the type of the resurrection of man in Egypt,\r\nlong before the religious texts which assume it and\r\nwhich call him the god and king and judge of the\r\ndead passed from oral tradition to inscribed papyrus .\r\nA study of the religious texts of all periods proves\r\nthat the great fundamental religious ideas of the Egyptians remained unchanged from the earliest to the latest historical times, and it seems that they must have\r\nbeen received by the early Egyptian priests in much\r\nthe same form as that in which they handed them\r\non . The doctrine of immortality and everlasting life\r\nand the belief in the resurrection of a spiritual body\r\nare the brightest and most prominent features of the\r\nEgyptian religion ; they survived all the theological\r\ntheories and speculations of the various schools of\r\nreligious thought in Egypt, and to them generations\r\nof men clung with a firmness and tenacity marvellous\r\nto consider. And side by side with these beliefs there\r\nflourished the religious texts to which the name BOOK\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLV\r\nOF THE DEAD has been given, and they appealed mightily to all, from highest to lowest, for they were believed to give man power in the world beyond the\r\ngrave, and to enable him to attain to the abode of\r\nthe blessed and to gain everlasting life .\r\nNo amount of research and no discovery have, as\r\nyet, yielded any information about the home, and\r\norigin, and early history of the Book of the Dead .\r\nIt seems pretty clear that, as said above, the first\r\nform of all of the Book of the Dead consisted of the\r\nwords or petitions addressed to the \"god of the city\",\r\nor to a collection of supernatural powers, on behalf\r\nof the deceased by relatives and friends, and that\r\nsuch petitions referred to material rather than to spiritual things . That they would increase in number and\r\nin length as time went on is only what is to be expected, and the nature of their contents also would\r\nvary according to the rank and position of the deceased . At first they were recited only and not written\r\ndown, and it is probable that they existed in this form\r\nfor a very long period ; at length they were done into writing, but this, I believe, only took place when\r\nthe professional religious men or priests began to be\r\ndoubtful about the meaning of some of them, and uncertain about the way in which they should be written . The priests wrote them down to preserve them,\r\nand thus endeavoured to keep without further corruption texts which already in their day had become\r\nexceedingly old and difficult of understanding . The\r\nX LV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nwriting materials which they employed for this purpose are unknown . It is hardly possible that they inscribed their texts upon stone, for had they done so\r\nremains of such inscriptions would certainly have been\r\nfound ere this . In Egypt, at all events, the commonest\r\nwriting material was the papyrus, and, the hieroglyphic for \"book\" or \"writing\" being in the earliest\r\ntimes a roll of papyrus tied round the middle with a\r\nstring of the same material, it is probable that religious texts were first written upon papyrus rolls . The\r\nsyllabary, or alphabet, or both, employed by these\r\nearly scribes would probably be hieroglyphic or pictorial, but no specimen of it has come down to us ;\r\nit is not likely that the signs used for writing the texts\r\nwould be wholly alphabetic or wholly syllabic, for in\r\nthe earliest inscriptions known to us both kinds are\r\nused. Where and by whom the texts of the Book of\r\nthe Dead were composed is also unknown . There is\r\nno good reason for assuming that they are the offspring of the minds of Libyans or dwellers of Central\r\nAfrica, they cannot be the literary product of savages\r\nor negroes, there is no evidence to shew that they\r\nare of Semitic origin, and the general testimony of\r\ntheir contents indicates an Asiatic home for their birthplace . Certain of the ideas expressed in the earliest\r\nform of the Book of the Dead known to us are gross\r\nand brutal, but they were retained rather by the conservative spirit of the Egyptians than by any belief\r\nin them ; their reverence for ancient writings and\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLVII\r\ncustoms is too well known to need comment here .\r\nThat such texts should suffer modification as time\r\nwent on is only to be expected, but we may be sure\r\nthat the original purpose of them remained unchanged,\r\nand that all really essential ideas and beliefs of a\r\nfundamental character found expression always in the\r\nsame way. Wherever its original home may have been,\r\nor whatever was its origin, or whoever were its authors, it is quite certain that the Book of the Dead,\r\nin a connected form, is as old as Egyptian civilization,\r\nand that its sources belong to prehistoric times to\r\nwhich it is impossible to assign a date .\r\nWe first touch solid ground in the history of the\r\nBook of the Dead in the period of the early dynasties,\r\nand, if we accept one tradition which was current in\r\nEgypt as early as B . C. 2500, we are right in believing that certain parts of it are, in their present form,\r\nas old as the time of the first dynasty . The LXIVth\r\nChapter, which is admitted on all hands to be exceedingly old, exists in two versions . The rubric to\r\none of these declares that the Chapter is as old as\r\nthe time of Hesepti, the fifth king of the first dynasty,\r\nabout B . C . 4266, and says that it was \"found\" beneath\r\nthe Hennu boat by the foreman of the builders ; and\r\nthe rubric to the other (see pp . i 18, 1 19) states that\r\nit was \"found\" at Hermopolis, inscribed upon a block\r\nof ironstone, by Herutataf (the son of Khufu or Cheops,\r\nthe second king of the IVth dynasty, about B. C .\r\n3733), when he was inspecting the temples throughout\r\nX LV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe country . These opinions find expression upon\r\ncoffins of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties and in\r\npapyri of the best period, that is to say, from about\r\nB . C. i 6oo to B . C. i o00 ; and though one makes out\r\nthe Chapter to be some six hundred years older than\r\nthe other, both agree in assigning to it a date which\r\nis coaeval with the Early Empire . It is difficult to\r\nknow what is exactly meant by the word \"found\" .\r\nIt may, of course, mean that a stone slab bearing the\r\ntext of the Chapter was discovered whilst certain repairs or alterations were being carried out in the\r\ntemple of the god Thoth at Hermopolis, or it may\r\nmean that the Chapter was edited in some way by\r\nKhufu's son Herutataf. The latter explanation is certainly the more probable, for we know from other\r\nsources that Herutataf was a learned man, and that\r\nhe was the author of various literary works, which\r\nenjoyed a considerable reputation . On the other hand,\r\nthe ancient custom of ascribing the works of unknown\r\nauthors to famous men may have already been in\r\nvogue .\r\nOf the Book of the Dead of the second, third, and\r\nfourth dynasties we know nothing, and no copies of\r\nany part of the Recension then in use have come\r\ndown to us ; the texts on the tombs of the priests of\r\nthat period spew that funeral ceremonies were performed in accordance with the instructions contained\r\nin the rubrics to the various Chapters of the Book\r\nof the Dead, and the existence of collections of reli-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLIX\r\ngious texts stands assured . During the reign of Menkau-Ra, the Mycerinus of the Greeks, the fourth king\r\nof the fourth dynasty, about B . C . 3633, certain Chapters, i . e ., XXXB and CXLVIII, are said to have been\r\nfound by Herutat tf, and there are traditions extant\r\nthat religious ceremonies were performed with renewed vigour during the reign of this king. On the\r\ncoffin of Men-kau-Ra (Brit . Mus. No . 664.7) are inscribed two lines' of text which are also found on the walls\r\ninside the pyramids of Teta and Pepi I, kings of the\r\nsixth dynasty ; it would be absurd to suppose that\r\nthese lines formed the only portion of the text known\r\nin the fourth dynasty, and thus we are entitled to\r\nassume that the same Recension of the Book of the\r\nDead which was known and copied in the sixth dynasty was also known and copied in the fourth dynasty. From the lines on the coffin of Men-kau-Ra\r\nwe learn some interesting facts : namely, that the dead\r\nking was identified with the god, that the divine origin of the god was ascribed also to the king, that\r\nthe life of the king in the world beyond . the grave\r\nwas to be that of a god, that all his foes were to\r\nbe vanquished, and that he was to become a being\r\npossessed of life everlasting . Here, then, is a proof\r\nof the acceptance of the Osiris story and of the doci . They read : \"[Hail,] Osiris, king of the North and South, Men-kau-\r\n\"Ra, living for ever! born of heaven, conceived of Nut, heir of Seb his\r\n\"beloved. Thy mother Nut spreadeth herself over thee in her name of\r\n\" `mystery of heaven' ; she granteth that thou mayest exist as a god with-\r\n\"out thy foes, O king of the North and South, Men-kau-Rd, living forever .\"\r\nd\r\nL\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ntrine of immortality, or everlasting life, at a very remote period in Egypt .\r\nDuring the period of the fifth and sixth dynasties\r\na remarkable development took place in the funeral\r\nceremonies performed for Egyptian kings . The kings\r\nof the fourth dynasty Khufu (Cheops), Kha - f - Ra\r\n(Khephren), and Men-kau-Ra had built for their tombs\r\nthe stone pyramids at Gizeh, which to this day excite\r\nthe wonder and admiration of the civilized world, but\r\nthe walls of the chambers and corridors are uninscribed, and they tell us nothing of the texts which\r\nwere recited during the funeral, and nothing of the\r\nceremonies by which they were accompanied . At the\r\nclose of the fifth dynasty, however, Unas the king\r\n(B. C . 3333) built as his tomb a stone pyramid at a\r\nplace now called Sakkara, which is situated on the\r\nwest bank of the Nile, a few miles to the south of\r\nthe modern city of Cairo, and he covered the greater\r\nparts of the walls of the chambers, corridors, etc.,\r\nwith several hundred vertical lines of hieroglyphic\r\ntext which were deeply cut and filled up with green\r\npaint or composition . In the year 1881 M . Maspero\r\neffected an entrance into this pyramid, and he recognized at once the fact that the inscriptions which he\r\nsaw before him formed the text of the Book of the\r\nDead which was in use in Egypt during the period of\r\nthe fifth dynasty . Continuing his labours in this \"pyramid field\" he opened the pyramids of Teta, Pepi I,\r\nMer-en-Ra, and Pepi II, kings of the sixth dynasty who\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLI\r\nreigned from about B . C . 33oo to B . C . 3i66, and he\r\nfound that the texts which covered the walls inside\r\nwere duplicates, with additions, of those which he\r\nhad already found in the pyramid of Unas .' We thus\r\nsee, for the first time, a collected series of texts of\r\nthe Book of the Dead in the earliest Recension known\r\nto us ; this Recension may for convenience be called\r\nthe `Heliopolitan', because it bears unmistakable evidence that it was drawn up by the priests of Annu\r\n(On or Heliopolis), and that it contains the peculiar\r\nviews held by the priests of the colleges of that very\r\nancient city . Though five sets of extracts from it have\r\ncome down to us in a tolerably complete state of\r\npreservation, we must not assume that they represent\r\nall the texts which belonged to it, indeed the various\r\nsections of it which were copied upon funeral monuments and papyri in later times indicate that for all\r\npractical purposes its extent was illimitable . How much\r\n\"editing\" was done to the texts of this Recension by\r\nthe priests of Annu cannot be said, but there is considerable evidence scattered throughout it which shews\r\nthat they had been edited two or three times before,\r\nand it is clear that we have preserved in it many\r\nreligious ideas and beliefs which belong to what may\r\nbe termed strata of religious thought of different\r\ni . These texts, together with French translations, have been published\r\nby M . Maspero under the title of Les Inscriptions des Pyramides de Saqgarah, Paris, 1894 ; the various sections of this work had before appeared\r\nin Recueil de Travaux, tom. III . ff.\r\nd*\r\nL11\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nperiods and dates . Some of them certainly go back\r\nto a period in the history of the Egyptians when they\r\ncelebrated their triumphs over their enemies in a brutal\r\nand savage fashion, and others belong to a time when\r\ntheir ancestors stood but little higher on the ladder\r\nof civilization than the barbarous tribes who lived on\r\ntheir western and southern frontiers .\r\nThe Heliopolitan Recension of the Book of the Dead\r\nconsists of a series of paragraphs, each of which is\r\nintroduced by the word \"recite\" ;scattered throughout the text are directions to the priests who performed the ceremonies when to make certain presentations of meat, drink, and other objects . In later\r\ndays the rubrical directions were written at the\r\nends of the sections, and titles were given to the\r\nsections, which henceforth became special Chapters,\r\nintended to produce certain definite results .

Of the\r\nhistory, too, of the period of the seventh, eighth, ninth,\r\nand tenth dynasties very little is known, and though\r\nin certain districts in Upper Egypt tombs of considerable size and beauty were built, yet no striking development in the funeral texts seems to have taken\r\nplace, or, if it did, we have no record of it .

HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLV\r\nwe have a number of coffins of considerable importance for the study of the Book of the Dead. They\r\nmay be roughly divided into three classes : (i) those\r\nwhich are painted to represent funeral chambers or\r\ntombs, (2) those which are almost plain outside but\r\ncovered inside with texts in the hieratic or cursive\r\nEgyptian character, and (3) those which are inscribed\r\nboth inside and out . The texts are usually traced in\r\nblack upon the planed surface of the wood, the chief inscriptions which record the name and titles of the deceased being painted in large hieroglyphics either in\r\na vertical line down the length of the cover, or in a\r\nhorizontal line round the upper part of the four sides\r\nof the coffin . On the right hand side, at the foot, is\r\noften painted or inlaid the double utch'n 0M, or\r\nso-called \"symbolic eyes\" . Plates I and II illustrate\r\nas far as possible without the use of colours the arrangement of the text on such coffins . The scene in\r\nPlate I is from one end (inside) of the famous coffin\r\nof Amamu (Brit. plus . No. 6,654) . The border with its\r\npattern of rectangles is painted in bright colours, red,\r\ngreen, and yellow, and all round the upper part of\r\nthe sides are painted the principal objects which formed\r\nthe usual offerings to the dead, and a prayer that the\r\ndeceased may have such things offered in his tomb\r\nfor ever. Here we see vases and jars of various\r\nshapes and sizes filled with unguents and cosmetics,\r\nthe names of which are given in the line of hieroglyphics above them ; they are set upon a stand,\r\nLVI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nbroken examples of which have been from time to\r\ntime found in tombs . Each of the vertical lines of\r\ntext begins with the word U\r\nr\r\n\"recite\", a fact which\r\nshews that the text was usually inscribed upon the\r\nwalls of tombs . Plate II gives an extract from the\r\ntext inscribed upon the coffin of Sebek-aa preserved\r\nat Berlin. It will be noticed that the hieroglyphics\r\nhave begun to assume a conventional form, and that\r\nthey do not so readily suggest the objects which they\r\nrepresent . We notice, too, that the various sections\r\non such coffins have specific titles attached to them,\r\nin other words they have become \"Chapters\" . As the\r\npyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasties do not all\r\ncontain the same selection of extracts from the Book\r\nof the Dead, so the coffins of the eleventh and twelfth\r\ndynasties do not all contain the same selection of\r\nChapters ; this fact shews that the selection of the\r\nextracts and Chapters did not follow any general rule,\r\nbut whether it depended upon the will and discretion\r\nof the scribe or the deceased cannot be said . Down\r\nthe length of the bottom of the coffin inside was frequently painted a band of white across which were\r\ntraced in blue wavy lines to indicate water ; this probably represented the celestial Nile, or the stream\r\nupon which the deceased hoped to float to the Elysian Fields . We must note, in passing, that at the\r\nperiod when these coffins were made no pyramids\r\nwere inscribed with extracts or Chapters from the\r\nBook of the Dead ; in other words, it was found both\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE Xlth and XIIth\r\nDYNASTY.\r\nPLATE II .\r\nFrom the Sarcophagus of Sebek-Aa.

LVII\r\ncheaper and easier to write the text with ink or colours upon planks which could be afterwards pegged\r\ntogether to form coffins . This custom resulted in the\r\ncurtailment of the selection of texts, and in less than\r\na thousand years after the religious texts in the pyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasties were cut, we\r\nfind that certain portions of them had fallen into disuse.\r\nWe have already seen that a period lies between\r\nthe sixth and eleventh dynasties (luring which we\r\nknow nothing of the Book of the Dead, and again\r\nduring the period which lies between the twelfth and\r\neighteenth dynasties we know nothing of it . With the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth dynasty the Book of the\r\nDead begins a new phase of its existence, and a development of its history as interesting as it is unexpected is before us . From pyramids the transition\r\nwas to coffins, and now the transition is from coffins\r\nto papyri. And here again economy probably played\r\nan important part. Inscribed pyramids, and sarcophagi,\r\nand coffins would, necessarily, be only made for royal\r\npersonages and for great and wealthy folk, lout a roll\r\nof papyrus was, in comparison with these, a very inexpensive thing, especially if the services of an ordinary scribe were employed in inscribing it .\r\nThe greater number of the copies of the Book of\r\nthe Dead inscribed upon papyri have been found at\r\nThebes, indeed those made in this city are of such\r\nimportance, that to the Recension of the work which\r\nLV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nwe commonly find in use in Egypt from the eighteenth\r\nto the twenty-second dynasty the name \"Theban\" has\r\nbeen given . We owe them chiefly to the scribes and\r\npriests who were attached to the powerful confraternity of the priests of \"Amen-Ra, the king of the gods\",\r\nand, speaking generally, the best 1-ISS . are found in\r\ntheir tombs and coffins . The original home of the texts\r\nwhich they copied, was, of course, Memphis or Heliopolis, and there is reason for believing that during\r\nthe earlier centuries of their existence they did little\r\nmore than adopt the religious views and doctrines of\r\nthe sages of the North . As time went on, and the\r\nworshippers of Amen obtained greater power, this god\r\nwas slowly but surely made to usurp the attributes\r\nof the older cosmic gods of Egypt, and eventually,\r\nas we see in Chapter CLXXI (infra, p. 315), his name\r\nis included among those of the old gods of the Book\r\nof the Dead.\r\nThe papyri inscribed with copies of the Theban\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead vary in length\r\nfrom about 15 to go feet, and in width from 12 to\r\n18 inches ; in many cases the various pieces which\r\nform the papyrus are so carefully put together that\r\nit is almost impossible to see where one piece ends\r\nand the other begins . In the early part of the eighteenth dynasty the text is always written with black\r\nink in vertical columns of hieroglyphics, which are\r\nseparated from each other by black lines ; the titles\r\nof the Chapters, and the initial word or words of\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XVIIIth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Nebseni, Brit .

In the eighteenth\r\ndynasty, or perhaps a little earlier, the scribes began to ornament the papyri with designs in black\r\noutline, referring to the subject matter of the text\r\nnear which they were placed ; such designs, or \"vignettes\", as they are usually called, occupy quite a\r\nsubordinate position, and they were drawn most probably by the scribe . Little by little, however, they\r\nincreased in number, and it became the fashion to\r\nilluminate them with bright colours, greens, reds, yellows. In the nineteenth dynasty the unilluminated\r\npapyrus became the exception, and the Vignettes\r\nflourished at the expense of the text . An idea of the\r\nbeauty of a fully coloured papyrus of the best period\r\nmay be gained from the frontispiece to this volume\r\nand from the plates which face pp . i 9 and 170, and\r\nPlates III -VIII will illustrate the characteristics of good\r\nMSS. of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, except as to colour. Plate III illustrates the writing\r\nand Vignettes of the famous Papyrus of Nebseni (Brit.\r\nMus. No. 9,900) which was found at Memphis ; it measures 77 feet 7'\/, in ., by i ft. i '\/, in ., and contains\r\nseventy-seven Chapters, not including duplicates and\r\ntriplicates . The Vignettes are traced in outline and\r\nare remarkably well drawn ; and both Vignettes and\r\ntext appear to be the work of one scribe, probably\r\nNebseni himself. The Papyrus of Nebseni was apparently written early in the eighteenth dynasty . Plate IV\r\nLX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncontains a Vignette and a piece of text from the Papyrus of Nu (Brit. Mus. No . 10,477), which was found\r\nat Thebes ; it measures 65 ft. 3 ' \/ 2 in., by i ft . 1 '\/2 in .,\r\nand contains one hundred and thirty-one Chapters .\r\nThough shorter than the Papyrus of Nebseni, the texts\r\ninscribed on it are more numerous, for the writing is\r\nsmaller and the lines are closer together . Some of\r\nthe Chapters have Vignettes, but they occupy an entirely subordinate position, and the colouring is not\r\nas fine as that found in documents of a later date .\r\nThe date of this papyrus cannot be much later than\r\nthat of Nebseni. On Plate V we have an example of\r\nthe very fine, bold writing which is found in the Papyrus of Ani (Brit. Mus . No . 10,470), which was found\r\nat Thebes ; this document measures 78 feet by i ft .\r\n3 in ., and contains sixty-six Chapters . It is the finest\r\nof all the illuminated papyri of the eighteenth dynasty, and from an artistic point of view its value is\r\ngreater than that of any other papyrus . It is made\r\nup of six distinct lengths of papyrus which have been\r\nneatly joined ; the text was written by several scribes,\r\nand the Vignettes are the work of more than one artist . An examination of the document shews that the\r\nartist's work was done before the text was written ;\r\nat times the space needed for the text was miscalculated, and the scribe was compelled to reduce the\r\nsize of his writing, and even to write words on the\r\ncoloured border within which text and Vignettes are\r\nenclosed. The first sixteen feet of the papyrus were\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XVIIIth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Ani, Brit. Mus .

The Hymn to Osiris on Plate VI is\r\nprobably in Ani's own handwriting, and the characters are formed with an attention to detail not often\r\nfound elsewhere . The Vignettes and text on plate VII\r\nshew the work of two scribes and two artists, and\r\nalso shew that the inscribed portion of one section\r\nwas done on a larger scale than was contemplated\r\nin the earlier sections ; here we see that the borders\r\nhad to be enlarged to make the join . From this we\r\nsee, too, that the planning of a papyrus was a matter which was left to the discretion of the artist and\r\nscribe ; and when we consider that the Papyrus of\r\nNebseni contains duplicates and even triplicates of\r\nsome Chapters, and that the Papyrus of Ani contains\r\ntwo copies of Chapter XVIII (one with an introduction and one without), slightly differing from each\r\nother and having the sections of the Vignette arranged\r\ndifferently, it is clear that even the best scribes did\r\nnot tie themselves to any one plan or method in preparing a copy of the Book of the Dead . We may\r\nnote too that in the Papyrus of Ani a large section\r\nof the text of Chapter XVII has been omitted by the\r\nscribe, probably because the artist had not left sufficient space for the whole Chapter . In the text, moreover, several palpable errors occur, but, on the other\r\nhand, we have in the Vignettes descriptions of mythological scenes, names of gods, etc ., which occur in\r\nLXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nno other text ; \u2022a mong these worthy of special mention are the judgment Scene and the accompanying\r\ntexts, and the Vignette to the XVII th Chapter .\r\nPlate VIII gives us a Vignette and a few lines of\r\ntext from the Papyrus of Hu-nefer, a scribe and superintendent of cattle who flourished in the reign of\r\nSeti I, about B . C . 13 70 ; the cartouche of the king\r\naffords conclusive proof as to its date . This document\r\nis remarkable from many points of view . It is the\r\nshortest perfect MS . of its class known, measuring\r\ni8 feet by i ft. 3 3\/8 in. The Vignettes are beautiful\r\nspecimens of the artist's work, and the scene in which\r\nthe performance of the ceremony of \"Opening the\r\nMouth\" is depicted is the most perfect known ; but\r\nthe Vignette to Chapter XVII is imperfect when compared with that of the Papyrus of Ani . The copy of\r\nChapter I is so good that M . Naville employed it as\r\nthe standard text in his Todtenbuch, but the copy of\r\nChapter XVII is so incomplete and incorrect that he\r\nfound it useless even for purposes of comparison .\r\nHere again we see that the Vignettes were executed\r\nat the expense of the text ; in spite of this, however,\r\nthe papyrus is valuable, for it contains a Hymn to\r\nOsiris by the god Thoth which is not found elsewhere\r\nin the same form. The text is written in a good,\r\nbold hand, but with little attention to the details of\r\nthe characters ; and the judgment Scene exhibits many\r\npeculiarities, both in respect of text and arrangement.\r\nPlates IX and X illustrate the Vignettes and the\r\nI\r\nCD\r\na\r\nz\r\n0\r\ns\r\nx\r\nw\r\nr\r\nz\r\nO\r\nQ\r\nw\r\n0\r\nl\r\nLip 1 7rAlIt ~~pb ~4 '~f dpi\r\n\r\n_ 0~3 ~oPd\u00AEpubo~: p\r\nFIN\r\n\\ 1 \\\\\r\n\r\ny\r\n,~F\r\nI\r\nV'Q :~I :QICI c ij;~\r\n~o~~ :O1w14) 3~_1$I~I o c==\" i s\r\n\r\nD o \u00A90~\r\n1~wC=n1(II~\r\nIvil Wig\r\n~(: F\r\n_\r\nCIO\r\nf~,~7i\r\n~d' ~~OLOi\r\nG~}dl~~ II\r\n'\r\nL( d~~I:~ l(~fl ~M\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XIXth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Hu-nefer, Brit .

In Plate IX we\r\nsee the \"royal mother Netchemet\" standing behind\r\nher son Her-Heru ; the dress and ornaments of these\r\nroyal personages shew the change which has taken\r\nplace in such matters since the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, and in the manner of depicting them .\r\nThe colours of the Vignettes are more crude, the\r\ndelicacy of design and of execution alike has departed, and a comparison of the text with that of the\r\nPapyrus of Nu shews that the skill of the scribe had\r\ndeteriorated . The hieratic text on Plate X gives an\r\nexcellent idea of the writing of the period . In the\r\ntwentieth dynasty Books of the Dead inscribed for\r\nthe priests of Amen began with a Vignette, either\r\nplain or coloured, in which the deceased was seen\r\nmaking offerings to Osiris or to the gods of Thebes .\r\nThis was followed by a selection of Chapters from\r\nthe Book of the Dead in use in the eighteenth dynasty,\r\nor by a series of texts peculiar to the period accompanied by Vignettes taken from other funeral works .\r\nSometimes, as in the case of the Princess Nesi-Khonsu,\r\nthe document begins with a long, detailed list of the\r\ntitles of Amen-Ra, who by this time had usurped the\r\nattributes of the old gods of Egypt, which is followed\r\nby a series of statements in which the god, in apparently legal language, swears to confer every favour\r\npossible upon the deceased lady . Such documents are\r\nnot very long, and they are usually much narrower\r\nLXIV\r\n\r\nINTROD UCTION.\r\nthan Books of the Dead of the earlier period . The\r\nmythological figures and scenes characteristic of the\r\nlater documents of the priests of Amen are not yet\r\nwell understood, for only a few have been published\r\nin entirety.\r\nOf papyri of the twenty-first dynasty which preserve many characteristics of the earlier period may\r\nbe mentioned that of Anhai, a priestess of Amen\r\n(Brit . Mus. No. 10,472), a section of which is shewn\r\non Plate XI. Here we have, however, a work sui\r\ngenerzs which is very instructive from many points\r\nof view. The artist's work is the most valuable part\r\nof the papyrus, and the use of gold for purposes of\r\nillumination appears for the first time . In addition to\r\nthe Vignettes of the older period we find here the\r\nscene of the Creation given much as it is found on\r\nthe Sarcophagus of Seti I, and a rare Vignette which\r\nseems to refer to Khemennu, the city of Thoth . The\r\ntexts are fragmentary and often. have no connexion\r\nwith the Vignettes which accompany them, but many\r\nof the Vignettes are of considerable interest . The\r\nhandwriting is, in some places, very good, but it\r\nlacks the bold firmness which is characteristic of the\r\nolder scribes . In papyri of the eighteenth dynasty we\r\nfind many mistakes, but most of them may be attributed to momentary carelessness on the part of a\r\nweary scribe ; whereas in those of the twenty-first and\r\nsucceeding dynasties the writers of the texts seem\r\nto be altogether reckless . Texts are copied beginning\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Queen Netchemet, in the possession of H .R .H .\r\nthe Prince of Wales.\r\nPLATE IX.\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXth DYNASTY .\r\n4 Rj\r\n\r\n~ ~ a .ii ~?r~rc\r\nCn\t+I,- D--. .a t-f__Liuann NAtnhamAt Rnit Miic_ Nn_ 1(L4ACL shppt 4.\r\nPLATE X .\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLXV\r\nat the end instead of at the beginning, omissions of\r\nwhole sections are frequent, texts that have proper\r\nVignettes are copied without the least regard to the\r\ncorrect Vignettes, and what is intended to be a Chapter frequently consists of nothing but a series of fragments of sentences copied without break merely to\r\nfill up the space which the artist had spared for the\r\npurpose. It seems as if the artist both painted the\r\nVignettes and wrote the text, and as if his sole aim\r\nwas to produce a handsome, but not accurate, document. The contents of the papyri reflect, no doubt,\r\nthe religious views commonly held at that period,\r\nand, if this be so, it is clear that the priests of Amen\r\nheld the texts, which they inserted alongside of the\r\nChapters of the older period, to be of equal value\r\nand authority. Some of them went so far as fill their\r\npapyri with religious compositions which are never\r\nto be found in the old works. In Plate XII we have a\r\nVignette with a few lines of text from the papyrus\r\nBrit. Mus . No. 10,478, which I believe was written in\r\nthe twenty-second dynasty . The artist's work is a copy,\r\nor rather a very poor imitation, of the illuminating\r\nof the nineteenth dynasty, and the text consists of a\r\nseries of compositions referring to the offerings which\r\nwere to be made to the gods of the Qerti, or divisions of the underworld . Strictly speaking, these have\r\nnothing whatever to do with the Book of the Dead,\r\nbut in the opinion of the scribe they were equally\r\nefficacious . In the same dynasty a large number of\r\ne\r\nLXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncopies of selections of Chapters from the Book of the\r\nDead were written in hieratic, with Vignettes traced\r\nin outline in black ink. In some of these the papyrus measures about 40 ft . by i ft . 6 in ., and in others\r\nthe dimensions are considerably less . An idea of the\r\nappearance of such papyri may be gained from Plate\r\nXIII, which illustrates both the fine drawing and small\r\nbut clear hieratic writing of the period . It is probable\r\nthat the Books of the Dead written in hieratic during\r\nthe twentieth, twenty-first, and twenty-second dynasties\r\nbelong to a Recension different in many respects from\r\nthe Theban, but that such Recension is akin to the\r\nTheban there is no doubt whatever . In both the Chapters have no fixed order, and in both the Chapters\r\nhave special titles, a characteristic which distinguishes\r\nthem from the sections of the Books of the Dead of\r\nthe fifth, sixth, eleventh and twelfth dynasties . It is\r\ntolerably easy to identify the papyri which were inscribed before B . C . goo, in fact, as long as the power\r\nof the priests of Amen was paramount at Thebes, the\r\ncopies of the Books of the Dead which were inscribed for them reflect the prosperity of the confraternity. But when it became necessary for the priests\r\nto hide at Der el-bahari the mummies of the kings and\r\nqueens who had been their greatest benefactors,\r\nand troublous times came upon them, everything relating to the rites and ceremonies connected with the\r\ndead suffered, and the relatives and friends of the\r\ndead were obliged to do for them not what they\r\nPLATE XT.

Eventually, it would seem,\r\na time came when no Books of the Dead were written, and this period corresponds, I believe, to the\r\nfinal failure of the domination of the priests of Amen .\r\nThis is not the place to lament the mistake which\r\nthe priests of Amen made when they tried to rule\r\nEgypt temporally as well as spiritually, or to regret the\r\npolicy which made them exalt their god Amen above\r\nthe older gods of the country whom the people had\r\nknown and worshipped from time immemorial ; it is\r\nsufficient to know that in each matter they failed .\r\nThey lost their own temporal power as the result of\r\ntheir intrigues, and at best they only succeeded in\r\nobtaining for their god a place side by side with the\r\nold gods. It must, however, not be forgotten that we\r\nowe some of the best and finest copies of the Book\r\nof the Dead to scribes who had married priestesses\r\nof Amen, and who were themselves attached to the\r\nbrotherhood .\r\nWith the rise of the kings of the twenty-sixth dynasty to power the Book of the Dead enters upon a\r\nnew lease of life, and a general revival of ancient\r\nreligious customs took place ; the temples were repaired, ancient and long forgotten texts were re-copied, and artists and sculptors took their models from\r\nthe best works of the masters of the Early Empire .\r\nEarly in this dynasty, it appears, the priesthood which\r\nsucceeded the priests of Amen awoke to the consciousness of the fact that the texts of the Book of\r\ne*\r\nLXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe Dead needed re-editing and re-arranging, and\r\nthey set to work to try to put some system into them .\r\nHow and when exactly the work was done we know\r\nnot, but it is probable that it was carried out by an\r\nassembly or college of priests . We have seen above\r\nthat scribes tied themselves to no one plan in making\r\ntheir copies of the Book of the Dead and that the\r\nwork of the artist on the Vignettes (which were subordinate matters originally) was at times allowed to\r\ndrive the text from the papyrus ; in the best papyri,\r\ntoo, the selection of texts copied is never the same,\r\nand the order of them is never the same . In fact each\r\npapyrus had a plan of its own . These things the\r\npriests of the twenty-sixth dynasty tried to correct,\r\nand the result of their labours was a Recension of\r\nthe Book of the Dead which is usually called the\r\n\"Saite\" . A number of papyri are extant which are\r\ninscribed therewith, and an examination of them shews\r\nthat the Chapters follow a certain order, and that although the papyri vary in length, the selection of\r\nChapters being not as full in some of them as in others,\r\nthis order has few exceptions. Each of the early Recensions of the Book of the Dead known to us exhibits peculiarities which reflect the religious views of\r\nthe time when it was written, and the Saite Recension is not an exception to the rule, for included in\r\nit are four Chapters (CLXII-CLXV) which have no\r\ncounterparts in the papyri of the older period ; they\r\nare remarkable also for containing a number of for-\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXIInd DYNASTY.\r\nr\r\nL+~ ~\r\n\r\nq#q tt ! .\r\nti9.1 3lott- ;rt V).*aa I ftI . t\r\nR J\r\na\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Heru-em-heb, Brit .

It has been suggested that these Chapters\r\nare of Nubian origin, and if so it would be interesting to know the circumstances under which they were\r\ninserted in the Book of the Dead . It is difficult to\r\nidentify with certainty the papyri which were actually\r\nwritten during the twenty-sixth dynasty, but MSS .\r\nwritten in the period immediately preceding the Ptolemaic are not difficult to recognize . Plate XIV gives\r\nfourteen lines of text and part of a Vignette from a\r\ndocument of this class (Brit . Mus . No . 10,479), and\r\nshews what a well defined class it is . The text is\r\nwritten with black ink in vertical columns of spidery\r\nhieroglyphics separated by black lines, and the Vignettes occupy small spaces above it ; the Vignettes\r\nof the Sunrise or Sunset, the Judgment Scene, and the\r\nElysian Fields occupy the whole length of the papyrus .\r\nSometimes the Vignettes are all mixed together, but,\r\neven when coloured, they lack the artistic appearance\r\nand good work of the illuminated papyri of the\r\neighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties .\r\nThe Recension in use in the Ptolemaic period is\r\nwell illustrated by Plate XV, which is reproduced\r\nfrom Lepsius' edition of the Turin Papyrus ; this papyrus is probably the best and longest MS . of the\r\nclass known. The selection of Chapters is remarkably\r\nfull ; the number of Chapters, however, is not 165\r\nbut 153, for three of them (Chaps . XVI, CXLIII, and\r\nCL) are in reality Vignettes, and nine others (Chaps .\r\nXLVIII, XLIX, LXXIII, CV1I, CXI, CXX, CXXI,\r\nLXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nCXXIX, and CXXXIX) are duplicates of Chapters\r\nfound in other parts of the papyrus . The titles of the\r\nChapters, catch-words, parts of Rubrics, etc ., are\r\nwritten in red .\r\nMeanwhile, however, a number of short religious\r\nworks for funeral use had been composed, presumably\r\nby the priests, and it seems that towards the end of\r\nthe PtolemaIc period it was more usual to inscribe\r\nthese upon papyri than the Chapters of the old Recensions of the Book of the Dead . It seems as if an\r\nattempt was made to extract only the essential portions of the old works and to omit from the shortened\r\nnew texts the Chapters which referred to faiths which\r\nwere dead and to beliefs which had little or no influence\r\nin those modern times . Added to this, the knowledge\r\nof such matters must have disappeared from the community long before the Ptolemies ruled the land, and,\r\nthough the belief in the resurrection of the spiritual\r\nbody and in life everlasting beyond the grave retained its power over the people as firmly as ever,\r\nmost men had no knowledge whatever of the texts\r\nwhich their forefathers who were dead and gone\r\nimagined to be necessary for the attainment of the\r\nsame . The sepulchral stelae and coffins shew that\r\nneither the employer nor the employed had an exact\r\nidea of the import of the texts and symbols which\r\nwere cut or painted upon them, and to ignorance\r\nas much as to haste must be attributed the blunders\r\nwhich occur in funeral texts of this period .

LXXI\r\nthere we find an attempt to preserve Vignettes and\r\ntexts of the old period along with the modern work,\r\nand a good example of this class of document is the\r\nPapyrus of Kerasher (Brit . Mus . No . 9,995), a portion\r\nof which is reproduced on Plate XVI. Here we have\r\na representation of the judgment Scene, crude alike\r\nin colour and detail, a part of the Vignette of the\r\nfirst Chapter of the old Book of the Dead, a number of the Pylons discussed in Chapters CXLV and\r\nCXLVI, etc ., and two horizontal lines of hieroglyphics\r\nwhich contain prayers reflecting those of an earlier\r\nperiod. No MS . could more clearly shew how little\r\nknowledge of the old Book of the Dead remained in\r\nthe hands of the scribes at that time ; artistic skill,\r\nmoreover, had sunk very low, for it will be noticed\r\nthat the censer which the white-skirted priest is carrying before the bier, and which he was supposed to\r\ncarry in his hand, is almost as long as he is high !\r\nThe coloured portion of this papyrus is followed by\r\nthree columns of text in hieratic which form the work\r\nentitled SHAI EN SENSEN, or \"Book of Breathings\" (see\r\nPlate XVII), wherein we find no hymns, and no addresses to the gods, and in fact no words which do\r\nnot directly refer to the future life of the deceased\r\nin the world beyond the grave . Here we have an\r\nepitome of all that the Egyptian hoped to obtain in\r\nthe \"land of eternity\" .\r\nWe have now reached the end of the Graeco-Roman\r\nperiod, but the end of the Book of the Dead is not\r\nLXXII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nyet, for belonging to the Roman period we find a\r\nnumber of small rolls of papyri inscribed in very\r\ncursive hieratic with a series of statements or assertions referring to the happiness of the deceased in the\r\nnext world . Such papyri have no Vignettes, and as for\r\nthe texts, both hymns and Chapters of the old Book\r\nof the Dead in any Recension are as absent from them\r\nas if they had never existed . The aim of the writer\r\nof such documents was not to glorify the gods, but\r\nto secure the goods of the next world by means of\r\nthe smallest amount of writing possible, and at the\r\nleast expense . On Plate XVIII is reproduced a portion\r\nof a papyrus of this class (Brit . Mus . No. i o, i i i ), and\r\na comparison of it with the earlier Plates in this book\r\nwill shew at once the change which had come over\r\nthe Book of the Dead . What form the Book of the\r\nDead took in the early centuries of the Christian era\r\ncannot be said, but it seems not to have died out\r\nutterly, for selections from it are found copied upon\r\nthe outer and inner swathings of mummies and upon\r\ncoffins of the Roman Period ; on a coffin in Paris,\r\nwhich was probably made about the end of the second century of our era, are written a number of\r\ntexts which are as old as the time of the Pyramids at\r\nSakkara, and this fact proves that when such documents\r\nwere needed originals from which to copy them could\r\nalways be found . There is good reason for assuming\r\nthat the art of making mummies was practised until\r\nthe end of the fifth century of our era, and there is\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD (OR BOOK OF BREATHINGS)\r\nIN THE GR\/ECO-ROMAN PERIOD.\r\nPLATE X V11.\r\nFrom the Fapyrus of Kerasher, Brit .

LXX11I\r\nno doubt that in certain places the belief that the\r\npreservation of the natural body was absolutely necessary for the growth, development, and existence\r\nof the spiritual body, existed in full force until a\r\nmuch later date. It is not possible to assign a date\r\nto the period when the decay of the Book of the\r\nDead began, but it is probably contemporary with\r\nthe advent of the Greeks in Egypt . Up to that period\r\nEgypt may be described as the home of a nation that\r\nwas given up entirely to the care of the dead and\r\nto the consideration of the future life ; a few of its\r\nkings were soldiers in the true sense of the word,\r\nbut it is a striking fact that the temples and tombs\r\nof Egypt are the chief monuments of one of the oldest\r\nand greatest civilizations of the world. A tottering\r\nreligion would be rudely shaken by the invasions of\r\nthe country by Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and\r\nothers, and the permanent occupation of Egypt by\r\nGreeks and Romans would continue the work which\r\nfrequent disturbances throughout the country had begun . The final blow, however, was not inflicted until\r\nthe Egyptians began to renounce their own ancient\r\nreligion and to become converts of the preaching of\r\nSaint Mark and his followers ; when they were once\r\nable to believe that Christ had the power to raise up\r\ntheir bodies in a spiritual form they felt that there\r\nwas no need to have them mummified, and simultaneously the need for the Chapters of the Book of the\r\nDead disappeared .\r\nLXXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nWe are now able to summarize the various forms\r\nof the Book of the Dead as follows :It first existed in oral tradition only, and was next written down\r\nto preserve it ; of these forms nothing whatever is\r\nknown . The first historical Recension was that made\r\nby the priests of Heliopolis, and the oldest copies\r\nof it known are cut in hieroglyphics upon the walls\r\nof the chambers and passages inside the Pyramids\r\nof Sakkara of the fifth and sixth dynasties . The\r\nsecond Recension was written or painted upon sarcophagi and coffins of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties in cursive hieroglyphics . The third Recension was written in hieroglyphics upon papyri from\r\nthe eighteenth to the twentieth dynasty, the various\r\nChapters having no fixed order ; this Recension was\r\nillustrated by a large number of Vignettes. The fourth\r\nRecension was written in hieratic upon papyri during\r\nthe twenty-first and twenty-second dynasties, and included extracts from various funeral books which were\r\nillustrated by Vignettes of an unusual character . The\r\nfifth or Saite Recension was made, probably, in the\r\ntwenty-sixth dynasty ; the Chapters have a fixed order\r\nand were written on papyri both in hieratic and hieroglyphics. The sixth Recension which was in use in\r\nPtolemaic times much resembled the Saite, and may\r\nbe regarded as the last form of the Book of the Dead,\r\nfor the extracts from it written for the benefit of the\r\ndead upon small pieces of Papyri in the GraecoRoman and Roman periods need hardly be considered .\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . LXXV\r\nThus the great religious work of the Egyptians, which\r\nhad lasted for thousands of years and which in early\r\ntimes, cut in fine, bold hieroglyphics, covered the walls\r\nand passages of the tombs of kings, ended its existence\r\nin almost illegible scrawls hastily traced upon scraps\r\nof papyrus only a few inches square .\r\nFrom first to last throughout the Book of the Dead,\r\nwith the single exception of Herutataf, the second son\r\nof Cheops, no man is mentioned as the author or\r\nreviser of any Chapter or of any part of it ; certain\r\nChapters may shew the influence of the cult of a certain city or cities, but the Theban Book of the Dead,\r\nat all events, cannot be regarded as the work of\r\nany one man or body of men, and it does not represent the religious views and beliefs of any one part\r\nonly of Egypt . From time immemorial the god Thoth,\r\nwho was both the divine intelligence which at creation uttered the words that were carried into effect\r\nby Ptah and Khnemu, and the scribe of the gods,\r\nwas associated with the production of the Book of\r\nthe Dead, and, though he was primarily the god of\r\ntime and chronologer of heaven and earth, he appears frequently as the advocate and helper of the\r\ndeceased . In the CLXXXIInd Chapter (see p . 341)\r\nhe is called the `scribe of right and truth who abo-\r\n\"minateth sin\", and again, \"Behold, he is the writing\r\n\"reed of the god Neb-er-tcher, the lord of laws, who\r\n\"giveth forth the speech of wisdom and understanding, whose words have dominion over the two lands\" .\r\nLXXVI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nOf himself the god says, \"I am Thoth, the lord of\r\n\"right and truth, who trieth the right and the truth\r\n\"for the gods, the judge of words in their essence,\r\n\"whose words triumph over violence . . . . I have\r\n\"made Rd. to set as Osiris, and Osiris setteth as R i .\r\n\"setteth\" . The deeds which Thoth claims to have\r\ndone on behalf of Osiris are set forth at length in\r\nthe two hymns to Osiris which form the CLXXXIInd\r\nand CLXXXIIIrd Chapters (see p . 34o ff.) . In several\r\nplaces in the Book of the Dead the deceased is made\r\nto refer to the \"might of the words of the utterances\r\n\"of the god Thoth\", and much of what this god did\r\nfor \"his brother\" Osiris was effected by this power .\r\nThe belief in the efficacy of the words of Thoth continued till the latest period, for in the Book of Breathings\r\n(see p . CXCVII) we read, \"Thoth, the most mighty god,\r\n\"the lord of Khemennu, cometh to thee, and he writeth\r\n\"for thee the Book of Breathings with his own fingers\" .\r\nFinally, mention must be made of the various places\r\nin the tomb where the papyri inscribed with the Chapters of the Book of the Dead were placed . When the\r\nEgyptians ceased to cut the Chapters on the walls\r\nof the chambers and passages of pyramids, they wrote\r\nor painted them upon the sides, inner and outer, of\r\nwooden coffins, and this custom obtained until the\r\nend of the rule of the native kings of Egypt, about\r\nB . C. 350 ; the Vignettes were copied upon coffins,\r\nlong after all knowledge of their meaning had been\r\nforgotten, until as late as the third century of our\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . LXXVII\r\nera . The inscribed papyrus was sometimes placed in\r\na separate box beside the coffin, and sometimes a\r\nniche in the wall was specially cut for it ; the most\r\nperfect of the papyri known have been found in niches .\r\nFrequently the papyrus was laid by the side of the\r\nmummy in the coffin, and in this case it is usually\r\nfound broken by the movements of the mummy when\r\nthe coffin was carried along . More frequently the\r\npapyrus was laid under the hands and between the\r\nthighs before the final swathing took place ; it was\r\nalso placed between the legs just above the ankles .\r\nSuch papyri are usually much broken, and they are\r\noften much discoloured by the moisture of the substances, bitumen, cedar oil, etc ., used in the process\r\nof embalmment . In the time of the greatest power of\r\nthe priests of Amen, in the twenty-first dynasty, large\r\nwooden figures of Osiris standing upon a pedestal\r\nwere made to serve as cases for the papyri,\r\nwhich were tightly rolled up and tied, and pushed\r\nup inside the figures through holes in the bottom of\r\nthe pedestals .' In later times, about B . C . 3oo, the\r\nfigures were made solid, and vertical cavities were\r\ncut in the backs of them to hold the papyri ; still\r\nlater, i. c ., in the Roman period, when the papyri\r\nbecame very small, they were laid in cavities in the\r\nsides of the pedestals, which also contained mummified portions wrapped in linen of the bodies of the\r\ni . A good example of this class of figure, that of Anhai, a priestess\r\nof Amen, is figured in my Mummy, p. 216 .\r\nLXXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\npersons for whom they were made . Over the mummified remains, which are placed in the upper parts of\r\nthe pedestals, we often find small models of sepulchral\r\nchests or coffins surmounted by figures of Anubis and\r\nhawks . The figure of the god above is no longer that\r\nof Osiris simply, but it represents the triune god PtahSeker-Ausar, the god of the resurrection, and has all\r\nthe attributes which belong to the ancient gods Ptah\r\nand Seker . In this trinity the creator of the world,\r\nthe sun, and Osiris as god of the dead were represented . Some think that Ptah in this trinity represents\r\nthe personification of the period of incubation which\r\nfollows death and precedes the entry into eternal life .\r\nThe exact position of Seker cannot be definitely described ; he is usually depicted as a mummied body\r\nwith the head of a hawk, and he sometimes holds in\r\nhis hands the emblems of power, rule, and sovereignty which belong to Osiris ; he is said to be the\r\nincarnation of the Apis bull at Memphis .\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION .\r\nIt will be noticed in reading the translation of the\r\nBook of the Dead given in this volume that the deceased is always identified with the god Osiris, and\r\nthat he is frequently called by the god's name . And\r\nif the religious texts written for the benefit of the\r\ndead in all periods be examined it will be found that\r\nfrom the fifth dynasty to the latest times Osiris is\r\nalways regarded as the king and god of the dead,\r\nand that Egyptian writers always assume the identity\r\nof the blessed dead with their god . Thus in the text\r\ninscribed on the Pyramid of Unas ` the writer identifies the king with the god Osiris and says to the god\r\nTem, \"0 Tem, behold thy son, this motionless Osiris,\r\n\"thou hast given him that whereon he may live. If\r\n\"he liveth this Unas liveth ; if he dieth not, this Unas\r\n\"dieth not ; if he perisheth not, this Unas perisheth not ;\r\n\"if he begetteth not, this Unas begetteth not ; if he be-\r\n\"getteth, this Unas begetteth .\" And throughout the rei . Lines 240, 241 .\r\nLXXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nligious literature the deceased always claims that whatever was done by the gods for Osiris should also be\r\ndone for him by them . The hymns addressed to Rd\r\nand other great gods dwell more on the majesty and\r\npower which they exhibit in heaven and upon earth\r\nthan upon their goodness to man ; but with Osiris\r\nthe case is different, and it is evident that in the\r\nearliest period he was regarded more in the light of a\r\ngod who could be known, and who was known more\r\nor less personally if we may use the word-and he\r\nwas of all the gods the one singled out to receive the\r\npetitions of mankind for everlasting life .\r\nIt is impossible to say when Osiris began to be\r\nregarded as the god of the dead, and it is only from\r\nbrief allusions that any history of him can be formed .\r\nThroughout the Egyptian texts it is assumed that the\r\ngod suffered death and mutilation at the hands of his\r\nenemies ; that the various members of his body were\r\nscattered about the land of Egypt ; that his sisterwife Isis sought him sorrowing and at length found\r\nhim ; that she fanned him with her wings and gave\r\nhim air ; that she raised up his body and was united\r\nunto him ; that she conceived and brought forth a\r\nchild (Horus) ; and that he (Osiris) became the god\r\nand king of the underworld . In the legend of Osiris\r\nas given by Plutarch (De Iside et Osiride) it is said\r\nthat he was murdered at the instigation of Typhon\r\nor Set, who tore the body into fourteen pieces, which\r\nhe scattered throughout the land ; Isis collected these\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION .\r\n\r\nLXXXI\r\npieces, and wherever she found one she built a tomb .\r\nAfter the death of Osiris, his son Horus did battle\r\nwith Typhon his father's murderer, and, in the words\r\nof the Egyptians, \"avenged his father\" . Notwithstanding the death and mutilation which the god suffered the Egyptians firmly believed that he rose from\r\nthe dead with a body perfect in all its members, and\r\nthat corruption and decay had no power over him .\r\nThis fact may be deduced from a large number of\r\npassages in texts of all periods, but in one in particular which forms part of Chapter CLIV of the Book\r\nof the Dead' a definite statement of it occurs . The\r\ndeceased says to Osiris, \"Do thou embalm these my\r\n\"members, for I would not perish and come to an\r\n\"end, [but would be] even like unto my divine father\r\n\"Khepera, who is the divine type of him that never\r\n\"saw corruption\tLet not my body become\r\n\"worms but deliver me as thou didst deliver thyself\r\nHomage to thee, 0 my divine father Osiris,\r\n\"thou hast thy being with thy members . Thou didst\r\n\"not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou didst\r\n\"not waste away, thou didst not become corruption,\r\n\"thou didst not putrefy, and thou didst not turn into\r\n\"worms. I am the god Khepera, and my members\r\n\"shall have an everlasting existence . I shall not decay,\r\n\"I shall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I shall not turn\r\n\"into worms, and I shall not see corruption beneath\r\ni . See infra, p . e82 f .\r\nf\r\nLXXXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"the eye of the god Shu . I shall have my being, I\r\n\"shall have my being . I shall live, I shall live . I shall\r\n\"germinate, I shall germinate, I shall germinate . I shall\r\n\"wake up in peace ; I shall not putrefy ; my intestines\r\n\"shall not perish ; I shall not suffer from any defect ;\r\n\"mine eye shall not decay ; the form of my visage\r\n\"shall not disappear ; mine ear shall not become deaf ;\r\n\"my head shall not be separated from my neck ; my\r\n\"tongue shall not be carried away ; my hair shall\r\n\"not be cut off ; mine eyebrows shall not be shaved\r\n\"off ; and no baleful injury shall come upon me . My\r\n\"body shall be stablished, and it shall neither fall\r\n\"into decay nor be destroyed upon this earth\" . The\r\noldest copy of this Chapter is inscribed upon one of\r\nthe wrappings of the mummy of Thothmes III, who\r\nreigned about B . C . i55o, and the latest is found in\r\nthe Turin Papyrus (edited by Lepsius in 1842), which\r\ndates from the Ptolemaic period . From these extracts\r\nwe see that the deceased bases his certainty of an\r\neverlasting life, which was to be lived in a body\r\nwhich was perfect in all its members, upon the assurance that Osiris died, and rose again, and lived\r\nin a body which was perfect in all its members ;\r\nand it followed for the Egyptian that if Osiris did\r\nnot die and rise again his belief in a resurrection\r\nwas vain . It is difficult to say with certainty whether\r\nthe ancient Egyptian believed that Osiris endured\r\npain and suffered death on his behalf or not ; but it\r\nis quite clear that he believed there was some very\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII\r\ndefinite connexion between the resurrection of Osiris\r\nand of himself, and also that the god was able to raise\r\nhim up and to give him everlasting life, because he\r\nhimself had conquered death and risen, and had become the master of everlasting life . If the legend of\r\nPlutarch, which states that Osiris was once a man\r\nwho lived upon earth, really represents an Egyptian\r\nbelief we may, perhaps, conclude that the manhood\r\nwhich was common to the god and to the suppliant\r\nsupplied the reason why the prayers which are put\r\ninto the mouth of the dead are always addressed to\r\nOsiris. At all events, closer personal relations existed\r\nbetween man and Osiris than between man and any\r\nother god ; moreover, for countless generations he\r\nwas the type and emblem of the resurrection, and,\r\nrelying upon his power to give immortality to man,\r\nuntold generations lived and died . The ceremonies\r\nconnected with the celebration of the sufferings, death,\r\nand resurrection of Osiris were performed with great\r\nsolemnity, and it has been thought that a representation of them took place annually in certain of his\r\nshrines.\r\nThe forms in which Osiris is depicted on the monuments and in papyri are very numerous, but we need\r\nonly refer here to those which concern him in his\r\ncharacter as king, god, and judge of the dead . In\r\npapyri he is seated on a throne within a covered\r\nshrine ; his form is that of a bearded mummy wearing the atef crown, and he holds in his hands the\r\nf*\r\nLXXXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncrook and flail (or whip), emblems of sovereignty and\r\ndominion . On the side of the throne (which rests\r\nupon a pedestal made in the form of . the symbol of that which is straight or right,) is the emblem\r\nof the union of Southern and Northern Egypt, which\r\ntypifies the sovereignty of the god over the whole\r\nland ; the throne is sometimes placed upon water,\r\nwherein we may probably see the origin-of the tradition of certain Eastern peoples which makes the\r\nthrone of the Deity to rest above running water . Behind him frequently stand the goddesses Isis and\r\nNephthys, and facing him, standing upon a lotus\r\nflower, are the four children of Horus (see p . 14) . Thus seated praise was offered to him in these\r\nwords : \"Glory be to thee, Osiris Un-nefer, the\r\n\"great god within Abydos, king of eternity, lord of\r\n\"the everlasting, who passeth through millions of\r\n\"years in his existence\" (p . i i) . \"Praise be unto thee,\r\n\"0 Osiris, lord of eternity, Un-nefer, Harmachis,\r\n\"whose forms are manifold, and whose attributes are\r\n\"majestic . . . . Those who have lain down (i. c ., the\r\n\"dead) rise up to see thee, they breathe the air and\r\n\"they look upon thy face when the disk riseth on its\r\n\"horizon ; their hearts are at peace inasmuch as they\r\n\"behold thee, 0 thou who art Eternity and Everlast-\r\n\"ingness\" (p . 34) . In an address to Osiris by Thoth\r\nwhich forms the CLXXXIInd Chapter of the Book of\r\n.the Dead (see p . 340) he is said to be the \"Governor\r\nof those who are in the underworld\", and \"to make\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXV\r\nmen and women to be born again\", the new birth\r\nbeing the birth into the life which is beyond the\r\ngrave ; and being himself everlasting he had power\r\nto bestow eternal existence upon his followers .\r\nConcerning the form in which Osiris rose from the\r\ndead the texts are silent, and nothing is said as to the\r\nnature of his body in the underworld ; that he dwelt\r\nin the material body which was his upon earth there\r\nis no reason whatever to suppose, for there are indications in the texts which point to a definite belief\r\nin the resurrection of a spiritual body, both in the\r\ncase of the god and of men . Before, however, this\r\npoint is touched upon reference must be made to the\r\nideas which the Egyptians held concerning the component parts of man's entity, material, spiritual, and\r\nmental. The physical or material body, called hhat,\r\nwas liable to decay, and could only be preserved by\r\nmummifying ; both gods and man possessed bodies of\r\nthis nature. When the material body had been brought\r\nto the tomb for burial, provided that the prescribed\r\nprayers had been said over it and the proper ceremonies had been duly performed by the priests, it\r\nacquired the power of sending forth from itself a body,\r\ncalled salnr, which was able to ascend to heaven and\r\nto dwell with the gods there . The only suitable rendering for the word shrhu is \"spiritual body\", and this\r\nmeaning fits very well into the translation of the texts\r\nwhere the word is found . The educated Egyptian\r\nnever believed that the material body would rise\r\nLXXXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nagain and take up a new life, for he well understood\r\nthat flesh and blood could not inherit immortality . It\r\nhas been urged by some that the custom of mummifying the dead, which obtained throughout Egypt for\r\nso many thousands of years, was maintained because\r\nthe Egyptian believed in the resurrection of the material body, but it is not so ; they mummified their\r\ndead simply because they believed that spiritual bodies\r\nwould \"germinate\" in them . In several places it is\r\ndistinctly said that the \"soul is in heaven, and the\r\nbody upon earth\",' and even the dead body of Osiris\r\nhimself rested upon earth in Heliopolis (see p . 290) ;\r\nelsewhere' it is said to the deceased, \"Thy soul is\r\n\"in heaven before Ra, thy KA hath what should be\r\n\"given to it with the gods, thy saxu bath power (or\r\n\"is glorious) with the KHUS, and thy body (khat) is\r\n\"stablished in the underworld It is possible\r\nthat certain simple folk may have been led to believe\r\nthat because meat offerings and drink offerings in\r\nabundance were taken to the tombs the deceased\r\nmust naturally partake of them, and it is more than\r\nprobable that the Egyptians in a semi-savage state\r\nmade such offerings because they believed them necessary for their dead .\r\nThe offerings taken to the tomb were intended for\r\nthe ka of the deceased. The word ka has formed the\r\nsubject of several learned dissertations by various schoi . Among others see Recueil de Travaux, t . IV . P . 71 (1 . 582) .\r\n2 . Lieblein, Que mon nom eurisse, p . 2, 1 . z ff. and p . 17, 1 . z ff.\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII\r\nlars, and it is now generally rendered by \"double\" ; it\r\nhas its equivalent in the Coptic nw and in the Greek\r\nE t~coX ', and in certain places may be rendered by\r\nall the meanings of these equivalents . This abstract\r\nindividuality or personality possessed all the attributes\r\nof the man himself, and, though its normal dwellingplace was in the tomb along with the body, it could\r\nwander about at will ; it was independent of the man\r\nto whom it belonged and could even go and dwell\r\nin the statue of a man . The ka could both eat and\r\ndrink, and at a very early period a small chamber\r\nwas specially prepared for it in the hall of the tomb ;\r\nthis was provided with an opening through which it\r\nmight snuff the smell of the incense and other offerings made therein, and it was the duty of certain\r\nmembers of the priesthood to minister duly and regularly to its needs . When actual offerings failed it\r\nwould seem that the ka fed upon those which were\r\npainted or sculptured upon the walls and altars in\r\nthe tomb, and when these were wanting it appears\r\nthat it might even be reduced to eating offal and\r\ndrinking filthy water .\r\nConnected in some inexplicable way with the ka\r\nwas the 6a, or soul, which according to some texts\r\nis said to eat of the funeral offerings along with the\r\nka, in whom or with whom it was supposed to dwell,\r\nbut according to others it ascended into heaven where\r\nit lived with Rd and the beatified (lead. From one\r\npoint of view it is not a material thing, and from\r\nLX XXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nanother it is a tangible thing ; it is depicted as a\r\nhuman-headed hawk, and in a Vignette in the Papyrus\r\nof Nebqet (ed . Deveria and Pierret, pl . 3) it is seen\r\nflying down the funeral pit bearing air and food to\r\nthe mummified body, lying in the mummy chamber,\r\nto which it belongs . The 6a could leave its place in\r\nheaven and visit the body whenever it pleased, and\r\nit had power to assume any form which it pleased .\r\nCertain of the characteristics of the ba were shared\r\nby the heart, rib, which was believed to be the source\r\nboth of life and of good and evil in man . The preservation of the heart was of the first importance,\r\nand several Chapters of the Book of the Dead were\r\ncomposed with the object of keeping it out of the\r\nclutches of the \"stealers of hearts\" . In the Judgment\r\nScene it is the one member of the body which is\r\nsingled out for special examination, and the large\r\nnumbers of heart amulets which are preserved in the\r\nnational collections of Egyptian antiquities testify to\r\nthe anxiety which the Egyptians felt as to its security.\r\nWith the ba, or soul, the khaibit, or shadow, is\r\noften mentioned, and it seems to have been nourished\r\nby the offerings which were made in the tomb of the\r\nman to whom it belonged . It had an existence apart\r\nfrom the body, and like the ka, or double, it could\r\nwander wherever it pleased . An interesting passage\r\nconcerning the shadow is found in the XCIInd Chapter\r\nof the Book of the Dead where the deceased prays :-\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION. LXXXIX\r\n\"0 keep not captive my soul, 0 keep not ward over\r\n\"my shadow, but let a way be opened for my soul\r\n\"and for my shadow, and let them see the Great\r\n\"God in the shrine on the day of the judgment of\r\n\"souls, and let them recite the utterances of Osiris,\r\n\"whose habitations are hidden, to those who guard\r\n\"the members of Osiris, and who keep ward over the\r\n\"Nits, and who hold captive the shadows of the dead\r\n\"who would work evil against me\" (see p . 152).\r\nAnother integral part of a man was the khu, or\r\n\"shining\", translucent covering(?) of the spiritual body,\r\nwhich dwelt in heaven with the gods . It is difficult\r\nto explain its exact relationship to the double, and\r\nthe soul, and the heart, and the shadow, but in certain passages in which the word occurs it seems as\r\nif it had some close connexion with the soul, for it\r\nis mentioned along with it .\r\nIn several passages, both in early and late texts,\r\nthe sekhem of a man is mentioned with the 6a, or\r\nsoul, and sometimes with both the ka, or double, and\r\nthe ba. One of the meanings of sekhem is \"form\" or\r\n\"statue\", but another meaning is \"power\", and it\r\nseems as if the Egyptians conceived the idea of the\r\npower or vital force of a man living, with him in\r\nheaven . The gods were supposed to possess doubles,\r\nand souls, and shadows, and hearts, and khus,\u2022 but\r\nit is doubtful if they were endowed with sekhemu ;\r\nit is probable that they were not ; many of them\r\nwere themselves sekhemnu or \"Powers\".\r\nXC\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nThere remains now but one attribute of a man to\r\nmention, and that is the ren or name ; in Egypt a\r\nman took the most extraordinary precautions to prevent his name from being blotted out, for it was the\r\ncommon belief that unless the name of a person were\r\npreserved he ceased to exist. Already in the Pyramid\r\ntexts, as Dr. Wiedemann has pointed out' we find\r\nthe deceased making supplication that his name may\r\nflourish (literally, germinate) along with the names of\r\nTem, Shu, Seb, and other gods, and the same desire\r\nis expressed in texts from the sixth dynasty down to\r\nthe Roman period, when we find that a number of\r\npapyri were inscribed with invocations to one or more\r\ngods with the sole object of making to flourish 2 the\r\nnames of those for whom they were copied . The ren,\r\nor name, had some close connexion with the ka, or\r\ndouble, as may be seen from the passage in the text\r\nof Pepi L j\r\nThus we see that the sahlt, or spiritual body, the\r\nka, or double, the ba, or soul, the ab, or heart, the\r\nNit, or shining form, the sekhem, or vital force, and\r\nthe ren, or name, and the khaibit, or shade, were all\r\nbelieved to come into existence after death, and it\r\nseems that the various parts which we have enumeri . Recueil tie Travaux, tom . XVII, p . 17 .\r\na . An interesting collection of such documents was published by Lieblein in 1895 entitled Le &re Que mon nonz fleurisse.\r\n3 . \"Pepi passeth on with his flesh, Pepi is happy with his name, Pepi\r\nliveth with his ka\" (1 . 169) .\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nXCI\r\nated together made up the spiritual body which \"germinated\" in the khal or material body . There is little\r\ndoubt that the beliefs in the existence of these various\r\nmembers of the spiritual body are not all of the same\r\nage, and they probably represent several stages of intellectual development on the part of the Egyptian ; their\r\norigin and development it is now impossible to trace,\r\nfor already in the fifth and sixth dynasties their existence is accepted as an accomplished fact .\r\nA question naturally arises at this point, as to\r\nwhen this spiritual body began its existence ; but\r\nunfortunately no satisfactory answer can at present\r\nbe given to it, for no text yet discovered supplies\r\nthe necessary information . It is natural to suppose\r\nthat the sdh-it, or spiritual body, came into being as\r\na result of the prayers which were recited on the\r\nday of the burial of the mummified body, and of the\r\nceremonies which were performed at the same time .\r\nOn the other hand, there exist distinct proofs that\r\nthe Egyptians believed in a judgment which was to\r\nbe held in the domain of Osiris, and we should hardly\r\nexpect the spiritual body to begin its career until\r\nafter the trial of the heart in the Balance, and until\r\nthe verdict of the gods at this Judgment was favourable to the deceased . The whole question is full of\r\ndifficulty, chiefly because the Egyptians themselves\r\ndid not, I imagine, form definite ideas on such subjects, or if they did, they did not put them in writing. It is, however, perfectly certain that they be-\r\nXCII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nlieved that Osiris had the power to make men to\r\nbe born after death into a new life, and that such\r\nlife was everlasting ; and they ascribed to him this\r\npower because he had himself suffered death and\r\nmutilation and had risen from the dead .\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\nAn examination of the papyri inscribed with the\r\nTheban Recension of the Book of the Dead shews\r\nthat they may be divided into two classes, viz., (1)\r\nthose in which the Chapters of Coming forth by Day\r\nare preceded by Introductory Hymns to Rd and Osiris,\r\nand by a Judgment Scene, and (2) those in which they\r\nare preceded by a simple Vignette in which the god\r\nOsiris is seen seated within a shrine . The oldest papyri of the eighteenth dynasty' lack such Introductory\r\nHymns and the Judgment Scene, which appear most\r\noften in the illuminated papyri of the last half of the\r\neighteenth dynasty ; they continue in the nineteenth\r\ndynasty, but frequently in a less full form . In the\r\nolder Recensions of the Book of the Dead there is no\r\nattempt to describe the judgment pictorially, and although it is pretty certain that every Egyptian believed\r\nthat he would be judged after death, there is no definite statement of the fact . It will be noticed that a\r\ni . E. g., the Papyrus of Nebseni and the Papyrus of Nu .\r\nXC I V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nsection of Chapter XXX B contains the words, \"My\r\n\"heart, my mother ; my heart, my mother! My heart\r\n\"whereby I came into being! May naught stand up to\r\n\"oppose me at my judgment ; may there be no opposition to me in the presence of the sovereign princes\r\n\"[of Osiris] ; may there be no parting of thee from\r\n\"me in the presence of him that keepeth the Balance\"\r\n(see p. 79) . \"Let there be joy of heart unto us at the\r\n\"weighing of words . Let not that which is false be\r\n\"uttered against me before the great god, the lord\r\n\"of Amentet\" (see p . 80). Here clearly we have suggested the idea of weighing the heart, as the symbol\r\nof the seat of life and the source of good and evil\r\nactions, and as a matter of fact the Vignette of the\r\nChapter, which first appears in the eighteenth dynasty, represents the deceased sitting in one pan of\r\nthe scales and being weighed against his heart which\r\nis placed in the other . It is not easy to say exactly\r\nwhat belief underlies this Vignette, but it seems to\r\nindicate that the guardian of the scale weighed the\r\nbody to see if it had carried out properly the heart's\r\ndirections, and that if it had done so it would counterbalance exactly the heart, and the beam of the scales\r\nwould be straight . This testing of the body or heart,\r\nor both, took place in the presence of Osiris on the\r\nday when \"words were weighed\" .\r\nIn the Papyrus of Ani (sheet 3 i) four small Vignettes accompany the Negative Confession, which\r\nforms part of the CXXVth Chapter, and in one of\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nXCV\r\nthese we see the heart of the deceased in one pan\r\nof the balance, and a feather, emblematic of Right\r\nand Truth, i . e ., \"what is straight\", in the other. The\r\ngod Anubis is testing the tongue of the balance, and\r\nclose by stands the monster Am-met or \"eater of the\r\ndead\" . Here we have a proof that in addition to the\r\nweighing of a man's body against his heart, the heart\r\nitself was weighed against Right and Truth, and that\r\nthis stage of the judgment also took place in the\r\npresence of the god Osiris, the judge of the dead .\r\nIn the eighteenth dynasty, if not earlier, the idea of\r\nthe judgment took great hold upon the minds of the\r\nEgyptians, and it found expression in the large and\r\nelaborate Vignette which is prefixed to the copies of\r\nthe Chapters of Coming Forth by Day which were\r\nmade at this period ; it is, however, impossible to\r\nsay whether the large Vignette is a development of\r\nthat which accompanies the CXXVth Chapter, or\r\nwhether each had a distinct origin . When once the\r\nidea of the great judgment Scene had developed itself\r\nit seems to have been felt that the deceased ought\r\nnot to enter into the Hall of judgment without having\r\nfirst uttered words of prayer and praise to the great\r\ngods Rat and Osiris, to the former as the greatest of\r\nthe cosmic gods, and to the latter as the judge and\r\ngod of the dead ; hence were composed the Introductory Hymns to Ra and Osiris, of which several\r\nexamples are known.\r\nIn the hymns to Ra the deceased apostrophizes\r\nXC V I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe glory and majesty of the One god, the creator\r\nof the world and all that therein is, who manifests\r\nhimself to his creatures under the form of the sun,\r\nby whose heat and light men and women, beasts and\r\nfeathered fowl, fish and creeping things, trees and\r\nherbs have their being . The darkness of night into\r\nwhich the sun disappeared when he set was personified as an enemy of the sun, and the daily victory\r\nof light over darkness was hymned with gladness by\r\nhis worshippers . From one point of view the Egyptian regarded the course of the sun as a type of his\r\nown life, and day symbolized life and night death ;\r\nthe conflict in which the sun engaged with the powers\r\nof darkness typified the struggle of the deceased with\r\nhis enemies in the underworld, and man hoped that\r\nhe would overcome them even as the sun vanquished\r\nall who opposed his course . In a fine hymn (see p . io)\r\nthe deceased says :- \"O thou beautiful Being, thou\r\n\"dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of the\r\n\"Disk within thy mother Hathor ; therefore in every\r\n\"place every heart swelleth with joy at thy rising\r\n\"eternally\t0 Ra, the divine man-child, the heir\r\n\"of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, prince of the\r\n\"Tuat, governor of the regions of Aukert, . . . thou\r\n\"god of life, thou lord of love, all men live when\r\n\"thou shinest ; thou art crowned king of the gods .\r\n\"Those who are in thy following sing unto thee with\r\n\"joy and bow down their foreheads to the earth\r\n\"when they meet thee, thou lord of heaven, thou lord\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nXC\\'II\r\n\"of earth, thou king of Right and Truth, thou lord\r\n\"of eternity, thou prince of everlastingness, thou sovereign of all the gods, thou god of life, thou creator of eternity, thou maker of heaven wherein thou\r\n\"art firmly established .

The Serpent-fiend (i. e ., Darkness)\r\n\"hath fallen, his arms are hewn off, the knife hath\r\n\"cut asunder his joints . Ra liveth in unchanging and\r\n\"eternal law and order.\" Again, in another hymn\r\n(see p . 8) we read :- \"Thou risest, thou risest, thou\r\n\"shinest, thou shinest, thou art crowned king of the\r\n\"gods . Thou art the lord of heaven, thou art the lord\r\n\"of earth ; thou art the creator of beings celestial and\r\n\"of beings terrestrial .

Thou art crowned\r\n\"Prince of heaven, thou art the One dowered [with\r\n\"all sovereignty] who comest forth from the sky .

Millions of years\r\n\"have gone over the world ; I cannot tell the number of those through which thou hast passed .\" From\r\nthese passages it is clear that the Egyptians believed\r\nthat the god who was typified by the sun was eternal, immortal, and unknown (i . invisible), that he\r\ncreated himself, and the world, and the beings and\r\nthings in it ; he was also One and Alone, and there\r\nwas none like unto him, for the gods, of whom he\r\nwas king, only possessed certain of his attributes and\r\ncharacteristics . It has been denied by some that his\r\noneness or unity is the same as the unity of God\r\nAlmighty, though I believe there is no good reason\r\nfor this view ; but whether it be or not it is perfectly certain that when the Egyptians declared that\r\ntheir god was One they meant exactly what the Hebrews meant when they declared that Jehovah was\r\nOne,' and what the Arabs meant, and still mean when\r\ni . \"Hear, 0 Israel, Adonai our God is God One\" (\u201E;.) Deuteronomy VI. 4 .\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nXCIX\r\nthey cry out that Allah is One .' At all events the\r\nOne god of the Egyptians possessed all the essential\r\nattributes of the Christian's God .\r\nIn the hymns to Osiris the deceased enumerates\r\nthe various titles of the god and mentions his most\r\nancient shrines. Osiris is declared to be the son of\r\nSeb, the earth-god, and of Nut, the sky-goddess, and\r\n\"as prince of gods and men\" to have \"received the\r\ncrook, and the whip, and the dignity of his divine\r\nfathers\" ; he is the king of eternity and lord of everlastingness, and his existence is for millions of years .\r\nIn his name \"Osiris\" he is most terrible, and he endureth for ever in his name \"Un-nefer\". Though\r\npossessing the attribute of eternal which is ascribed\r\nto Rd he is not \"self-begotten and self-born\" like that\r\ngod ; Ra has no offspring in the human sense of the\r\nword, but Osiris begot a son (after his death, according to one legend), who succeeded to his father's\r\nthrone upon earth and \"avenged\" him on Set his\r\nmurderer. From Ra the deceased asks only that he\r\nmay behold him \"at dawn each day\" (see p . 9), but\r\nfrom Osiris he asks (see p . I2) that his ka, or double,\r\nmay have \"splendour in heaven, and might upon\r\nearth, and triumph in the underworld\". And he adds,\r\n\"May I sail down to Tattu (Mendes or Busiris) like\r\n\"a living soul and up to Abtu (Abydos) like a Bciriru\r\ni . \"He God is One ( awl d,1Jl .n) ; the eternal God ; he begetteth not,\r\nneither is he begotten ; and there is not any one like unto him\" .

The Vignette\r\nof the Judgment Scene varies in detail greatly in the\r\nvarious papyri, though the essential parts of it are always preserved ; the fullest form known of it is given\r\nin the Papyrus of Ani and may be thus described :-\r\nIn one portion of a chamber in the domain of Osiris,\r\nwhich we may assume to be the Hall of the Double\r\nMaat, or Right and Truth, a balance is set wherein\r\nthe heart of the deceased is to be weighed ; the beam\r\nof the balance is suspended upon a projection from the\r\nstandard made in the form of the feather which symbolizes Right and Truth . Upon the beam of the balance sits the dog-headed ape which was associated\r\nwith Thoth, the scribe of the gods. The weighing of\r\nthe heart is carried out in the presence of the company of the gods, which is here represented by the\r\nfollowing members of it :-\r\ni . Ra-Heru-Khuti, or Ra-I-Iarmachis, the great god\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCl\r\nwithin his boat . This boat was called the \"Bark of\r\nmillions of years\", and there sat in it along with Ra\r\nthe gods Khepera and Tem, his own forms in the\r\nmorning and evening respectively .\r\n2 . Temu or Tem, the form of Ra at eventide . He\r\nwas the head of the company of gods at Heliopolis,\r\nand is always represented in human form. This fact\r\nindicates that already in the earliest times known to\r\nus he had gone through all the various stages through\r\nwhich gods pass and had assumed a final and definite form .\r\n3 . Shu, the son of Ra and IIathor, who lifted up\r\nthe goddess Nut, or the sky, from the embrace of Seb\r\nthe earth-god ; he typified the light .\r\n4.

Isis, the sister-wife of Osiris and mother of\r\n\"Horns son of Isis\" ; she probably typified the dawn .\r\n8. Nephthys, daughter of Seb and Nut, sister of\r\nOsiris and Isis, and the sister-wife of Set ; she is also\r\nsaid to be the mother of Anubis by Osiris ; she probably typified eventide or twilight .\r\nC11\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n9 . Horus, the sun-god, who is to be distinguished\r\nfrom Horus the son of Isis . He is represented in\r\nhuman form but with the head of a hawk ; the hawk\r\nwas the symbol of Horns, and the worship of that\r\nbird is probably the oldest in Egypt .\r\nio. Hathor, the goddess of that portion of the sky\r\nwherein Horns the sun-god rose and set .\r\ni i . Hu and Sa, two gods who had their places in\r\nthe boat of the sun at creation .\r\nIt will be noticed that several of the gods, e .g.,\r\nNu, Ptah, Khnemu, Khepera, Set, Anpu, Ap-uat,\r\nAmsu, Hapi, and several goddesses, c . r., Madt, Nit,\r\nSekhet, Bast, Serq, Uatchit,' are not here represented ; the explanation of this fact is that only the gods\r\nand the goddesses of the funeral company of Osiris\r\nare considered to be interested in the judgment of\r\nthe dead.\r\nOn one side of the scale we see the god Anubis\r\ntesting the tongue of the balance, and behind him\r\nstand Thoth, the scribe of the gods, writing down\r\nthe result of the weighing, and the tri-formed 2 beast\r\nAm-mit, the \"Eater of the Dead\", who is waiting to\r\ndevour the heart of Ani should it be found light in\r\nthe balance . On the other side of the balance are\r\nAni's \"luck\" or \"destiny\" ; an object called zzzesk\/zen\r\nwhich has been described as a \"cubit with human\r\ni .

Behind these stand Ani himself and his wife\r\nThuthu with heads reverently bent . Ani is here depicted in human form, and wearing garments and\r\nornaments similar to those which he wore upon earth .\r\nIt is quite clear that the body which he has in this\r\nHall of judgment cannot be the body with which he\r\nhad been endowed upon earth, and we are probably\r\nto understand that it is his spiritual body, wearing the\r\nwhite robes of the beatified dead in the world beyond\r\nthe grave, which we see . He is perfect in all his\r\nmembers, which are endowed with the strength and\r\npower that belong to those who have risen in a spiritual or glorified body from the dead . Though he\r\nstands at the entrance of the Hall and the weighing\r\nof the heart has not yet taken place, the artist depicted him in the form in which it was always assumed\r\nthe just would appear before Osiris . The heart having\r\nbeen placed in one pan of the scales and the feather,\r\nsymbolic of truth, in the other, Ani utters the words\r\nwhich form Chapter XXX ii of the Book of the Dead\r\n(see p . i9) wherein he prays that there may be no\r\nparting of his heart from him in the presence of the\r\nguardian of the Balance . This done, Anubis tests the\r\ntongue of the balance, and finds that the beam is\r\nC I V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nexactly straight and that the heart balances the feather exactly ; the dog-headed ape seated on the standard reports this to Thoth, who, standing with his\r\nwriting-reed in hand, is ready to note the result and\r\nto declare it to the gods . It is interesting to observe\r\nthat the heart was only required to balance the feather and not to outweigh it, a fact which indicates\r\nthat the pious Egyptian was supposed to be able to\r\nsatisfy the demands and requirements of the law, and\r\nthat he took his stand in the judgment and hoped\r\nfor acquittal by virtue of the good deeds which he\r\nhad done in the body .\r\nThe god Thoth next addressed the company of the\r\ngods as follows : \"Hear ye this judgment. The heart\r\n\"of Osiris hath in very truth been weighed, and his\r\n\"soul bath stood as a witness for him ; it bath been\r\n\"found true by trial in the Great Balance . There hath\r\n\"not been found any wickedness in him ; he bath not\r\n\"wasted the offerings in the temples ; he hath not\r\n\"done harm by his deeds ; and he spread no evil\r\n`reports [about men] while he was upon earth .\" To\r\nthis speech the gods reply : \"That which cometh forth\r\n\"from thy mouth [0 Thoth, dwelling in Khemennu,]\r\n\"is confirmed. Osiris, the scribe Ani, is holy and\r\n`\u00B0righteous. He hath not sinned, neither bath he done\r\n\"evil against us . The devourer A .memet shall not be\r\n\"allowed to prevail over him, and meat-offerings and\r\n\"entrance into the presence of the god Osiris shall\r\n\"be granted unto him, together with a homestead for\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nCV\r\n\"ever in Sekhet-hetepu, as unto the followers of\r\n\"Horus.\" '\r\nThe gods confirm the report of Thoth, and Ani,\r\nhaving been found just, is led into the presence of\r\nOsiris by \"Horus the son of Isis\" . The words \"found\r\njust\" represent in a measure the words ntaa khef-u\r\n(masc.) or uncut khcrtt (fem .) which are always added\r\nafter the name of the deceased in funeral texts ; there\r\nis no example of their application to a living person .\r\nMuch has been written about them, and many renderings have been suggested for them, such as \"true\r\nof voice\", \"justified\", \"triumphant\", \"victorious\" ; they\r\nactually mean \"right\" (itaa) and \"word\" (cheru), and\r\nseem to be meant to express the belief on the part\r\nof the writer that the deceased has satisfactorily passed\r\nthe ordeal of judgment, and that he has attained to\r\nthe state in which his commands, whatever they may\r\nbe, will be carried out duly and effectually .\r\nWhile Horus is leading Ani into the presence of\r\nhis father he addresses Osiris, saying, \"I have come\r\n\"unto thee, 0 Un-nefer, and I have brought the Osiris\r\n\"Ani unto thee . His heart hath been [found] righteous coming forth from the balance, and it hath not\r\n\"sinned against any god or goddess. Thoth hath\r\n\"weighed it according to the decree uttered unto\r\ni . The Heru-shesu, or followers of Horus, are a class of mythological\r\nbeings or demi-gods who already in the Pyramid Texts are supposed to\r\nrecite prayers on behalf of the deceased, and to assist Horus and Set in\r\n\"opening his mouth\" . For a description of this ceremony, see my Papyrus\r\nof An i, p . 26, f.\r\nC V I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"him by the company of the gods ; and it is very true\r\n\"and righteous. Grant unto him cakes and ale ; and\r\n\"let him enter into the presence of Osiris (1. e ., into\r\n\"thy presence) ; and may he be like unto the fol-\r\n\"lowers of Horns for ever .\" In the last division of\r\nthe Judgment Scene we see Ani kneeling by a table\r\nof offerings placed before the shrine of the god Osiris,\r\nto whom he says, \"0 lord of Amentet, I am in thy\r\n\"presence . There is no sin in me, I have not lied\r\n\"wittingly, nor have I (lone au-ht with a false heart .\r\n\"Grant that I may be like unto those favoured ones\r\n\"who are round about thee, and that I may be an\r\n\"Osiris greatly favoured of the beautiful god and be-\r\n\"loved of the lord of the world, [I] the royal scribe\r\n\"indeed, who loveth him, Ani, triumphant before the\r\n\"god Osiris .\" It will be noticed that Ani now has\r\nhis hair whitened, and that he wears upon his head\r\nthe object which is called a cone, the signification of\r\nwhich is unknown . He has at length penetrated to\r\nthe throne of \"Osiris, the lord of eternity''-as the\r\nwords written above him read and Ani's petition to\r\nthe god is that he may become \"an Osiris\", that is\r\nto say, a being endowed with a spiritual body which\r\ncan never again see death or suffer corruption . The\r\nanswer of Osiris is not given in the papyrus, nor is\r\nit, as far as I have seen, in any papyrus where a\r\nsimilar petition is made ; but just as it is always assumed that the heart of the deceased will always balance the feather of law or right and truth, so is it also\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nCVII\r\nassumed that the petition of the deceased will always\r\nbe favourably received, and that he will henceforth\r\nbe free to go about in the god's domains without\r\nlet or hindrance, and to participate in all the occupations of the great god himself. Thus the Judgment\r\nScene ends, and this section of the papyrus in which\r\nit is found is followed by the \"Chapters of Coming\r\nForth by Day\" .\r\nThe question naturally arises here : When did the\r\njudgment in the Hall of Osiris take place ? To this\r\nno definite answer can be given, for the reason that\r\nno text supplies the information needed . There are\r\nno grounds, so far as I see, for assuming that the\r\nEgyptians believed in a great general day of judgment when all the world shall be judged, and the\r\nwicked shall be punished, and the righteous shall be\r\nrewarded, or for thinking, as some have done, that\r\nthe mummified bodies were laid in the tomb to await\r\na general resurrection . On the contrary, all the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the judgment of each individual was thought to take place\r\nimmediately after death, and if this was the belief it\r\nfollows that punishment or reward was allotted to\r\nthe dead at once . The evil heart, . or the heart which\r\nhad failed to balance the feather symbolic of the law,\r\nwas given to the monster Am-mit to devour ; thus\r\npunishment consisted of instant annihilation, unless we\r\nimagine that the destruction of the heart was extended\r\nover an indefinite period . The difficulty of the sub-\r\nC V I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nject is further complicated when we come to consider\r\nthe use and object of the funeral ceremonies and\r\nprayers . If at his death the soul of a man passed\r\nto immediate judgment, what could the ceremonies\r\nand prayers of the priests avail it? We know that\r\nthe embalming of a body in the best and most expensive way occupied a period varying from seventy\r\nto about one hundred days, and that several more\r\ndays were necessary before the body was coffined\r\nand laid with the proper ceremonies in the tomb . If\r\nthe prayers which the priests recited and the ceremonies which they performed over it at the grave\r\nwere absolutely necessary for the future well-being\r\nof its soul, and if the soul could not begin its beatified existence until such prayers had been said and\r\nsuch ceremonies had been performed, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why such a lengthy process of embalmment was resorted to, for during the period which\r\nelapsed between death and burial the soul must have\r\ntarried in some intermediate place . In the absence\r\nof exact knowledge we can only assume that certain\r\nprayers were said for the benefit of the deceased immediately after death, and that such prayers assured\r\nhis acquittal in the Hall of Osiris, and procured for\r\nhim entrance into the abode of the blessed . This done,\r\nthe embalmment of the body might be carried out\r\nat the convenience of all concerned, and the elaborate and formal ceremonies connected with the sepulture of the great would follow in due course . The\r\nTHE JUDGMENT F THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCIX\r\nbeliefs which are connected with the judgment of the\r\ndead are so numerous and so conflicting, and belong\r\nto so many various periods of development of religious thought in Egypt that it is impossible to harmonize them ; as new nexts are discovered the difficulties will probably disappear one by one, and the\r\nfuture labours of Egyptologists will clear up many\r\nobscure passages which up to the present have been\r\nmisunderstood .\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN.\r\nAt a very early period in their history the Egyptians believed in the existence of a place wherein\r\nthe blessed dead led a life of happiness, the characteristics of which much resemble those of the life\r\nwhich he had led upon earth ; these characteristics\r\nare so similar that it is hard to believe that in the\r\nearly times the one life was not held to be a mere\r\ncontinuation of the other . At all events the delights and pleasures of this world were believed to\r\nbe forthcoming in the next, and a life there in a\r\nstate of happiness which depended absolutely upon\r\nmaterial things was contemplated . Such ideas date\r\nfrom the time when the Egyptians were in a semisavage state, and the preservation of them is probably due to their extreme conservatism in all matters connected with religion ; the remarkable point\r\nabout them is their persistence, for they occur in\r\ntexts which belong to periods when it was impossible\r\nfor the Egyptians to have attached any serious importance to them, and some of the coarsest ideas\r\nTHE EL YSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN\r\n\r\nCXI\r\nare in places mingled with the expression of lofty\r\nspiritual conceptions . In a passage in the text of\r\nUnas it is said of this king (1 . 623), \"Unas hath come\r\n\"to his pools which are on both sides of the stream\r\n\"of the goddess Meht-urt, and to the place of verdant offerings, and to the fields which are on the\r\n`horizon ; he hath made his fields on both sides of\r\n\"the horizon to be verdant . He hath brought the\r\n\"crystal to the Great Eye which is in the field, he\r\n\"hath taken his seat in the horizon, he riseth like\r\n\"Sebek the son of Neith, he eateth with his mouth,\r\n\"he voideth water, he enjoyeth the pleasures of love,\r\n\"and he is the begetter who carrieth away women\r\n\"from their husbands whenever it pleaseth him so to\r\n\"do\". And in the text of Teta (1 . 286f.) we read,\r\n\"Hail, Osiris Teta, Horus hath granted that Thoth\r\n\"shall bring thine enemy unto thee . He hath placed\r\n\"thee behind him that he may riot harm thee and\r\n\"that thou mayest make thy seat upon him, and that\r\n\"when coming forth thou mayest sit upon him so that\r\n\"he may not be able to force intercourse upon thee\" .\r\nThese passages give a very clear idea of the state\r\nof Egyptian morals when they were written, and they\r\nindicate the indignities to which those vanquished in\r\nwar, both male and female, were exposed at the\r\nhands of the conquerors .\r\nThe texts of the early period, as will be seen from\r\nthe extracts given further on, give a large amount\r\nof information about the pleasures of the deceased in\r\nC X I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe world beyond the grave, but no attempt to illustrate the employments of the blessed dead is given\r\nuntil the eighteenth dynasty, when the Vignette to\r\nthe CXth Chapter of the Book of the Dead was inserted in papyri . Here we have an idea given of the\r\nconception which the Egyptian formed of the place\r\n,,, herein he was to dwell after death . A homestead\r\nor farm, or country, intersected with canals is at\r\nonce his paradise and the home of the blessed dead,\r\nand the abode of the god of his city. This place is\r\ncalled Sekhet -Aaru or \"Field of Reeds\", and this\r\nname seems to indicate that the Egyptian placed his\r\nparadise in the north of Egypt, probably in some part\r\nof the Delta or in the islands of the sea still further\r\nnorth . Certain it is that the deceased prays several\r\ntimes that the \"sweet breath of the north wind\" may\r\nbe given unto him, and those who have experienced\r\nthe discomfort of a south wind on a hot day in\r\nEgypt will sympathize with him . The Field of Reeds,\r\nhowever, was but a portion of the district called\r\n\"Sekhet-Hetep\" or \"Sekhet-Hetepet\", or \"Fields of\r\nPeace\", over which there presided a number of gods,\r\nand here the deceased led a life which suggests that\r\nthe idea of the whole place originated with a nation\r\nof agriculturists . In the coloured Vignette which faces\r\nChapter CX (see p . 170) the scribe Ani is seen being\r\nintroduced to the gods of Sekhet-hetep by Thoth,\r\nwho accompanies him to smooth his way and to do\r\nfor him all that he did for Osiris . Next we see him\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEA VEN.\r\n\r\nCXIII\r\nsailing in a boat laden with offerings which he is\r\nbearing to the hawk-god . Lower down we see him\r\nreaping wheat and driving the oxen which tread out the\r\ncorn, and beyond that he is kneeling before two heaps\r\nof grain, one red and one white . In the next division\r\nhe is ploughing the land of Sekhet-Anru or SekhetAaru by the side of a stream of vast length and unknown breadth, which contains neither worm nor fish .\r\nIn the fourth division is the abode of the god Osiris,\r\nand here are the places where dwell those who are\r\nnourished upon divine food, and the spiritual bodies\r\nof the dead. In one section of this division the deceased placed the god of his city, so that even in\r\nrespect of his religious observances his life might be\r\nas perfect as it was upon earth . His wishes in the\r\nmatter of the future life are well expressed in the\r\nfollowing prayer (see p . 172) :--\"Let me be rewarded with thy fields, 0 god Hetep ; that which is\r\n\"thy wish shalt thou do, 0 lord of the winds . May\r\n\"I become a Khu therein, may I eat therein, may I\r\n\"drink therein, may I plough therein, may I reap\r\n\"therein, may I fight therein, may I make love therein,\r\n\"may my words be mighty therein, may I never be\r\n\"\"in a state of servitude therein, but may I have authority therein.\" Elsewhere in the same Chapter the\r\ndeceased addresses the gods of the various lakes and\r\nsections of the Elysian Fields, and he states that he\r\nhas bathed in the holy lake, that all uncleanness has\r\ndeparted from him, and that he has arrayed himself\r\nh\r\nCXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nin the apparel of Ra ; in his new life even amusements are provided (but they are the amusements of\r\nearth), for he snares feathered fowl and sails about\r\nin his boat catching worms and serpents . A remarkable passage in the text of Unas (1 . 496 ff.) describes\r\nthe deceased king as a soul in the form of a god\r\nwho devours his fathers and mothers, and -mankind\r\ngenerally, and gods . He hunts and entraps the gods\r\nin the plains of the next world, and having tied them\r\nsecurely he slays and disembowels them . The choice\r\nportions of their bodies he boils and consumes at his\r\nmeals at dawn, eventide, and midnight ; the remainder\r\nhe burns to heat the cauldrons . He eats the hearts\r\ncarefully so that he may absorb the vital powers of\r\nthe gods, and by eating other portions also he acquires all the attributes of the god . Inasmuch as he\r\nhas eaten the bodies of the gods he becomes indeed\r\na god, and since they possessed the attribute of everlasting life and could not die again, the king becomes\r\nstraightway possessed of their attributes . Here again\r\nwe have a trace of a savage custom, namely that of\r\ncutting out a portion of some intestine of a foe and\r\neating it in order to acquire his mental and physical\r\npowers ; such a custom must have disappeared from\r\nEgypt long before the monuments known to us were\r\nmade, and it is hard to understand the retention of such\r\na notion in a text filled with sublime thoughts and ideas.\r\nIn the texts of all periods we read often that the\r\ndeceased lives with Ra, that he stands among the\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN.\r\n\r\nCXV\r\ncompany of the gods, and that he is one like unto\r\nthe divine beings who dwell with them ; but little is\r\ntold us concerning his intercourse with those whom\r\nhe has known upon earth, and if it were not for some\r\ntwo or three passages in the Theban Recension of\r\nthe Book of the Dead we should be obliged to assume that the power to recognize the friends of earth\r\nin the next world was not enjoyed by the deceased .\r\nBut that he really possessed this power, at least so\r\nfar as his parents were concerned, we learn from the\r\nCXth Chapter, where the deceased, addressing a pool\r\nor lake situated in the first section of the Elysian\r\nFields, says (see p . 175), \"0 Qenqentet, I have en-\r\n\"tered into thee, and I have seen the Osiris [my\r\n\"father], and I have identified my mother,\" a delight,\r\nhowever, which he brackets with the pleasures of making love and of catching worms and serpents! In the\r\npapyrus of the priestess Anhai (Brit . Mus . No. ro ;472)\r\nwe actually see the deceased lady in converse with\r\ntwo figures, one of whom is probably her father and\r\nthe other certainly her mother, for above the head of\r\nthe latter are written the words \"her mother\" (i maut- s)\r\nfollowed by the name . A supplementary proof of this\r\nis afforded by a passage in the LIInd Chapter, where\r\nthe deceased says (see p . io3) :- \"The gods shall\r\n\"say unto me : `What manner of food wouldst thou\r\n\"'have given unto thee ?' [And I reply :] 'Let me eat\r\n\" `my food under the sycamore tree of my lady, the\r\n\"'goddess Hathor, and let my times be among the\r\nh*\r\nCXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n`divine beings who have alighted thereon. Let me\r\n-have the power to order my own fields in Tattu\r\n\" `and my own growing crops in Annu. Let me live\r\n\"`upon bread made of white barley, and let my ale\r\n-be [made] from red grain, and may the persons of\r\n\"`my father and my mother be given unto me as\r\n\" `guardians of my door and for the ordering of my\r\n\"'territory .'\" The same idea is also expressed in the\r\nCLXXXIXth Chapter (1 . 7) . Thus the deceased hoped\r\nto have in the next world an abundance of the material comforts which he enjoyed in this world, and to\r\nmeet again his own god, and his father and mother ;\r\nas we see him frequently accompanied by his wife in\r\nseveral Vignettes to other Chapters we may assume\r\nthat he would meet her again along with the children\r\nwhom she bore him .\r\nIt will be noticed that little is said throughout the\r\nBook of the Dead about the spiritual occupations of\r\nthe blessed dead, and we are told nothing of the\r\nchoirs of angels who hymn the Deity everlastingly in\r\nthe religious works of later Western nations . The\r\ndead who attained to everlasting life became in every\r\nrespect like the divine inhabitants of heaven, and they\r\nate the same meat, and drank the same drink, and\r\nwore the same apparel, and lived as they lived . No\r\nclassification of angels is mentioned, and grades of\r\nthem like Cherubim, and Seraphim, Thrones, Powers,\r\nDominions, etc ., such as are found in the celestial hierarchy of Semitic nations are unknown ; a celestial city\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN .\r\n\r\nCXVII\r\nconstructed on the model described in the Apocalypse\r\nis also unknown .\r\nWe have seen that the Elysian Fields much resembled\r\nthe flat, fertile lands intersected by large canals and\r\nstreams of running water such as must always have\r\nexisted, and may still be seen in certain parts of the\r\nDelta ; of the distance to be traversed by the dead before they were reached nothing whatever is said. As\r\nthe Egyptian made his future world a counterpart of\r\nthe Egypt which he knew and loved, and gave to it\r\nheavenly counterparts of all the sacred cities thereof,\r\nhe must have conceived the existence of a water way\r\nlike the Nile, with tributaries and branches, whereon\r\nhe might sail and perform his journeys . According to\r\nsome texts the abode of the dead was away beyond\r\nEgypt to the north, but according to others it might be\r\neither above or below the earth . The oldest tradition\r\nof all placed it above the earth, and the sky was the\r\nlarge flat or vaulted iron surface which formed its floor ;\r\nthis iron surface was supported upon four pillars, one\r\nat each of the cardinal points, and its edges were some\r\nheight above the earth . To reach this iron ceiling of\r\nthe earth and floor of heaven a ladder was thought to\r\nbe necessary, as we may see from the following passage in which Pepi the king says, \"Homage to thee,\r\n\"O ladder' of the god, homage to thee, 0 ladder of Set .\r\n\"Set thyself up, 0 ladder of the god, set thyself up,\r\ni . J ~\r\n4\r\nmagel (Pepi I, 1 . 192) .\r\nC XV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"0 ladder of Set, set thyself up, 0 ladder of Horus,\r\n\"whereby Osiris appeared in heaven when he wrought\r\n\"protection for Ra\tFor it is thy son Pepi, and\r\n\"this Pepi is Horus, and thou hast given birth to this\r\n\"Pepi even as thou halt given birth to the god who is\r\n\"the lord of the ladder. Thou hast given unto him the\r\n\"ladder of the god, and thou hast given unto him the\r\n\"ladder of Set, whereby this Pepi hath appeared in\r\n\"heaven, when he wrought protection for Ra .\" And\r\nin another place (1. 182) we read, \"Pepi goeth to his\r\n\"mother Nut there (i. c ., in heaven), and he entereth\r\n\"therein in his name of `Ladder' .\" Elsewhere we are\r\ntold that (1 . 16q) :- \"Pepi is holy . He hath received\r\n\"his staff, he is provided with his throne, and he hath\r\n\"taken his seat in the boat of the double company of\r\n\"the gods. Ra acteth as his pilot in his journey to\r\n\"the West, and he stablisheth his throne for him at\r\n\"the head of the lords of Kas, and he hath inscribed\r\n\"[his name] at the head of the living . The Peh-ka\r\n\"which is in the waters openeth its doors to this Pepi,\r\n\"and the iron [which formeth] the ceiling of the heavens\r\n\"unbolteth its gates to this Pepi ; Pepi passeth through\r\n\"them having his panther skin upon him, and his whip\r\n\"in his hand .\"\r\nA later belief placed the abode of the departed away\r\nto the west or north-west of Egypt, and the souls of\r\nthe dead made their way thither through a gap in the\r\nmountains on the western bank of the Nile near Abydos. A still later belief made out that the abode of the\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEA VEN.\r\n\r\nCXIX\r\ndeparted was a long, mountainous, narrow valley with\r\na river running along it ; starting from the east it made\r\nits way to the north, and then taking a circular direction it came back to the east . In this valley there lived\r\nall manner of fearful monsters and beasts, and here\r\nwas the country through which the sun passed during\r\nthe twelve hours of night .' It is impossible to reconcile all the conflicting statements concerning the abode\r\nof the dead, and the Egyptians themselves held different views about it at different periods . The following\r\nextracts, however, from the Pyramid Texts 2 will shew\r\nthe reader what views were held by them concerning\r\nthe home of the blessed dead in the next world, and\r\nconcerning their treatment therein by the gods .\r\n(L. 468) \"Behold Unas, cometh, behold, Unas cometh,\r\n\"behold, Unas cometh forth! And if Unas cometh not of\r\n\"his own accord thy message having come to him shall\r\n\"bring him . Unas maketh his way to his abode, and\r\n\"the cow-goddess of the Great Lake boweth down be-\r\n\"fore him ; none shall ever take away his food from\r\n\"the Great Boat, and he shall not be repulsed at the\r\n\"White House of the great ones by the region Mes-\r\n\"khent on the border of the sky .

The formulae consisted of the repetition of\r\nthe names of gods and supernatural beings, benevolent or hostile to man as the case might be, and\r\nof entreaties or curses ; the ceremonies were of various\r\nkinds, and the object of the present chapter is to describe briefly those which relate to the various sections of the Book of the Dead .\r\nThe Egyptian believed that every word spoken\r\nunder certain circumstances must be followed by some\r\neffect, good or bad ; a prayer uttered by a properly\r\nqualified person, or by a man ceremonially pure, in\r\nthe proper place, and in the proper manner, must\r\nnecessarily be answered favourably ; and similarly\r\nthe curses which were pronounced upon a man, or\r\nbeast, or thing, in the name of a hostile supernatural\r\ni*\r\nCXLV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION . being were bound to result in harm to the object\r\ncursed . It seems that this idea had its origin in the\r\nbelief that the world and all that therein is came\r\ninto being immediately after Thoth had interpreted in\r\nwords the will of the deity, in respect of the creation\r\nof the world, and that creation was the result of the\r\ngod's command . In very early times the Egyptian\r\ncalled in the professional religious man to utter words\r\nof good omen over the dead body of his relative or\r\nfriend, and later the same words written upon some\r\nsubstance and buried with him were believed to be\r\neffectual in procuring for him the good things of the\r\nlife beyond the grave . In the text on the pyramid\r\nof Unas (1. 583) is a reference to something written\r\nwhich the deceased was supposed to possess, in the\r\nfollowing words :- \"The bone and flesh which have\r\n\"no writing' are wretched, but, behold, the writing\r\n\"of Unas is under the great seal, and behold, it is\r\n\"not under the little seal .\" And in the text on the\r\npyramid of Pepi I we find the words, \"The uraeus of\r\n\"this Pepi is upon his head, there is a writing on\r\n\"each side of him, and he hath words of magical\r\n\"power at his two feet\" ; thus equipped the king enters\r\nheaven .\r\nIn the reign of Cheops, however, we are told 2 that\r\nhis second son Herutataf brought to the court a man\r\nr . \u00AE o sesh.\r\nz .

CXLIX\r\nwho possessed magical powers, and who was able to\r\njoin the head to a decapitated body and to make the\r\ncomplete body live again as before . When Cheops\r\nordered the head to be struck off from a prisoner that\r\nthe sage might fasten it on again, the sage excused\r\nhimself from performing this difficult task ; but when a\r\ngoose was brought, and its head was cut off and laid\r\non one side of the room and the body on the other,\r\nhe spake certain magical words, whereupon the goose\r\nstood up and begun to waddle, and the head began\r\nto move towards it . When the head had joined itself\r\nagain to the body the bird stood up and cackled. Thus,\r\nin that remote period a man claimed to be able to restore life to decapitated creatures by means of words\r\nof magical power, and it seems that the belief in the\r\nefficacy of the words of Thoth was already well established ; in the late period the mourner consoled himself by asserting that the Book of the Dead prepared\r\nfor his dead relative or friend had been written by\r\nthe fingers of the god Thoth himself.\r\nA common way to effect certain results, good or\r\nevil, was to employ figures made of various substances, chiefly wax, or amulets made of precious\r\nstones and metals in various forms ; both figures and\r\namulets were inscribed with words which gave them\r\nthe power to carry out the work assigned to them\r\nby those who caused them to be made . It is well\r\nknown that the Egyptians believed that the qualities\r\nand much else, including the ka, of a living original\r\nC L\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncould be transferred to an image thereof by means of\r\nthe repetition over it of certain formulae, and a good\r\nor evil act done to a statue or figure resulted in good\r\nor evil to the person whom it represented .\r\nIn the Westcar Papyrus we are also told that the\r\nwife of a high Egyptian official called Aba-aner fell\r\nin love with one of the king's followers, and that she\r\nsent to him and told him of her desire ; subsequently\r\nthe pair met in the woman's garden, and they passed\r\nthe day in drinking and in pleasure . On the morrow\r\nthe husband was told of his wife's conduct, and he\r\ndetermined to punish both with death. Having sent for\r\nhis ebony box bound with fine metal, he made a waxen\r\ncrocodile a few inches long, and having recited magical formulae over it he gave it to his chief servant,\r\nand told him to throw it into the water when he saw\r\nhis wife's paramour going to bathe in the evening .\r\nWhen the guilty pair had passed another day together and the young man went down to the river\r\nin the evening, the chief servant cast the waxen crocodile into the water ; and as it was falling it turned\r\ninto a huge living crocodile about twelve feet long,\r\nwhich swallowed the young man . Seven days later\r\nAba - aner and the king Neb - ka went to the water\r\nwhere the crocodile was, and Aba-aner ordered it to\r\ngive up the young man ; and it came out of the water\r\nand straightway brought up the young man . When\r\nthe king had made some remark, Aba-aner picked up\r\nthe crocodile, which at once turned into the small\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLI\r\nwaxen crocodile that it was originally, and when\r\nhe again ordered it to devour the young man, it\r\nonce more became a living reptile, and, seizing the\r\nyoung man, made its way to the water, and disappeared with him . The faithless wife was burnt. The\r\nprincipal actors in this story are said to have flourished during the rule of the third dynasty of Egypt,\r\nnearly four thousand years before Christ, and it is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that the narrative mentions the ebony\r\nand metal box and the making of a waxen crocodile\r\nin a way which seems to shew that their owner was\r\nin the habit of using the box and the wax frequently.'\r\nAbout the time of the eighteenth dynasty, we learn\r\nfrom a papyrus 2 that a man was prosecuted in Egypt\r\nfor having made figures of men and women in wax,\r\nby which he caused sundry and divers pains and\r\nsicknesses to the living beings whom they represented. And, according to Pseudo-Callisthenes, j Nectanebus wrought magic by means of a bowl of water,\r\nsome waxen figures, and an ebony rod . The waxen\r\nfigures were made in the forms of the soldiers of the\r\nenemy who were coming against him by sea or by\r\nland, and were placed upon the water in the basin\r\nby him. Nectanebus then arrayed himself in suitable\r\napparel, and, having taken the rod in his hand, bei . I have reproduced this paragraph from my Lafe and Exploits of\r\nAlexander the Great, p .

If the foe was coming by\r\nsea he placed the waxen soldiers in waxen ships, and\r\nat the sound of the words of power both ships and\r\nmen sank into the waves as the waxen models sank\r\nto the bottom of the sea . The same informant tells us\r\nthat when Nectanebus wished Olympias, the mother\r\nof Alexander the Great, to believe that the god Ammon had visited her during the night, he went forth\r\nfrom her presence into the plain and gathered a number\r\nof herbs which had the power of causing dreams, and\r\npressed out the juice from them. He then fashioned\r\na female figure in the form of Olympias, and inscribed\r\nthe Queen's name upon it, and having made the model\r\nof a bed he laid the figure thereon . Nectanebus next\r\nlit a lamp, and, reciting the words of power which\r\nwould compel the demons to send Olympias a dream,\r\nhe poured out the juice of the herbs over the waxen\r\nfigure ; and at the moment of the performance of\r\nthese acts Olympias dreamed that she was in the\r\narms of the god Ammon .\r\nA tradition also exists to the effect that Aristotle\r\ngave to Alexander the Great a number of waxen\r\nfigures nailed down in a box which was fastened by\r\na chain, and which he ordered him never to let go\r\nout of his own hand, or at least out of that of one\r\nTHE .IIAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLIII\r\nof his confidential servants . The box was to go wherever Alexander went, and Aristotle taught him to recite certain formulae over it whenever he took it up\r\nor put it down . The figures in the box were intended\r\nto represent the various kinds of armed forces that\r\nAlexander was likely to find opposed to him . Some\r\nof the models held in their hands leaden swords which\r\nwere curved backwards, and some had spears in their\r\nhands pointed head downwards, and some had bows\r\nwith cut strings ; all these were laid face downwards\r\nin the box . When Alexander was engaged in war with\r\nany nation armed with swords, or spears, or bows, if\r\nhe recited the formulae which Aristotle had taught\r\nhim, the swords of the foe would become as lead\r\nand bend backwards, the spears would become impotent in the hands of those who held them and their\r\nheads would turn to the ground, and the strings of\r\nthe bows would snap.\r\nReturning to purely Egyptian sources for information concerning the use of wax figures we come to\r\nan important work,' consisting of several Chapters\r\nwhich were to be recited to keep away storm-clouds\r\nand thunder from the sky . One Chapter reads : \"Fire\r\n\"upon thee, 0 Apep, thou enemy of Ra ! The Eye of\r\n\"Horus prevaileth over the accursed soul and shade\r\n\"of Apep, the flame of the Eye of Horus gnaweth into\r\n\"that enemy of Rd, the flame of the Eye of Horus\r\n\"eateth into all the enemies of P-aa in death and in\r\ni . For the text and translation of it see Archaeoloa ia, Vol . 52 .\r\nC LI V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"life .\" The Rubric belonging to the Chapters orders\r\nthat it shall be \"recited over Apep written in green\r\n\"ink upon a piece of new papyrus, and over a wax\r\n\"figure of Apep on which his name is inscribed in\r\n\"green ink ; this figure shall then be put in the fire\r\n\"that the enemy of Rd may be devoured . When Apep\r\n\"is put in the fire speak ye words of power and say,\r\n\"`Taste thou,' death to thee, Apep . Get thee back, re-\r\n\"treat, thou enemy of Rd, fall down, wriggle away,\r\n\"depart, retreat . I have driven thee back, I have\r\n\"hacked thee in pieces ; . . . . Back, thou fiend, an\r\n\"end to thee ! Therefore have I cast fire at thee,\r\n\"therefore have I caused thee to be destroyed, there-\r\n\"fore have I judged and condemned thee to an evil\r\n\"doom . An end to thee, an end to thee ; taste thou,\r\n\"an end to thee, mayest thou never rise up again !\r\n\"An end, an end to thee, an end to thee, taste thou,\r\n\"and come to an end. I have destroyed the enemy\r\n\u00B0\"of Ra.' This figure of Apep shall be burnt in a\r\n\"grass fire, and when burnt, its ashes are to be mixed\r\n\"with excrement and thrown into a fire . Afterwards,\r\n\"when thou hast thrown Apep into the fire at day-\r\n\"break of the festival of the six, spit upon him and\r\n,, defile him with thy left foot ; thus shall be repulsed\r\n\"the roarings of the Backward of Face . Thou shalt\r\n\"do the like of this at daybreak on the festival of\r\n\"the fifteenth day, for by means of it Apep shall be\r\n\"repulsed and slain before the Sektet boat. Thou shalt\r\ni . I. e., feel the flame .\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLV\r\n\"do the like of this when tempests rage in the east-\r\n\"\"ern parts of the sky when Rd sets in the land of\r\n\"life, to prevent the arrival of red threatening clouds\r\n\"in the eastern quarter of the sky . Thou shalt do the\r\n\"like of this many times as a preventive against the\r\n\"shower, the sun's disk shall shine, and Apep shall be\r\n\"overthrown in very truth .\" Elsewhere we are told\r\nthat if it be wished to destroy the fiends which accompany Apep we must \"write the names of their\r\n\"fathers, and mothers, and offspring with green paint\r\n\"upon new papyrus, and also inscribe their names\r\n\"upon wax figures of them which shall be tied round\r\n\"with dark hair . These figures shall be spit upon, and\r\n\"shall be spurned with the left foot and stabbed with\r\n\"a stone knife .\"\r\nThe most important mention of figures in the Book\r\nof the Dead occurs in the Vlth Chapter which, properly speaking, forms one of the texts that accompany the scene of the Funeral Chamber as exhibited\r\nin Chapter CLI. When the Egyptian, in very early\r\ndays, conceived the existence of the Ely sian Fields\r\nit occurred to him that the agricultural labours which\r\nwould have to be carried out there might entail upon\r\nhimself toil and fatigue . To avoid this a short Chapter\r\n(V) was drawn up, the recital of which was believed to\r\nfree the deceased from doing any work in the underworld. But it was felt that the work must be done\r\nby some person or thing, and eventually it became\r\nthe custom to bury a figure or figures of the de-\r\nC LV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nceased with him in his tomb so that it or they might\r\nperform whatever work fell to his share . It is probable that in semi-savage times the wealthy Egyptian's burial was accompanied by the slaughter of\r\nseveral slaves, who were supposed to follow him to\r\nthe next, world and to minister to his wants there ;\r\nthe figures which were buried with the dead in the\r\nlater times seem to have taken the place of the\r\nslaughtered slaves. To these figures the Egyptian\r\ngave the name ushabfiu, a word which is commonly\r\nrendered by \"respondents\" or \"answerers\", and they\r\nare often described in modern times as the \"working\r\nfigures of Hades\" . They are made of stone of various\r\nkinds, wood, faience, etc . ; I know of none earlier than\r\nthe XIth dynasty . They are inscribed with a text in\r\nwhich the deceased says, \"If I be called, or if I be\r\n\"adjudged to do any work whatsoever of the labours\r\n\"which are to be done in the underworld by a man\r\n\"in his turn, let the judgment fall upon thee instead\r\n\"of upon me always, in the matter of sowing the\r\n\"fields, of filling the water-courses with water, and\r\n\"of bringing the sands of the east to the west .\" To\r\nthis the shabfi figure makes reply, \"Verily I am here,\r\n\"[and will come whithersoever thou biddest me .\"\r\nSeveral of the Chapters of the Book of the Dead\r\nare followed by Rubrics_ which give directions for the\r\nperformance of certain magical ceremonies, and among\r\nthem may be specially mentioned the following :-\r\nChap . XIII . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . CLVII\r\ntwo rings made of dnkham flowers ; one was to be\r\nlaid on the right ear of the deceased, and the other\r\nwas to be wrapped up in a piece of byssus whereon\r\nthe name of the deceased was inscribed .\r\nChap . XIX. This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nthe divine chaplet which was laid upon the face of\r\nthe deceased while incense was burnt on his behalf .\r\nChap. C . This Chapter was to be recited over a\r\npicture of the boat of the Sun painted with a special\r\nink upon a piece of new papyrus, which was to be\r\nlaid on the breast of the deceased, who would then\r\nhave power to embark in the boat of Rd and to\r\njourney with the god .\r\nChap. CXXV. The Judgment Scene was to be painted upon a tile made of earth upon which neither the\r\npig nor any other animal had trodden ; and if the\r\ntext of the Chapter was also written upon it, the deceased and his children would flourish for ever, his\r\nname would never be forgotten, and his place would\r\nhenceforth be with the followers of Osiris.\r\nChap . CXXX . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\na picture of the god Rd wherein a figure of the deceased sitting in the bows was drawn ; this done the\r\nsoul of the deceased would live for ever .\r\nChap. CXXXIII . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\na faience model of the boat of Rd, four cubits in length,\r\nwhereon the figures of the divine chiefs were painted ;\r\npainted figures of Rd and of the Khu of the deceased\r\nwere to be placed in the boat. A model of the starry\r\nC LV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nheavens was also to be made and upon it the model\r\nof the boat of Rd was to be moved about, in imitation\r\nof the motion of the boat of the god in heaven ; this\r\nceremony would cause the deceased to be received\r\nby the gods in heaven as one of themselves .\r\nChap. CXXXIV. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover figures of a hawk (Rd), Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Seb,\r\nNut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys painted on a\r\nplaque which was to be placed in a model of the\r\nboat of Ra wherein the deceased was seated ; this\r\nceremony would cause the deceased to travel with\r\nRd in the sky .\r\nChap. CXXXVI A. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover a figure of the deceased seated in the boat of Ra . Chap . CXXXVII A. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover four fires, fed by a special kind of cloth anointed with unguent, which were to be placed in the hands\r\nof four men who had the names of the pillars of Horus written upon their shoulders . Four clay troughs,\r\nwhereon incense had been sprinkled, were to be filled\r\nwith the milk of a white cow, and the milk was to\r\nbe employed in extinguishing the four fires . If this\r\nChapter were recited daily (?) for the deceased he\r\nwould become like unto Osiris in every respect . The\r\nRubric supplies a series of texts which were to be\r\nrecited :(i) over a Tet of crystal set in a plinth,\r\nwhich was to be placed in the west wall of the tomb ;\r\n(2) over a figure of Anubis set in a plinth, which was\r\nto be placed in the east wall ; (3) over a brick smeared\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE ROOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLIX\r\nwith pitch which was set on fire, and then placed in\r\nthe south wall ; and (q) over a brick inscribed with\r\nthe figure of a palm tree, which was set in the north\r\nwall .\r\nChap. CXL . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nan utchat, or figure of the Eye of Horns, made either\r\nof lapis-lazuli or Mak stone, and over another made\r\nof jasper . During the recital of the Chapter four altars were to be lighted for Ra-Tem, and four for the\r\nUtchat, and four for the gods who were mentioned\r\ntherein.\r\nChap . CXLIV. The seven sections of this Chapter\r\nwere to be recited over a drawing of the Seven\r\nArits, at each of which three gods were seated ; by\r\nthese means the deceased was prevented from being\r\nturned back at the door of any one of the seven\r\nmansions of Osiris .\r\nChap . CLXII. This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nthe figure of a cow made of fine gold which was to\r\nbe placed at the neck of the deceased ; during the\r\nperformance of this ceremony the priest is ordered\r\nto say, \"O Amen, 0 Amen, who art in ' heaven, turn\r\n\"thy face upon the dead body of thy son and make\r\n\"him sound and strong in the underworld .\"\r\nChap.

CLXV. This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nthe figure of the \"god of the lifted hand\", who had\r\na body in the form of that of a beetle .\r\nBesides these a number of Chapters have Rubrics,\r\nvarying in length from two to twenty lines, which\r\ndeclare that if the deceased be acquainted with their\r\ncontents or if they be inscribed upon his coffin, they\r\nwill enable him to attain great happiness and freedom in the world beyond the grave . Seven other\r\nChapters consist of texts which were written upon\r\nthe amulets that were usually laid upon the mummy,\r\nnamely Nos . XXX B, LXXXIX, CLV, CLVI, CLVII,\r\nCLVIII, and CLIX . Chapter XXX B is found inscribed\r\nupon thousands of large green basalt scarabs, which\r\nwere usually set in a banded frame of gold and laid\r\ninside or upon the breast, just over the heart ; it is\r\nalso found inscribed upon green basalt amulets made\r\nin the form of the heart .' The object of this amulet\r\nwas to preserve the heart of the deceased and to protect it from the attacks of those who were thought to\r\nsteal away the hearts of the dead ; its use is as old\r\nas the IV th dynasty, in which period the text was\r\nnot cut but painted upon it . Chapter LXXXIX, which\r\nwas written to ensure the union of the soul with the\r\ni . I have described the chief examples of this amulet in my Papyrus\r\nof Am', p . z6z .\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLXI\r\nbody in the underworld, was recited over the humanheaded hawk made of gold and inlaid with precious\r\nstones which was laid upon the neck of the mummy ;\r\nexamples of this amulet have been found with a few\r\nwords of the Chapter inscribed upon them . Chapter\r\nCLV is found inscribed upon Tets made of gold and\r\nprecious stones which have been found attached to\r\nthe neck of the mummy ; this amulet represents the\r\ntree-trunk, with four branches pointing to the four\r\ncardinal points, which contained the dead body of\r\nOsiris, and it bestowed upon its possessor stability\r\nand lasting preservation . Chapter CLVI is found inscribed upon several carnelian \"buckles\" which have\r\nbeen found attached to the neck of the mummy ; this\r\namulet gave to the deceased the powers which were\r\nenshrined in the blood and power and enchantments\r\nof the goddess Isis . Chapter CLVII is found inscribed\r\nupon gold vultures which have been found attached\r\nto the neck of the mummy ; this amulet gave the\r\ndeceased the protection of the goddess Isis such as\r\nshe exercised on behalf of her own son Horus . Chapter CLVIII was inscribed upon the collar of gold which\r\nwas placed on the neck of the mummy ; this amulet\r\ngave the deceased freedom from the bandages with\r\nwhich he was swathed. Chapter CL IX is found inscribed upon several mother-of-emerald sceptres which\r\nwere attached to the neck of the mummy ; this amulet gave \"protection\" or \"strength\" to the deceased .\r\nChapter CLXII is found inscribed upon circular pieces\r\nk\r\nC LXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nof papyri laid down upon cartonnazie backs, commonly\r\nknown as \"hypocephali\" ; they were placed under the\r\nback of the head of the mummy and by this warmth,\r\nsimilar to that which he possessed upon earth, was\r\nimparted . Chapter CLXVI is found inscribed upon\r\nsmall pillows made of haematite and other substances ; as the ordinary pillow raised the head of the\r\nmummy from the bed of the coffin, so this amulet\r\nraised the head of the deceased in the horizon and\r\nprevented it from being laid low . Finally, figures of\r\nthe gods in metal, stone, faience, wood, wax, etc.,\r\nwere attached to the mummy in order to place it\r\nunder the special protection of the deities whom they\r\nrepresented. The following are the amulets which are\r\ncommonly found in Egyptian tombs, and their significations :-\r\ni .\r\n\u00B0a\r\nthet\r\n\r\nBuckle.

CLXV\r\nFinally, mention must be made here of the great\r\nimportance attached by the Egyptians to the knowledge of the names of gods, supernatural beings, etc .,\r\nand it seems that the deceased who was ignorant of\r\nthem must have fared badly in the underworld . Thus\r\nin Chapter I B (see p . 24) it is said that the deceased\r\nknoweth Osiris and his names ; in Chapter XCIX (see\r\np . 158) the deceased is obliged to tell the names of\r\nevery portion of the boat wherein he wishes to cross\r\nthe great river in the underworld ; in Chapter CXXV\r\n(p . 19o) Anubis makes him declare the names of the\r\ntwo leaves of the door of the Hall of Osiris before he\r\nwill let him in, and even the bolts, and bolt-sockets,\r\nand lintels, and planks will not allow him to enter\r\nuntil the deceased has satisfied them that he knows\r\ntheir names . Entrance into the seven Arits or mansions (see p . 240) could not be obtained without a\r\nknowledge of the names of the doorkeeper, watcher,\r\nand herald who belonged to each ; and similarly, the\r\npylons of the domains of Osiris (see p . 243 f .) could\r\nnot be passed through by the deceased without a\r\ndeclaration by him of the name of each. The idea\r\nunderlying all such statements is that the man who\r\nknows the name of a god could invoke and obtain help\r\nfrom him by calling upon him, and that the hostility\r\nof a fiend could be successfully opposed by the repetition of his name . The knowledge of the names\r\nof fiends and demons constituted the chief power of\r\nthe magicians of olden times, and the amulets of\r\nC LXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe Gnostics which were inscribed with numbers of\r\nnames of supernatural powers are the practical expression of the belief in the efficacy of the knowledge of names which existed in Egypt from time\r\nimmemorial.\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS OF THE\r\nBOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\nThough the Chapters of the Book of the Dead represent beliefs belonging to various periods of the\r\nlong life of the Egyptian nation, and opinions held\r\nby several schools of thought in Egypt, the object\r\nof them all was to benefit the deceased . They were\r\nintended to give him the power to have and to enjoy life everlasting, to give him everything which he\r\nrequired in the life beyond the grave, to ensure -his\r\nvictory over his foes, to procure for him the power of\r\ngoing whithersoever he pleased and when and how he\r\npleased, to preserve the mummy intact, and finally to\r\nenable his soul to enter into the bark of Ra or into\r\nwhatever abode of the blessed had been conceived of\r\nby him. A perusal of the translations of the Chapters\r\nwill shew the reader what their contents are, but it\r\nwill not be out of place here to group certain Chapters which have a common object, for the various beliefs which they represent then become more clear .\r\nA certain number of the Chapters of the Book of\r\nthe Dead are hymns which are addressed either to\r\nC LXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nRd or to Osiris. In the present work these are represented by the hymns from the papyri of Ani, Qenna,\r\nHu-nefer, and Nekht (see pp . 3-I2), which I have\r\ncalled \"Hymns Introductory\", and to these we should\r\nadd Chapters CLXXXII and CLXXXIII, which are really hymns to Osiris by Thoth . Another collection of\r\nfine hymns is found in Chapter XV, where we have\r\nhymns to Rd and Osiris, and a Litany to Osiris ; the\r\nPapyrus of Ani, from which these are translated, gives\r\nthe oldest and most complete form of the Chapter .\r\nThey are most important, for they enable us to understand what attributes were ascribed to Ra, and it\r\nseems as if many of them were, in later times, transferred to Osiris, who was originally nothing but a god\r\nof the dead .\r\nWith these hymns should be mentioned the texts\r\nwhich accompany the judgment Scene, but these have\r\nalready been described in the chapter on that subject\r\ngiven above, and they are fully translated on pp . 12\r\n-15 . The Judgment Scene also leads us to the consideration of the CXXVth Chapter, which is certainly\r\none of the most important and interesting in the whole\r\nbook. It consists of three parts :-- Introduction, Negative Confession, and Concluding Text . The Introduction was said by the deceased at the entrance to\r\nthe Hall of double Maati, the Negative Confession\r\nwas recited by him before the forty-two gods who\r\nsat in judgment upon him in this Hall, and the Concluding Text was uttered by him when he had passed\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXIX\r\nthe ordeal of judgment and was beginning his new\r\nlife . It is probable that these three texts were originally merely versions each of the other, but in the\r\neighteenth dynasty they are all copied together into\r\npapyri. The deceased first asserted that he had not\r\ncommitted certain sins ; he next addressed forty-two\r\ngods by their names and declared before each that\r\nhe had not committed the special sin which it was\r\nthe duty of the god to punish ; and lastly he makes\r\na third confession, the first part of which is practically\r\nin the same words as a portion of the Introduction .\r\nThe Introduction provided the passwords which enabled him to enter the Hall, and the Concluding Text\r\nprovided those which enabled him to go forth from\r\nit . It is impossible to say when or how this beautiful\r\nChapter with its lofty conceptions of morality grew,\r\nbut, although the form in which these are set forth\r\nis not older than the eighteenth dynasty, the ideas\r\nthemselves belong to a period which is as old as\r\nthe rule of the kings of the third dynasty . From the\r\nNegative Confession we see that the pious Egyptian\r\nabhorred fraud, theft, deceit, robbery with violence,\r\niniquity of every kind, adultery, unchastity and sins\r\nof wantonness, manslaughter, murder, incitement to\r\nmurder, and that he delighted in shewing he had\r\nwronged none in any way . He neither purloined the\r\nthings which belonged to his god, nor did he slay\r\nthe sacred animals ; he thought not lightly of the god\r\nof his city, and he never cursed him . He honoured\r\nC LXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nhis king, and he neither wasted his neighbour's ploughed lands nor defiled his running stream . He spake not\r\nhaughtily, he behaved not insolently, he multiplied not\r\nhis speech overmuch, he abused no man, he attacked\r\nno man, he swore not at all, he stirred not up strife, he\r\nterrified no man, he was not a man of wrath, he spake\r\nevil of none, and he never pried into matters to make\r\nmischief. He judged not hastily, he defrauded not his\r\nneighbour in the market, he shut not his ears to the\r\nwords of right and truth, he sought not honours, he\r\nnever gave way to anger except for a proper cause,\r\nand he sought not to enrich himself at the expense\r\nof his neighbours. It is difficult to give the exact\r\nshades of meaning of many of the words in this Confession, but the general sense is thoroughly well made\r\nout ; the Egyptian code of morals, as may be seen\r\nfrom the CXXVth Chapter, was the grandest and most\r\ncomprehensive of those now known to have existed\r\namong the nations of antiquity .\r\nThe CXth Chapter, which describes the employments\r\nand enjoyments of the deceased in the Sekhet-hetep\r\nand Sekhet-Aaru, or Elysian Fields, contains ideas of\r\nthe greatest antiquity, which date, probably, from the\r\ntime when the system of village communities was in\r\nvogue in Egypt. The deceased ploughs, sows, and\r\nreaps, and lives exactly the same kind of life as a\r\nfarmer would live in the fertile lands of the Delta,\r\nand it would seem that he enjoys all the pleasures\r\nwhich a human being enjoys upon earth . In the Vth\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC .\r\n\r\nCLXXI\r\nChapter of the Book of the Dead the deceased found\r\na text which would free him from certain agricultural\r\nlabours which had to be done in the Elysian fields,\r\nbut inasmuch as the work of watering and top-dressing the fields and sowing the crops had to be done\r\nby some one, figures, made in the form of the deceased and inscribed with his name, were buried with\r\nthe dead to toil for him . Such figures have often in\r\ntheir hands models of the basket in which the field\r\nlabourer carried earth and the hoe with which he\r\nfilled it ; and the text of the VI th Chapter, which\r\nwas also inscribed upon them, provided the deceased\r\nwith substitutes to toil for him in the farms of the\r\ngods .\r\nThe reader will seek, and seek in . vain, for many\r\nof the attributes of the prayers of Christian nations,\r\nand it is a noticeable fact that the Egyptian had no\r\nconception of repentance ; at the judgment which took\r\nplace in the Hall of Osiris he based his claim for admission into the kingdom of that god upon the fact\r\nthat he had not committed certain sins, and that he\r\nhad feared God and honoured the king, and had given\r\nbread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to\r\nthe naked, and a boat to him that had suffered shipwreck on the Nile . His belief in the efficacy of works\r\nwas great, and, when he had any doubt about their\r\npower to deliver him finally from the hosts of darkness, he protected himself by means of amulets, inscribed or plain, and figures of gods painted upon\r\nC LXXI I\r\n\r\nINTR OD UCTION.\r\nhis coffin and papyrus, or cut in wood or on stones\r\nwhich possessed magical powers . The Chapters which\r\nrefer to such amulets are Nos . XIII, XIX, XXX B,\r\nLXXXIX, C, CXXV, CXXX, CXXXIII, CXXXIV,\r\nCXXXVIA, CXXXVIIA, CXL, CXLIV, CLVI, CLVII,\r\nCLVIII, CLIX, CLXII, CLXIII, CLXIV, CLXV, and\r\nCLXVI.\r\nOne of the most interesting Chapters in the whole\r\nbook is the XVII th, which contains a series of statements concerning the origin of the gods and the things\r\nof the next world . To many of these statements more\r\nthan one explanation of their meaning is appended, and\r\nas these occur in copies of the Chapter which are\r\nfound inscribed upon coffins of the eleventh dynasty,\r\nit is clear that already at that early date several\r\nopinions on these matters existed . The views expressed in the Chapter appear to be those of the ancient College of Priests at Heliopolis which became\r\ngradually adopted throughout Egypt . The Vignettes\r\nwhich accompany the Chapter in the best illuminated\r\npapyri are most elaborate, and they shew by their\r\nattention to detail that it formed one of the most\r\nimportant of the texts of this class which were copied for general use .\r\nThe LXIVth Chapter was very highly esteemed,\r\nand it was believed to be one of the oldest parts of\r\nthe Book of the Dead. Already in the eleventh dynasty it existed in two versions, one of which was\r\nthought to have been composed or edited in the first\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXIII\r\ndynasty, and the other in the fourth dynasty . The\r\nlonger version is entitled simply \"The Chapter of\r\nComing Forth by Day in the underworld\", but the\r\nshorter is described as \"The Chapter of knowing the\r\n`Chapters of Coming Forth by Day' in a single Chapter\" . Whether we are to understand by the latter title\r\nthat the Chapter contained the essence of all the\r\nChapters of the Book of the Dead and that the deceased who was provided with it was as well protected as if he had copies of them all, is not quite\r\nclear, but it seems probable . It will be noticed that\r\nseveral Chapters are called \"Chapters of Coming\r\nForth by Day\", and among them may be specially\r\nnoticed :- Chapters II and III, which provide that the\r\ndeceased may come forth in the underworld and \"live\r\nafter he hath died, even as doth Ra day by day\" ;\r\nChapter LXV, which provides that the Khu of the\r\ndeceased shall live and shall inflict blows upon his\r\nenemy ; Chapter LXVI, which gives the deceased\r\npower to \"alight upon the forehead of Ra\" ; Chapter\r\nLXVIII, which gives him mastery over everything\r\nwhich is in the underworld, and enables him to journey about among the living ; Chapters LXIX, LXX,\r\nand LXXI, wherein he identifies himself with Osiris,\r\nSah (Orion), Anubis, Horus, and Tem, and declares\r\nhis power over the winds of heaven ; Chapter LXXII,\r\nwhich enables him to \"come forth by day in all the\r\nforms which he pleaseth to take\" and to enter into\r\nan abode in the Elysian Fields, where he shall be\r\nC LXXI V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. amply provided with wheat and barley ; and Chapter\r\nCLXXX, which enables him to go about in the underworld with freedom of movement and to perform all\r\nthe transformations of a \"living soul\" .\r\nAn important group of Chapters referring to the\r\ntransformations which a man may undergo, if he\r\npleases, in the underworld, is introduced by Chapter\r\nLXXVI, wherein the deceased declares that he has\r\nbeen led unto the \"House of the King\" by the mantes, or so-called \"praying insect\" . These Chapters enable him to transform himself into a hawk of gold\r\n(Chap. LXXVII), into a divine hawk (Chap . LXXVIII),\r\ninto the Governor of the divine sovereign princes\r\n(Chap . LXXIX), into the god who giveth light in the\r\ndarkness (Chap . LXXX), into a lotus (Chaps . LXXXI A\r\nand LXXXI B), into the god Ptah and into a living\r\nbeing in Annu (Chap . LXXXII), into a Bennu (phoenix?) (Chap . LXXXIII), into a heron (Chap . LXXXIV),\r\ninto a living soul (Chap . LXXXV), into a swallow (Chap .\r\nLXXXVI), into the serpent Sata (Chap . LXXXVII), and\r\ninto a crocodile (Chap . LXXXVIII).\r\nA considerable number of Chapters refer, as we\r\nshould naturally expect, to the preservation of the\r\nbody of the deceased in the tomb, and several were\r\nexpressly written to give him power to resist the attacks of enemies, and to obtain meat, and drink, and\r\nthe power of motion in the underworld. Thus Chapter I, which is proved by its title and Vignette to\r\nrefer to the ceremonies which took place on the day\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXV\r\nof the funeral, provides for the burial of the body in\r\nthe proper way so that \"the deceased may go in after\r\ncoming forth\" ; and Chapters VIII, IX, XI, XII, XIII,\r\nXLVIII, LXVII, CVII, CXVIII, CXIX, CXXII, CLXI,\r\nand CLXXX enable him to make his way in the way\r\nunderworld without let or hindrance and to overcome\r\nhis enemies . The deceased wished to protect himself\r\nby means of magical formulae ; Chapter XXIV provides\r\nthese formulae for him, and Chapter XXXII gives him\r\nthe power to keep hold of them . Chapters XXI and\r\nXXII give the deceased a mouth, and Chapter XXIII\r\nprovides him with the power of opening it ; Chapter\r\nXXV gave him the faculty of remembering his\r\nname. Seven Chapters (XXVI-XXX B) gave him a\r\nheart, and provided him with prayers and formulae,\r\nwhich prevented those who stole hearts from snatching it away from him and from driving it away from\r\nhim when it was weighed in the judgment Hall of\r\nOsiris . The crocodile, which came to steal away the\r\nwords of power and protection which the deceased\r\nhad with him, was repulsed by the words of Chapter\r\nXXXI. Chapters XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI,\r\nXXXVII, and XXXIX prevented him from being stung\r\nor bitten by snakes and serpents, and did away with\r\nthe power of the beetle (?) aj5shait to gnaw his body\r\nto pieces . Chapters XXXVIII A and XXXVIII B enabled him to escape from the deadly cobra, and\r\nChapter XL delivered him from the power of the\r\nserpent who, though he is here acting as the friend\r\nC LX XV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nof Horus by devouring the Ass which typifies the\r\nfiend Set, is, nevertheless, to be feared . In the underworld and the cities thereof punishment was inflicted\r\non the dead, and to provide the favoured of Osiris\r\nwith power to escape from stripes, and wounds, and\r\ndecapitation at the deadly block Chapters XLI, XLII,\r\nXLIII, and L were composed . The deceased wished\r\nfor a seat in the celestial Annu (Heliopolis), and this\r\nwas given him by Chapter LXXV, and Chapter XLVII\r\nprevented his throne and his habitation from being\r\nremoved by any hostile being. He sighed to have\r\npower over running water and to snuff the sweet\r\nbreath of the north wind, and these comforts were\r\nsecured for him by Chapters LIV, LV, LVI, LVII,\r\nLVIII, LIX, LX, LXI, and LXII ; the large number\r\nof Chapters written for this purpose will shew how\r\ngreat was the anxiety of the Egyptian in this matter .\r\nAs fire and boiling water existed in the underworld\r\nhe hastened to protect himself from burns or scalds\r\nby the use of Chapters LXIII A and LXIII B . Proper\r\nfood was as necessary to the ka or double of the deceased as fresh air and water, and to ensure it against\r\nthe need to eat filth and to drink dirty water Chapters LII, LIII, CV, CX, CXLVIII and CLXXXIX were\r\ncomposed ; the idea of the ka being obliged to wander about starving and in search of food was so abhorrent to the pious Egyptian that every text which\r\ncould in any wise help to secure sufficient meat and\r\ndrink for it was gladly copied over and over again .\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXVII\r\nThe object of Chapters IV, LXXIV, CXVII, CXIX,\r\nwas to enable the deceased to walk about at will,\r\nand to roam through Re-stau, or the passages of the\r\ntomb and underworld, and when his way was stopped\r\nby Apep, Chapter VII enabled him to pass over the\r\nback of the fiend. The union of the soul with the\r\nbody was provided for by Chapter LXXXIX, as\r\nwas the escape of the soul and the shade from the\r\nbonds of the tomb by Chapters XCI and XCIL Though\r\nthe deceased had no wish to go to the east in the\r\nunderworld (see Chap . XCIII) he, nevertheless, wished to visit the celestial Abydos ; a successful journey to this city was secured by the use of Chapter CXXXVIII. In spite of the best efforts of the\r\nembalmers bodies sometimes rotted and perished\r\nin their tombs ; such calamities were averted by\r\nChapters XLV and XLVI, and especially by Chapter\r\nCLIV, which is one of the most interesting in the\r\nwhole book. Overthrow in the underworld was averted by the use of Chapter LI, the wrath of the god\r\nwas appeased by Chapter XIV, and the danger of\r\ndying a second time was done away with by Chapters XLIV, CLXXV, and CLXXVI . The love of ritual\r\nand ceremony induced the Egyptians to take special\r\ncare about the arrangement of the mummy, and coffin,\r\nand funeral furniture in the mummy chamber, and to\r\nmake certain that all was properly done in this matter,\r\nChapter CLI, which consists of a view of the chamber\r\nand a group of short but important texts, was coma\r\nC LXXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nposed. The type of this chamber was, of course, the\r\ntomb of Osiris. The Hall of Osiris wherein the god\r\ndwelt with his princes could only be reached after\r\ncertain doors, and mansions, and domains, which were\r\nguarded by porters in the form of monsters, had been\r\nsuccessfully . passed through by the deceased ; to enable the deceased to go through the seven mansions,\r\nand the twenty-one pylons, and the fifteen domains,\r\nChapters CXLIV-CXLVII, CXLIX, and CL were\r\nwritten. These provided the deceased with the names\r\nof the beings who were in charge of the doors, and\r\nsupplied him with the speeches which it was necessary that he should make . During his journey in the\r\nunderworld the deceased came to a huge river which\r\nhe was obliged to cross ; to enable him to embark in\r\nthe mystical boat, every portion of which possessed\r\na name which he was bound to know and be able to\r\nrepeat, he provided himself with Chapters XCVIII and\r\nXCIX. But this boat only served to take him across\r\nthe river, and he longed to be able to embark in the\r\nBoat of Rd, and to sit in its bows and to sail about\r\nwith the god for ever ; this delight, however, could\r\nonly be secured for him by means of Chapters C, CI,\r\nCII, CXXXIV, CXXXVIA, and CXXXVI B, and, as a\r\nresult, copies of most of these Chapters exist in nearly all large papyri . The Egyptian believed that he\r\nwould encounter the foes who attacked Osiris in the\r\nunderworld, and that the calamities which befel the\r\ngod would come upon him also ; he who delivered\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXIX\r\nOsiris out of all his troubles was Thoth, the scribe\r\nof the gods, and to him were addressed Chapters\r\nXVIII and XX, which secured for the deceased\r\nthe protection and triumph which this god had secured for \"his brother Osiris\" . The favour of Thoth\r\nwas so necessary that four Chapters (XCIV, XCV,\r\nXCVI, XCVII) were written to instruct the deceased\r\nto make an offering of a palette and an ink-jar to\r\nthe god, and how to become nigh unto him . Before\r\nthe deceased could roam at will in the underworld\r\nit was necessary that he should know the deities of\r\nthe chief cities of the four quarters of the land wherein he was ; Chapters CVII and CVIII enabled him to\r\nknow the \"souls of Amentet\", (1 . e ., of the West), Chapter CIX enabled him to know the \"souls of the East\",\r\nChapter CXII enabled him to know the \"souls of the\r\ncity of Pe\" [in the north], Chapter CXIII enabled him\r\nto know the \"souls of the city of Nekhen\" [in the\r\nsouth], Chapter CXV enabled him to know the \"souls\r\nof Annu\", and Chapters CXIV and CXVI enabled him\r\nto know the \"souls of the city of Khemennu\" (Hermopolis) . In the underworld the deceased was threatened\r\nby the danger of the snarer or fowler and his net,\r\nand Chapters CLIIIA and CLIMB were written to enable him to escape from them . Two Chapters, CLXIX\r\nand CLXX, provided for the stablishing of the funeral bed of the deceased ; two Chapters, CLXVIII A\r\nand CLXVIII B, set out at length the libations which\r\nit was necessary for him to pour out ; Chapter CXXIII\r\n1*\r\nC LXXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. .\r\ngave him power to enter the \"Great House\" ; Chapters CXXVI, CXXVII, CXXVIII, CLXXXV, and\r\nCLXXXVI supplied him with the prayers which had\r\nto be said to the holy apes, and to the gods who\r\nwere the leaders and guides in the underworld, and\r\nto Osiris and Hathor ; Chapter CXXXII enabled him\r\nto go back to see his house ; Chapter CLII gave him\r\npower to build a house upon earth ; Chapter CLXXI\r\nprovided him with the girdle of purity ; Chapters CIII,\r\nCXXIV, CXXXI, and CLXXXI gave him power to\r\ngo in before the divine sovereign chiefs of Osiris and\r\nto be nigh unto Ra ; Chapter CIV gave him a seat\r\namong the \"great gods\" ; and Chapter CLXXXIV\r\nbrought him \"nigh unto Osiris\" . Chapter CXXX, which\r\n\"made perfect the Khu\", was ordered to be recited\r\non the birthday of Osiris ; Chapter CXXXIII made\r\nthe Khu perfect before the Great Company of the\r\ngods ; Chapter CXXXV, which was to be recited on\r\nthe day of the new moon, gave the deceased power\r\nto become like unto Thoth ; Chapter CXL, which was\r\nto be recited on the last day of the sixth month of\r\nth ; Egyptian year, enabled him to appear in glory\r\nbefore all the gods when the utchat, or Eye of Rd,\r\nwas full ; and Chapter CLXVII conferred upon him\r\nthe power which the utchat possessed and enabled\r\nhim to identify himself with it . Chapters CXLI and\r\nCXLII provided the texts which a man was directed\r\nto recite \"for his father or for his son during the\r\nfestival of Amentet\", they made the deceased to be\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXXI\r\nperfect with Rd and with the gods ; and Chapter\r\nCLXXIII contained the addresses which Horus made\r\nto his father Osiris, and which were also assumed to\r\nbe made to the deceased by Horus . Chapter CLXXII\r\nis a remarkable and beautiful composition in nine sections, the contents of which were first made known\r\nin detail by M. Naville ; in it the limbs of the deceased are described in highly poetical language, and\r\nthe comparisons at times resemble the descriptions of\r\nthe limbs of the beloved one in the Song of Solomon . Four Chapters, CLXII, CLXIII, CLXIV, and\r\nCLXV, have no equivalents in the Recensions of the\r\nBook of the Dead older than the twenty-sixth dynasty, and as they contain foreign words and foreign\r\nideas they are probably the work of non-Egyptian\r\nauthors ; each of them is followed by a long Rubric\r\nwhich orders certain curious amulets to be made and\r\nthe performance of ceremonies . In Chapters CLXXIV,\r\nCLXXVII, and CLXXVIII we have extracts from the\r\nold Heliopolitan Recension of the Book of the Dead\r\nwhich was in use in the fifth and sixth dynasties, and\r\nthe comparison of the texts, which, thanks to M . Maspero, we are now able to make, is very instructive .\r\nWe can see how misunderstandings of the meaning\r\nof certain passages arose through the want of adequate determinatives, and we can note how later copyists modified and adapted old texts to suit modern\r\nviews. Thus in the passage from the text of Un is\r\n(1 . 166 ff., see is fra, p. 329 we have a reference to\r\nC LXXXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe love-making ` of the deceased which is entirely\r\nomitted from the later copy of it given in the Papyrus of Nebseni ; and it seems as if the ideas expressed in it found no favour with the cultured mind of\r\nNebseni, the great designer, draughtsman, and artist, who was attached to the Temple of Ptah at\r\nMemphis . In a similar manner it will be noticed that\r\nmost of the coarse expressions and ideas which are\r\nfound in the religious books of the old period have\r\nno counterparts in the Theban Recension of the Book\r\nof the Dead .\r\nIt will be seen from the above brief summary that,\r\nalthough the contents of the papyri containing the\r\nTheban Recension are miscellaneous, there are references to other works connected with the burial of\r\nthe dead from which no extracts are given . Among\r\nsuch may be specially mentioned the texts which are\r\nconnected with the performance of the ceremony of\r\n\"Opening the mouth\" (see i)fra, p. 70), but as it is\r\nimpossible to give any adequate description of them\r\nin the space now left to me, I refer the reader to\r\nmy Papyrus of Ail*, p . 265 ff.\r\ni . M. Maspero's rendering of the passage (see Les Inscriptions des\r\nPyranides de Saggarah, p . zi) runs :- \"0 Ra, sois bon pour lui en ce\r\njour des hier ; car Ounas a connu la deesse Maouit, Ounas a respire la\r\nflamme d'Isi .

No . to,,17o, sheet 2) .]\r\nThe scene to which Lepsius inadvertently gave the number\r\nXVI and which he regarded as a Chapter of the Book of the\r\nDead is, strictly speaking, only a vignette intended to accompany the hymn to the rising Sun that forms part of the introductory matter to the Chapters of the Book of the Dead which\r\nwe find in some of the oldest papyri of the Theban period .\r\nr . I. e , the dead .\r\n2 . The name of the deceased is\r\nwanting .\r\n4 6 THE CJLIPTTRS OF COMING FORTH BY DAY .\r\nIn the Papyrus of Ani we see the Sun's disk supported by a pair\r\nof arms which emerge from the sign of life ; this, in its turn,\r\nis supported by the pillar which symbolizes the tree-trunk which\r\ncontained the dead body of Osiris . This pillar rests upon the\r\nhorizon . On each side of it are three apes typical of the Spirits\r\nof the Dawn, adoring the disk ; on the right is the goddess\r\nNephthys and on the left is the goddess Isis, Nephthys kneels\r\nupon the symbol of the sunset, and Isis upon the symbol of the\r\ndawn. Above the whole scene is the vaulted sky . In the Papyrus\r\nof Hu-nefer the pillar is endowed with human arms and hands,\r\nwhich grasp the crook and flail, emblematic of Osiris' reign and\r\nrule, and the two goddesses are standing upright ; one says\r\n\"I am thy sister Nephthys\", and the other : \"I am thy sister\r\nIsis, the divine mother.\" The sun is typified by a hawk having\r\na disk, encircled by an uraeus, upon his head . The apes are\r\nhere seven in number, four stand in front and three behind ;\r\nabove the whole scene is the vaulted sky .\r\nCertain papyri have also vignettes which illustrate the hymns to\r\nthe setting sun . 2 In this case the hawk usually stands upon the\r\nemblem of the West while apes and gods adore him . In the\r\nPapyrus of Qenna on the right three hawk-headed gods kneel\r\nin adoration with their left arms raised, and on the left three\r\njackal-headed gods, with their right arms raised in adoration .\r\nBelow, two lion-headed gods, with disks on their heads, are seated\r\nback to back in a cluster of lotus flowers ; these typify dawn\r\nand eventide . The goddess Isis kneels in adoration before the\r\nlion of the dawn, and the goddess Nephthys before the lion of\r\neventide .\r\nCHAPTER XV11.\r\n[From the Papyrus of Ani (Brit . Mus .

CROCKER  COMPANY,  INCORPORATED <br/>MCMXXVIII <br/><br/>[1928,  no  renewal] <br/><br/><br/>p-5 <br/><br/><br/>PREFACE <br/><br/>NUMEROUS  volumes  have  been  written  as  commentaries  upon  the  secret  systems  of  philosophy <br/>existing  in  the  ancient  world,  but  the  ageless  truths  of  life,  like  many  of  the  earth's  greatest  thinkers, <br/>have  usually  been  clothed  in  shabby  garments.  The  present  work  is  an  attempt  to  supply  a  tome <br/>worthy  of  those  seers  and  sages  whose  thoughts  are  the  substance  of  its  pages.  To  bring  about  this <br/>coalescence  of  Beauty  and  Truth  has  proved  most  costly,  but  I  believe  that  the  result  will  produce  an <br/>effect  upon  the  mind  of  the  reader  which  will  more  than  justify  the  expenditure. <br/><br/>Work  upon  the  text  of  this  volume  was  begun  the  first  day  of  January,  1926,  and  has  continued  almost <br/>uninterruptedly  for  over  two  years.  The  greater  part  of  the  research  work,  however,  was  carried  on <br/>prior  to  the  writing  of  the  manuscript.  The  collection  of  reference  material  was  begun  in  1921,  and <br/>three  years  later  the  plans  for  the  book  took  definite  form.  For  the  sake  of  clarity,  all  footnotes  were <br/>eliminated,  the  various  quotations  and  references  to  other  authors  being  embodied  in  the  text  in  their <br/>logical  order.  The  bibliography  is  appended  primarily  to  assist  those  interested  in  selecting  for  future <br/>study  the  most  authoritative  and  important  items  dealing  with  philosophy  and  symbolism.  To  make <br/>readily  accessible  the  abstruse  information  contained  in  the  book,  an  elaborate  topical  cross  index  is <br/>included. <br/><br/>I  make  no  claim  for  either  the  infallibility  or  the  originality  of  any  statement  herein  contained.  I  have <br/>studied  the  fragmentary  writings  of  the  ancients  sufficiently  to  realize  that  dogmatic  utterances <br/>concerning  their  tenets  are  worse  than  foolhardy.  Traditionalism  is  the  curse  of  modern  philosophy, <br/>particularly  that  of  the  European  schools.  While  many  of  the  statements  contained  in  this  treatise <br/>may  appear  at  first  wildly  fantastic,  I  have  sincerely  endeavored  to  refrain  from  haphazard <br/>metaphysical  speculation,  presenting  the  material  as  far  as  possible  in  the  spirit  rather  than  the  letter <br/>of  the  original  authors.  By  assuming  responsibility  only  for  the  mistakes  which  may'  appear  herein,  I <br/>hope  to  escape  the  accusation  of  plagiarism  which  has  been  directed  against  nearly  every  writer  on <br/>the  subject  of  mystical  philosophy. <br/><br/>Having  no  particular  ism  of  my  own  to  promulgate,  I  have  not  attempted  to  twist  the  original  writings <br/>to  substantiate  preconceived  notions,  nor  have  I  distorted  doctrines  in  any  effort  to  reconcile  the <br/>irreconcilable  differences  present  in  the  various  systems  of  religio-philosophic  thought. <br/><br/>The  entire  theory  of  the  book  is  diametrically  opposed  to  the  modem  method  of  thinking,  for  it  is <br/>concerned  with  subjects  openly  ridiculed  by  the  sophists  of  the  twentieth  century.  Its  true  purpose  is <br/>to  introduce  the  mind  of  the  reader  to  a  hypothesis  of  living  wholly  beyond  the  pale  of  materialistic <br/>theology,  philosophy,  or  science.  The  mass  of  abstruse  material  between  its  covers  is  not  susceptible <br/>to  perfect  organization,  but  so  far  as  possible  related  topics  have  been  grouped  together. <br/><br/>Rich  as  the  English  language  is  in  media  of  expression,  it  is  curiously  lacking  in  terms  suitable  to  the <br/>conveyance  of  abstract  philosophical  premises.  A  certain  intuitive  grasp  of  the  subtler  meanings <br/>concealed  within  groups  of  inadequate  words  is  necessary  therefore  to  an  understanding  of  the <br/>ancient  Mystery  Teachings. <br/><br/>Although  the  majority  of  the  items  in  the  bibliography  are  in  my  own  library,  I  wish  to  acknowledge <br/>gratefully  the  assistance  rendered  by  the  Public  Libraries  of  San  Francisco  and  Los  Angeles,  the <br/>libraries  of  the  Scottish  Rite  in  San  Francisco  and  Los  Angeles,  the  libraries  of  the  University  of <br/>California  in  Berkeley  and  Los  Angeles,  the  Mechanics'  Library  in  San  Francisco,  and  the  Krotona <br/>Theosophical  Library  at  Ojai,  California.  Special  recognition  for  their  help  is  also  due  to  the  following <br/>persons:  Mrs.  Max  Heindel,  Mrs.  Alice  Palmer  Henderson,  Mr.  Ernest  Dawson  and  staff,  Mr.  John <br/><br/><br/>Howell,  Mr.  Paul  Elder,  Mr.  Phillip  Watson  Hackett,  and  Mr.  John  R.  Ruckstell.  Single  books  were <br/>lent  by  other  persons  and  organizations,  to  whom  thanks  are  also  given. <br/><br/>The  matter  of  translation  was  the  greatest  single  task  in  the  research  work  incident  to  the  preparation <br/>of  this  volume.  The  necessary <br/><br/>p.  6 <br/><br/>German  translations,  which  required  nearly  three  years,  were  generously  undertaken  by  Mr.  Alfred <br/>Beri,  who  declined  all  remuneration  for  his  labor.  The  Latin,  Italian,  French,  and  Spanish  translations <br/>were  made  by  Prof.  Homer  P.  Earle.  The  Hebrew  text  was  edited  by  Rabbi  Jacob  M.  Alkow. <br/>Miscellaneous  short  translations  and  checking  also  were  done  by  various  individuals. <br/><br/>The  editorial  work  was  under  the  supervision  of  Dr.  C.  B.  Rowlingson,  through  whose  able  efforts <br/>literary  order  was  often  brought  out  of  literary  chaos.  Special  recognition  is  also  due  the  services <br/>rendered  by  Mr.  Robert  B.  Tummonds,  of  the  staff  of  H.  S.  Crocker  Company,  Inc.,  to  whom  were <br/>assigned  the  technical  difficulties  of  fitting  the  text  matter  into  its  allotted  space.  For  much  of  the <br/>literary  charm  of  the  work  I  am  also  indebted  to  Mr.  M.  M.  Saxton,  to  whom  the  entire  manuscript <br/>was  first  dictated  and  to  whom  was  also  entrusted  the  preparation  of  the  index.  The  splendid  efforts <br/>of  Mr.  J.  Augustus  Knapp,  the  illustrator,  have  resulted  in  a  series  of  color  plates  which  add  materially <br/>to  the  beauty  and  completeness  of  the  work.  Q  The  printing  of  the  book  was  in  the  hands  of  Mr. <br/>Frederick  E.  Keast,  of  H.  S.  Crocker  Company,  Inc.,  whose  great  personal  interest  in  the  volume  has <br/>been  manifested  by  an  untiring  effort  to  improve  the  quality  thereof  Through  the  gracious <br/>cooperation  of  Dr.  John  Henry  Nash,  the  foremost  designer  of  printing  on  the  American  Continent, <br/>the  book  appears  in  a  unique  and  appropriate  form,  embodying  the  finest  elements  of  the  printer's <br/>craft.  An  increase  in  the  number  of  plates  and  also  a  finer  quality  of  workmanship  than  was  first <br/>contemplated  have  been  made  possible  by  Mr.  C.  E.  Benson,  of  the  Los  Angeles  Engraving  Company, <br/>who  entered  heart  and  soul  into  the  production  of  this  volume. <br/><br/>The  pre-publication  sale  of  this  book  has  been  without  known  precedent  in  book  history.  The <br/>subscription  list  for  the  first  edition  of  550  copies  was  entirely  closed  a  year  before  the  manuscript <br/>was  placed  in  the  printer's  hands.  The  second,  or  King  Solomon,  edition,  consisting  of  550  copies,  and <br/>the  third,  or  Theosophical,  edition,  consisting  of  200  copies,  were  sold  before  the  finished  volume  was <br/>received  from  the  printer.  For  so  ambitious  a  production,  this  constitutes  a  unique  achievement.  The <br/>credit  for  this  extraordinary  sales  program  belongs  to  Mrs.  Maud  F.  Galigher,  who  had  as  her  ideal <br/>not  to  sell  the  book  in  the  commercial  sense  of  the  word  but  to  place  it  in  the  hands  of  those <br/>particularly  interested  in  the  subject  matter  it  contains.  Valuable  assistance  in  this  respect  was  also <br/>rendered  by  numerous  friends  who  had  attended  my  lectures  and  who  without  compensation <br/>undertook  and  successfully  accomplished  the  distribution  of  the  book. <br/><br/>In  conclusion,  the  author  wishes  to  acknowledge  gratefully  his  indebtedness  to  each  one  of  the <br/>hundreds  of  subscribers  through  whose  advance  payments  the  publication  of  this  folio  was  made <br/>possible.  To  undertake  the  enormous  expense  involved  was  entirely  beyond  his  individual  means  and <br/>those  who  invested  in  the  volume  had  no  assurance  of  its  production  and  no  security  other  than  their <br/>faith  in  the  integrity  of  the  writer. <br/><br/>I  sincerely  hope  that  each  reader  will  profit  from  the  perusal  of  this  book,  even  as  I  have  profited  from <br/>the  writing  of  it.  The  years  of  labor  and  thought  expended  upon  it  have  meant  much  to  me.  The <br/>research  work  discovered  to  me  many  great  truths;  the  writing  of  it  discovered  to  me  the  laws  of  order <br/>and  patience;  the  printing  of  it  discovered  to  me  new  wonders  of  the  arts  and  crafts;  and  the  whole <br/>enterprise  has  discovered  to  me  a  multitude  of  friends  whom  otherwise  I  might  never  have  known. <br/>And  so,  in  the  words  of  John  Bunyan: <br/><br/><br/>Ipenned <br/>It  down,  until  at  last  it  came  to  be, <br/>For  length  and  breadth,  the  bigness  which  you  see. <br/><br/>MANLY  P.

The  superiority  of  any  state  or  substance  over <br/>another  is  determined  by  philosophy.  By  assigning  a  position  of  primary  importance  to  what  remains <br/>when  all  that  is  secondary  has  been  removed,  philosophy  thus  becomes  the  true  index  of  priority  or <br/>emphasis  in  the  realm  of  speculative  thought.  The  mission  of  philosophy  a  priori  is  to  establish  the <br/>relation  of  manifested  things  to  their  invisible  ultimate  cause  or  nature. <br/><br/>&quot;Philosophy,&quot;  writes  Sir  William  Hamilton,  &quot;has  been  defined  [as]:  The  science  of  things  divine  and <br/>human,  and  of  the  causes  in  which  they  are  contained  [Cicero];  The  science  of  effects  by  their  causes <br/>[Hobbes];  The  science  of  sufficient  reasons  [Leibnitz];  The  science  of  things  possible,  inasmuch  as <br/>they  are  possible  [Wolf];  The  science  of  things  evidently  deduced  from  first  principles  [Descartes]; <br/>The  science  of  truths,  sensible  and  abstract  [de  Condillac];  The  application  of  reason  to  its  legitimate <br/>objects  [Tennemann];  The  science  of  the  relations  of  all  knowledge  to  the  necessary  ends  of  human <br/>reason  [Kant];The  science  of  the  original  form  of  the  ego  or  mental  self  [Krug];  The  science  of <br/>sciences  [Fichte];  The  science  of  the  absolute  [von  Schelling];  The  science  of  the  absolute  indifference <br/>of  the  ideal  and  real  [von  Schelling] &#x2014;or.  The  identity  of  identity  and  non-identity  [Hegel].&quot;  (See <br/>Lectures  on  Metaphysics  and  Logic.) <br/><br/>The  six  headings  under  which  the  disciplines  of  philosophy  are  commonly  classified  are:  metaphysics, <br/>which  deals  v^th  such  abstract  subjects  as  cosmology,  theology,  and  the  nature  of  being;  logic,  which <br/>deals  with  the  laws  governing  rational  thinking,  or,  as  it  has  been  called,  &quot;the  doctrine  of  fallacies&quot;; <br/>ethics,  which  is  the  science  of  morality,  individual  responsibility,  and  character&#x2014; concerned  chiefly <br/>with  an  effort  to  determine  the  nature  of  good;  psychology,  which  is  devoted  to  investigation  and <br/>classification  of  those  forms  of  phenomena  referable  to  a  mental  origin;  epistemology,  which  is  the <br/>science  concerned  primarily  with  the  nature  of  knowledge  itself  and  the  question  of  whether  it  may <br/>exist  in  an  absolute  form;  and  aesthetics,  which  is  the  science  of  the  nature  of  and  the  reactions <br/>awakened  by  the  beautiful,  the  harmonious,  the  elegant,  and  the  noble. <br/><br/>Plato  regarded  philosophy  as  the  greatest  good  ever  imparted  by  Divinity  to  man.  In  the  twentieth <br/>century,  however,  it  has  become  a  ponderous  and  complicated  structure  of  arbitrary  and <br/>irreconcilable  notions&#x2014;yet  each  substantiated  by  almost  incontestible  logic.  The  lofty  theorems  of  the <br/>old  Academy  which  lamblichus  likened  to  the  nectar  and  ambrosia  of  the  gods  have  been  so <br/>adulterated  by  opinion&#x2014;which  Heraclitus  declared  to  be  a  falling  sickness  of  the  mind&#x2014; that  the <br/>heavenly  mead  would  now  be  quite  unrecognizable  to  this  great  Neo-Platonist.  Convincing  evidence <br/>of  the  increasing  superficiality  of  modern  scientific  and  philosophic  thought  is  its  persistent  drift <br/>towards  materialism.  When  the  great  astronomer  Laplace  was  asked  by  Napoleon  why  he  had  not <br/>mentioned  God  in  his  Traite  de  la  Mecanique  Celeste,  the  mathematician  naively  replied:  &quot;Sire,  I  had <br/>no  need  for  that  hypothesis!&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  treatise  on  Atheism,  Sir  Francis  Bacon  tersely  summarizes  the  situation  thus:  &quot;A  little <br/>philosophy  inclineth  man's  mind  to  atheism;  but  depth  in  philosophy  bringeth  men's  minds  about  to <br/>religion.&quot;  The  Metaphysics  of  Aristotle  opens  with  these  words:  &quot;All  men  naturally  desire  to  know.&quot;  To <br/>satisfy  this  common  urge  the  unfolding  human  intellect  has  explored  the  extremities  of  imaginable <br/>space  without  and  the  extremities  of  imaginable  self  within,  seeking  to  estimate  the  relationship <br/>between  the  one  and  the  all;  the  effect  and  the  cause;  Nature  and  the  groundwork  of  Nature;  the  mind <br/>and  the  source  of  the  mind;  the  spirit  and  the  substance  of  the  spirit;  the  illusion  and  the  reality. <br/><br/>An  ancient  philosopher  once  said:  &quot;He  who  has  not  even  a  knowledge  of  common  things  is  a  brute <br/>among  men.  He  who  has  an  accurate  knowledge  of  human  concerns  alone  is  a  man  among  brutes.  But <br/><br/><br/>he  who  knows  all  that  can  be  known  by  intellectual  energy,  is  a  God  among  men.&quot;  Man's  status  in  the <br/><br/>natural  world  is  determined,  therefore,  by  the  quality  of  his  thinking.  He  whose  mind  is  enslaved  to <br/>his  bestial  instincts  is  philosophically  not  superior  to  the  brute-,  he  whose  rational  faculties  ponder <br/>human  affairs  is  a  man;  and  he  whose  intellect  is  elevated  to  the  consideration  of  divine  realities  is <br/>already  a  demigod,  for  his  being  partakes  of  the  luminosity  with  which  his  reason  has  brought  him <br/>into  proximity.  In  his  encomium  of  &quot;the  science  of  sciences&quot;  Cicero  is  led  to  exclaim:  &quot;O  philosophy, <br/>life's  guide!  O  searcher&#x2014; out  of  virtue  and  expeller  of  vices!  What  could  we  and  every  age  of  men  have <br/>been  without  thee?  Thou  hast  produced  cities;  thou  hast  called  men  scattered  about  into  the  social <br/>enjoyment  of  life.&quot; <br/><br/>In  this  age  the  word  philosophy  has  little  meaning  unless  accompanied  by  some  other  qualifying  term. <br/>The  body  of  philosophy  has  been  broken  up  into  numerous  isms  more  or  less  antagonistic,  which <br/>have  become  so  concerned  with  the  effort  to  disprove  each  other's  fallacies  that  the  sublimer  issues  of <br/>divine  order  and  human  destiny  have  suffered  deplorable  neglect.  The  ideal  function  of  philosophy  is <br/>to  serve  as  the  stabilizing  influence  in  human  thought.  By  virtue  of  its  intrinsic  nature  it  should <br/>prevent  man  from  ever  establishing  unreasonable  codes  of  life.  Philosophers  themselves,  however, <br/>have  frustrated  the  ends  of  philosophy  by  exceeding  in  their  woolgathering  those  untrained  minds <br/>whom  they  are  supposed  to  lead  in  the  straight  and  narrow  path  of  rational  thinking.  To  list  and <br/>classify  any  but  the  more  important  of  the  now  recognized  schools  of  philosophy  is  beyond  the  space <br/>limitations  of  this  volume.  The  vast  area  of  speculation  covered  by  philosophy  will  be  appreciated  best <br/>after  a  brief  consideration  of  a  few  of  the  outstanding  systems  of  philosophic  discipline  which  have <br/>swayed  the  world  of  thought  during  the  last  twenty-six  centuries.  The  Greek  school  of  philosophy  had <br/>its  inception  with  the  seven  immortalized  thinkers  upon  whom  was  first  conferred  the  appellation  of <br/>Sophos,  &quot;the  wise.&quot;  According  to  Diogenes  Laertius,  these  were  Thales,  Solon,  Chilon,  Pittacus,  Bias, <br/>Cleobulus,  and  Periander.  Water  was  conceived  by  Thales  to  be  the  primal  principle  or  element,  upon <br/>which  the  earth  floated  like  a  ship,  and  earthquakes  were  the  result  of  disturbances  in  this  universal <br/>sea.  Since  Thales  was  an  Ionian,  the  school  perpetuating  his  tenets  became  known  as  the  Ionic.  He <br/>died  in  546  B.C.,  and  was  succeeded  by  Anaximander,  who  in  turn  was  followed  by  Anaximenes, <br/>Anaxagoras,  and  Archelaus,  with  whom  the  Ionic  school  ended.  Anaximander,  differing  from  his <br/>master  Thales,  declared  measureless  and  indefinable  infinity  to  be  the  principle  from  which  all  things <br/>were  generated.  Anaximenes  asserted  air  to  be  the  first  element  of  the  universe;  that  souls  and  even <br/>the  Deity  itself  were  composed  of  it. <br/><br/>Anaxagoras  (whose  doctrine  savors  of  atomism)  held  God  to  be  an  infinite  self -moving  mind;  that  this <br/>divine  infinite  Mind,  not <br/><br/><br/>BABBITT'S  ATOM. <br/><br/>From  Babbitt's  Principles  of  Light  and  Color. <br/><br/>Since  the  postulation  of  the  atomic  theory  by  Democritus,  many  efforts  have  been  made  to  determine  the  structure  of <br/>atoms  and  the  method  by  which  they  unite  to  form  various  elements,  Even  science  has  not  refrained  from  entering  this <br/>field  of  speculation  and  presents  for  consideration  most  detailed  and  elaborate  representations  of  these  minute  bodies.  By <br/>far  the  most  remarkable  conception  of  the  atom  evolved  during  the  last  century  is  that  produced  by  the  genius  of  Dr. <br/>Edwin  D.  Babbitt  and  which  is  reproduced  herewith.  The  diagram  is  self-explanatory.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  this <br/>apparently  massive  structure  is  actually  s  minute  as  to  defy  analysis.  Not  only  did  Dr.  Babbitt  create  this  form  of  the  atom <br/>but  he  also  contrived  a  method  whereby  these  particles  could  be  grouped  together  in  an  orderly  manner  and  thus  result  in <br/>the  formation  of  molecular  bodies. <br/><br/>p.  14 <br/><br/>inclosed  in  any  body,  is  the  efficient  cause  of  all  things;  out  of  the  infinite  matter  consisting  of  similar <br/>parts,  everything  being  made  according  to  its  species  by  the  divine  mind,  who  when  all  things  were  at <br/>first  confusedly  mingled  together,  came  and  reduced  them  to  order.&quot;  Archelaus  declared  the  principle <br/>of  all  things  to  be  twofold:  mind  (which  was  incorporeal)  and  air  (which  was  corporeal),  the <br/>rarefaction  and  condensation  of  the  latter  resulting  in  fire  and  water  respectively.  The  stars  were <br/>conceived  by  Archelaus  to  be  burning  iron  places.  Heraclitus  (who  lived  536-470  B.C.  and  is <br/>sometimes  included  in  the  Ionic  school)  in  his  doctrine  of  change  and  eternal  flux  asserted  fire  to  be <br/><br/><br/>the  first  element  and  also  the  state  into  which  the  world  would  ultimately  be  reabsorbed.  The  soul  of <br/>the  world  he  regarded  as  an  exhalation  from  its  humid  parts,  and  he  declared  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the <br/>sea  to  be  caused  by  the  sun. <br/><br/>After  Pjithagoras  of  Samos,  its  founder,  the  Italic  or  Pythagorean  school  numbers  among  its  most <br/>distinguished  representatives  Empedocles,  Epicharmus,  Archytas,  Alcmseon,  Hippasus,  Philolaus, <br/>and  Eudoxus.  Pythagoras  (580-500?  B.C.)  conceived  mathematics  to  be  the  most  sacred  and  exact  of <br/>all  the  sciences,  and  demanded  of  all  who  came  to  him  for  study  a  familiarity  with  arithmetic,  music, <br/>astronomy,  and  geometry.  He  laid  special  emphasis  upon  the  philosophic  life  as  a  prerequisite  to <br/>wisdom.  Pythagoras  was  one  of  the  first  teachers  to  establish  a  community  wherein  all  the  members <br/>were  of  mutual  assistance  to  one  another  in  the  common  attainment  of  the  higher  sciences.  He  also <br/>introduced  the  discipline  of  retrospection  as  essential  to  the  development  of  the  spiritual  mind. <br/>Pjithagoreanism  may  be  summarized  as  a  system  of  metaphysical  speculation  concerning  the <br/>relationships  between  numbers  and  the  causal  agencies  of  existence.  This  school  also  first  expounded <br/>the  theory  of  celestial  harmonics  or  &quot;the  music  of  the  spheres.&quot;  John  Reuchlin  said  of  Pythagoras  that <br/>he  taught  nothing  to  his  disciples  before  the  discipline  of  silence,  silence  being  the  first  rudiment  of <br/>contemplation.  In  his  Sophist,  Aristotle  credits  Empedocles  with  the  discovery  of  rhetoric.  Both <br/>Pythagoras  and  Empedocles  accepted  the  theory  of  transmigration,  the  latter  saying:  &quot;A  boy  I  was, <br/>then  did  a  maid  become;  a  plant,  bird,  fish,  and  in  the  vast  sea  swum.&quot;  Archytas  is  credited  with <br/>invention  of  the  screw  and  the  crane.  Pleasure  he  declared  to  be  a  pestilence  because  it  was  opposed <br/>to  the  temperance  of  the  mind;  he  considered  a  man  without  deceit  to  be  as  rare  as  a  fish  without <br/>bones. <br/><br/>The  Eleatic  sect  was  founded  by  Xenophanes  (570-480  B.C.),  who  was  conspicuous  for  his  attacks <br/>upon  the  cosmologic  and  theogonic  fables  of  Homer  and  Hesiod.  Xenophanes  declared  that  God  was <br/>&quot;one  and  incorporeal,  in  substance  and  figure  round,  in  no  way  resembling  man;  that  He  is  all  sight <br/>and  all  hearing,  but  breathes  not;  that  He  is  all  things,  the  mind  and  wisdom,  not  generate  but  eternal, <br/>impassible,  immutable,  and  rational.&quot;  Xenophanes  believed  that  all  existing  things  were  eternal,  that <br/>the  world  was  without  beginning  or  end,  and  that  everything  which  was  generated  was  subject  to <br/>corruption.  He  lived  to  great  age  and  is  said  to  have  buried  his  sons  with  his  own  hands.  Parmenides <br/>studied  under  Xenophanes,  but  never  entirely  subscribed  to  his  doctrines.  Parmenides  declared  the <br/>senses  to  be  uncertain  and  reason  the  only  criterion  of  truth.  He  first  asserted  the  earth  to  be  round <br/>and  also  divided  its  surface  into  zones  of  hear  and  cold. <br/><br/>Melissus,  who  is  included  in  the  Eleatic  school,  held  many  opinions  in  common  with  Parmenides.  He <br/>declared  the  universe  to  be  immovable  because,  occupying  all  space,  there  was  no  place  to  which  it <br/>could  be  moved.  He  further  rejected  the  theory  of  a  vacuum  in  space.  Zeno  of  Elea  also  maintained <br/>that  a  vacuum  could  not  exist.  Rejecting  the  theory  of  motion,  he  asserted  that  there  was  but  one  God, <br/>who  was  an  eternal,  ungenerated  Being.  Like  Xenophanes,  he  conceived  Deity  to  be  spherical  in  shape. <br/>Leucippus  held  the  Universe  to  consist  of  two  parts:  one  full  and  the  other  a  vacuum.  From  the <br/>Infinite  a  host  of  minute  fragmentary  bodies  descended  into  the  vacuum,  where,  through  continual <br/>agitation,  they  organized  themselves  into  spheres  of  substance. <br/><br/>The  great  Democritus  to  a  certain  degree  enlarged  upon  the  atomic  theory  of  Leucippus.  Democritus <br/>declared  the  principles  of  all  things  to  be  twofold:  atoms  and  vacuum.  Both,  he  asserted,  are  infinite- <br/>atoms  in  number,  vacuum  in  magnitude.  Thus  all  bodies  must  be  composed  of  atoms  or  vacuum. <br/>Atoms  possessed  two  properties,  form  and  size,  both  characterized  by  infinite  variety.  The  soul <br/>Democritus  also  conceived  to  be  atomic  in  structure  and  subject  to  dissolution  with  the  body.  The <br/>mind  he  believed  to  be  composed  of  spiritual  atoms.  Aristotle  intimates  that  Democritus  obtained  his <br/>atomic  theory  from  the  Pythagorean  doctrine  of  the  Monad.  Among  the  Eleatics  are  also  included <br/>Protagoras  and  Anaxarchus. <br/><br/><br/>Socrates  (469-399  B.C.),  the  founder  of  the  Socratic  sect,  being  fundamentally  a  Skeptic,  did  not  force <br/>his  opinions  upon  others,  but  through  the  medium  of  questionings  caused  each  man  to  give <br/>expression  to  his  own  philosophy.  According  to  Plutarch,  Socrates  conceived  every  place  as <br/>appropriate  for  reaching  in  that  the  whole  world  was  a  school  of  virtue.  He  held  that  the  soul  existed <br/>before  the  body  and,  prior  to  immersion  therein,  was  endowed  with  all  knowledge;  that  when  the  soul <br/>entered  into  the  material  form  it  became  stupefied,  but  that  by  discourses  upon  sensible  objects  it  was <br/>caused  to  reawaken  and  to  recover  its  original  knowledge.  On  these  premises  was  based  his  attempt <br/>to  stimulate  the  soul-power  through  irony  and  inductive  reasoning.  It  has  been  said  of  Socrates  that <br/>the  sole  subject  of  his  philosophy  was  man.  He  himself  declared  philosophy  to  be  the  way  of  true <br/>happiness  and  its  purpose  twofold:  (1)  to  contemplate  God,  and  (2)  to  abstract  the  soul  from <br/>corporeal  sense. <br/><br/>The  principles  of  all  things  he  conceived  to  be  three  in  number:  God,  matter,  and  ideas.  Of  God  he <br/>said:  &quot;What  He  is  I  know  not;  what  He  is  not  I  know.&quot;  Matter  he  defined  as  the  subject  of  generation <br/>and  corruption;  idea,  as  an  incorruptible  substance&#x2014;the  intellect  of  God.  Wisdom  he  considered  the <br/>sum  of  the  virtues.  Among  the  prominent  members  of  the  Socratic  sect  were  Xenophon,  ^Eschines, <br/>Crito,  Simon,  Glauco,  Simmias,  and  Cebes.  Professor  Zeller,  the  great  authority  on  ancient <br/>philosophies,  has  recently  declared  the  writings  of  Xenophon  relating  to  Socrates  to  be  forgeries. <br/>When  The  Clouds  of  Aristophanes,  a  comedy  written  to  ridicule  the  theories  of  Socrates,  was  first <br/>presented,  the  great  Skeptic  himself  attended  the  play.  During  the  performance,  which  caricatured <br/>him  seated  in  a  basket  high  in  the  air  studying  the  sun,  Socrates  rose  calmly  in  his  seat,  the  better  to <br/>enable  the  Athenian  spectators  to  compare  his  own  unprepossessing  features  with  the  grotesque <br/>mask  worn  by  the  actor  impersonating  him. <br/><br/>The  Elean  sect  was  founded  by  Phaedo  of  Elis,  a  youth  of  noble  family,  who  was  bought  from  slavery <br/>at  the  instigation  of  Socrates  and  who  became  his  devoted  disciple.  Plato  so  highly  admired  Phaedo's <br/>mentality  that  he  named  one  of  the  most  famous  of  his  discourses  The  Phaedo.  Phaedo  was  succeeded <br/>in  his  school  by  Plisthenes,  who  in  turn  was  followed  by  Menedemus.  Of  the  doctrines  of  the  Elean <br/>sect  little  is  known.  Menedemus  is  presumed  to  have  been  inclined  toward  the  teachings  of  Stilpo  and <br/>the  Megarian  sect.  When  Menedemus'  opinions  were  demanded,  he  answered  that  he  was  free,  thus <br/>intimating  that  most  men  were  enslaved  to  their  opinions.  Menedemus  was  apparently  of  a  somewhat <br/>belligerent  temperament  and  often  returned  from  his  lectures  in  a  badly  bruised  condition.  The  most <br/>famous  of  his  propositions  is  stated  thus:  That  which  is  not  the  same  is  different  from  that  with  which <br/>it  is  not  the  same.  This  point  being  admitted,  Menedemus  continued:  To  benefit  is  not  the  same  as <br/>good,  therefore  good  does  not  benefit.  After  the  time  of  Menedemus  the  Elean  sect  became  known  as <br/>the  Eretrian.  Its  exponents  denounced  all  negative  propositions  and  all  complex  and  abstruse  theories, <br/>declaring  that  only  affirmative  and  simple  doctrines  could  be  true. <br/><br/>The  Megarian  sect  was  founded  by  Euclid  of  Megara  (not  the  celebrated  mathematician),  a  great <br/>admirer  of  Socrates.  The  Athenians  passed  a  law  decreeing  death  to  any  citizen  of  Megara  found  in <br/>the  city  of  Athens.  Nothing  daunted,  Euclid  donned  woman's  clothing  and  went  at  night  to  study  with <br/>Socrates.  After  the  cruel  death  of  their  teacher,  the  disciples  of  Socrates,  fearing  a  similar  fate,  fled  to <br/>Megara,  where  they  were  entertained  with  great  honor  by  Euclid.  The  Megarian  school  accepted  the <br/>Socratic  doctrine  that  virtue  is  wisdom,  adding  to  it  the  Eleatic  concept  that  goodness  is  absolute <br/>unity  and  all  change  an  illusion  of  the  senses.  Euclid  maintained  that  good  has  no  opposite  and <br/>therefore  evil  does  not  exist.  Being  asked  about  the  nature  of  the  gods,  he  declared  himself  ignorant  of <br/>their  disposition  save  that  they  hated  curious  persons. <br/><br/>The  Megarians  are  occasionally  included  among  the  dialectic  philosophers.  Euclid  (who  died  374? <br/>B.C.)  was  succeeded  in  his  school  by  Eubulides,  among  whose  disciples  were  Alexinus  and  Apollonius <br/>Cronus.  Euphantus,  who  lived  to  great  age  and  wrote  many  tragedies,  was  among  the  foremost <br/>followers  of  Eubulides.  Diodorus  is  usually  included  in  the  Megarian  school,  having  heard  Eubulides <br/><br/><br/>lecture.  According  to  legend,  Diodorus  died  of  grief  because  he  could  not  answer  instantly  certain <br/>questions  asked  him  by  Stilpo,  at  one  time  master  of  the  Megarian  school.  Diodorus  held  that  nothing <br/><br/><br/>PLATO. <br/><br/><br/>From  Thomasin's  Recuil  des  Figures,  Groupes,  Thermes,  Fontaines,  Vases  et  autres  Ornaments. <br/><br/>Plato's  real  name  was  Aristocles.  When  his  father  brought  him  to  study  with  Socrates,  the  great  Skeptic  declared  that  on <br/>the  previous  night  he  had  dreamed  of  a  white  swan,  which  was  an  omen  that  his  new  disciple  was  to  become  one  of  the <br/>world's  illumined.  There  is  a  tradition  that  the  immortal  Plato  was  sold  as  a  slave  by  the  King  of  Sicily. <br/><br/>p-15 <br/><br/>can  be  moved,  since  to  be  moved  it  must  be  taken  out  of  the  place  in  which  it  is  and  put  into  the  place <br/>where  it  is  not,  which  is  impossible  because  all  things  must  always  be  in  the  places  where  they  are. <br/><br/>The  Cynics  were  a  sect  founded  by  Antisthenes  of  Athens  (444-365?  B.C.),  a  disciple  of  Socrates. <br/>Their  doctrine  may  be  described  as  an  extreme  individualism  which  considers  man  as  existing  for <br/>himself  alone  and  advocates  surrounding  him  by  inharmony,  suffering,  and  direst  need  that  be  may <br/>thereby  be  driven  to  retire  more  completely  into  his  own  nature.  The  Cynics  renounced  all  worldly <br/>possessions,  living  in  the  rudest  shelters  and  subsisting  upon  the  coarsest  and  simplest  food.  On  the <br/>assumption  that  the  gods  wanted  nothing,  the  Cynics  affirmed  that  those  whose  needs  were  fewest <br/>consequently  approached  closest  to  the  divinities.  Being  asked  what  he  gained  by  a  life  of  philosophy, <br/>Antisthenes  replied  that  he  had  learned  how  to  converse  with  himself. <br/><br/>Diogenes  of  Sinopis  is  remembered  chiefly  for  the  tub  in  the  Metroum  which  for  many  years  served <br/>him  as  a  home.  The  people  of  Athens  loved  the  beggar-philosopher,  and  when  a  youth  in  jest  bored <br/>holes  in  the  tub,  the  city  presented  Diogenes  with  a  new  one  and  punished  the  youth.  Diogenes <br/>believed  that  nothing  in  life  can  be  rightly  accomplished  without  exercitation.  He  maintained  that <br/>everything  in  the  world  belongs  to  the  wise,  a  declaration  which  he  proved  by  the  following  logic:  &quot;All <br/>things  belong  to  the  gods;  the  gods  are  friends  to  wise  persons;  all  things  are  common  amongst <br/><br/><br/>friends;  therefore  all  things  belong  to  the  wise.&quot;  Among  the  Cynics  are  Monimus,  Onesicritus,  Crates, <br/>Metrocles,  Hipparchia  (who  married  Crates),  Menippus,  and  Menedemus. <br/><br/>The  Cyrenaic  sect,  founded  by  Aristippus  of  Cyrene  (435-356?  B.C.),  promulgated  the  doctrine  of <br/>hedonism.  Learning  of  the  fame  of  Socrates,  Aristippus  journeyed  to  Athens  and  applied  himself  to <br/>the  teachings  of  the  great  Skeptic.  Socrates,  pained  by  the  voluptuous  and  mercenary  tendencies  of <br/>Aristippus,  vainly  labored  to  reform  the  young  man.  Aristippus  has  the  distinction  of  being  consistent <br/>in  principle  and  practice,  for  he  lived  in  perfect  harmony  with  his  philosophy  that  the  quest  of <br/>pleasure  was  the  chief  purpose  of  life.  The  doctrines  of  the  Cyrenaics  maybe  summarized  thus:  All <br/>that  is  actually  known  concerning  any  object  or  condition  is  the  feeling  which  it  awakens  in  man's <br/>own  nature.  In  the  sphere  of  ethics  that  which  awakens  the  most  pleasant  feeling  is  consequently  to <br/>be  esteemed  as  the  greatest  good.  Emotional  reactions  are  classified  as  pleasant  or  gentle,  harsh,  and <br/>mean.  The  end  of  pleasant  emotion  is  pleasure;  the  end  of  harsh  emotion,  grief;  the  end  of  mean <br/>emotion,  nothing. <br/><br/>Through  mental  perversity  some  men  do  not  desire  pleasure.  In  reality,  however,  pleasure  (especially <br/>of  a  physical  nature)  is  the  true  end  of  existence  and  exceeds  in  every  way  mental  and  spiritual <br/>enjoyments.  Pleasure,  furthermore,  is  limited  wholly  to  the  moment;  now  is  the  only  time.  The  past <br/>cannot  be  regarded  without  regret  and  the  future  cannot  be  faced  without  misgiving;  therefore <br/>neither  is  conducive  to  pleasure.  No  man  should  grieve,  for  grief  is  the  most  serious  of  all  diseases. <br/>Nature  permits  man  to  do  anything  he  desires;  he  is  limited  only  by  his  own  laws  and  customs.  A <br/>philosopher  is  one  free  from  envy,  love,  and  superstition,  and  whose  days  are  one  long  round  of <br/>pleasure.  Indulgence  was  thus  elevated  by  Aristippus  to  the  chief  position  among  the  virtues.  He <br/>further  declared  philosophers  to  differ  markedly  from  other  men  in  that  they  alone  would  not  change <br/>the  order  of  their  lives  if  all  the  laws  of  men  were  abolished.  Among  prominent  philosophers <br/>influenced  by  the  Cyrenaic  doctrines  were  Hegesias,  Anniceris,  Theodoras,  and  Bion. <br/><br/>The  sect  of  the  Academic  philosophers  instituted  by  Plato  (427-347  B.C.)  was  divided  into  three  major <br/>parts&#x2014;the  old,  the  middle,  and  the  new  Academy.  Among  the  old  Academics  were  Speusippus, <br/>Zenocrates,  Poleman,  Crates,  and  Crantor.  Arcesilaus  instituted  the  middle  Academy  and  Carneades <br/>founded  the  new.  Chief  among  the  masters  of  Plato  was  Socrates.  Plato  traveled  widely  and  was <br/>initiated  by  the  Egyptians  into  the  profundities  of  Hermetic  philosophy.  He  also  derived  much  from <br/>the  doctrines  of  the  Pj^hagoreans.  Cicero  describes  the  threefold  constitution  of  Platonic  philosophy <br/>as  comprising  ethics,  physics,  and  dialectics.  Plato  defined  good  as  threefold  in  character:  good  in  the <br/>soul,  expressed  through  the  virtues;  good  in  the  body,  expressed  through  the  symmetry  and <br/>endurance  of  the  parts;  and  good  in  the  external  world,  expressed  through  social  position  and <br/>companionship.  In  The  Book  of  Speusippus  on  Platonic  Definitions,  that  great  Platonist  thus  defines <br/>God:  &quot;A  being  that  lives  immortally  by  means  of  Himself  alone,  sufficing  for  His  own  blessedness,  the <br/>eternal  Essence,  cause  of  His  own  goodness.  According  to  Plato,  the  One  is  the  term  most  suitable  for <br/>defining  the  Absolute,  since  the  whole  precedes  the  parts  and  diversity  is  dependent  on  unity,  but <br/>unity  not  on  diversity.  The  One,  moreover,  is  before  being,  for  to  be  is  an  attribute  or  condition  of  the <br/>One. <br/><br/>Platonic  philosophy  is  based  upon  the  postulation  of  three  orders  of  being:  that  which  moves <br/>unmoved,  that  which  is  self -moved,  and  that  which  is  moved.  That  which  is  immovable  but  moves  is <br/>anterior  to  that  which  is  self-moved,  which  likewise  is  anterior  to  that  which  it  moves.  That  in  which <br/>motion  is  inherent  cannot  be  separated  from  its  motive  power;  it  is  therefore  incapable  of  dissolution. <br/>Of  such  nature  are  the  immortals.  That  which  has  motion  imparted  to  it  from  another  can  be <br/>separated  from  the  source  of  its  an  animating  principle;  it  is  therefore  subject  to  dissolution.  Of  such <br/>nature  are  mortal  beings.  Superior  to  both  the  mortals  and  the  immortals  is  that  condition  which <br/>continually  moves  yet  itself  is  unmoved.  To  this  constitution  the  power  of  abidance  is  inherent;  it  is <br/>therefore  the  Divine  Permanence  upon  which  all  things  are  established.  Being  nobler  even  than  self- <br/>motion,  the  unmoved  Mover  is  the  first  of  all  dignities.  The  Platonic  discipline  was  founded  upon  the <br/><br/><br/>theory  that  learning  is  really  reminiscence,  or  the  bringing  into  objectivity  of  knowledge  formerly <br/>acquired  by  the  soul  in  a  previous  state  of  existence.  At  the  entrance  of  the  Platonic  school  in  the <br/>Academy  were  written  the  words:  &quot;Let  none  ignorant  of  geometry  enter  here.&quot; <br/><br/>After  the  death  of  Plato,  his  disciples  separated  into  two  groups.  One,  the  Academics,  continued  to <br/>meet  in  the  Academy  where  once  he  had  presided;  the  other,  the  Peripatetics,  removed  to  the  Lyceum <br/>under  the  leadership  of  Aristotle  (384-322  B.C.).  Plato  recognized  Aristotle  as  his  greatest  disciple <br/>and,  according  to  Philoponus,  referred  to  him  as  &quot;the  mind  of  the  school.&quot;  If  Aristotle  were  absent <br/>from  the  lectures,  Plato  would  say:  &quot;The  intellect  is  not  here.&quot;  Of  the  prodigious  genius  of  Aristotle, <br/>Thomas  Taylor  writes  in  his  introduction  to  The  Metaphysics: <br/><br/>&quot;When  we  consider  that  he  was  not  only  well  acquainted  with  every  science,  as  his  works  abundantly <br/>evince,  but  that  he  wrote  on  almost  every  subject  which  is  comprehended  in  the  circle  of  human <br/>knowledge,  and  this  with  matchless  accuracy  and  skill,  we  know  not  which  to  admire  most,  the <br/>penetration  or  extent  of  his  mind.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  PROBLEM  OF  DIVERSITY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  Ars  Magna  Sciendi. <br/><br/>In  the  above  diagram  Kircher  arranges  eighteen  objects  in  two  vertical  columns  and  then  determines  he  number  of <br/>arrangements  in  which  they  can  be  combined.  By  the  same  method  Kircher  further  estimates  that  fifty  objects  may  be <br/>arranged  in  1,273,726,838,815,420,339,851,343,083,767,005,515,293,749,454,795,408,000,000,000,000  combinations. <br/>From  this  it  will  be  evident  that  infinite  diversity  is  possible,  for  the  countless  parts  of  the  universe  may  be  related  to  each <br/>other  in  an  incalculable  number  of  ways;  and  through  the  various  combinations  of  these  limitless  subdivisions  of  being. <br/><br/><br/>infinite  individuality  and  infinite  variety  must  inevitably  result.  Thus  it  is  fiirther  evident  that  life  can  never  become <br/>monotonous  or  exhaust  the  possibilities  of  variety. <br/><br/>p.  16 <br/><br/>Of  the  philosophy  of  Aristotle,  the  same  author  says:  &quot;The  end  of  Aristotle's  moral  philosophy  is <br/>perfection  through  the  virtues,  and  the  end  of  his  contemplative  philosophy  an  union  with  the  one <br/>principle  of  all  things.&quot; <br/><br/>Aristotle  conceived  philosophy  to  be  twofold:  practical  and  theoretical.  Practical  philosophy <br/>embraced  ethics  and  politics;  theoretical  philosophy,  physics  and  logic.  Metaphysics  he  considered  to <br/>be  the  science  concerning  that  substance  which  has  the  principle  of  motion  and  rest  inherent  to  itself. <br/>To  Aristotle  the  soul  is  that  by  which  man  first  lives,  feels,  and  understands.  Hence  to  the  soul  he <br/>assigned  three  faculties:  nutritive,  sensitive,  and  intellective.  He  further  considered  the  soul  to  be <br/>twofold&#x2014;rational  and  irrational&#x2014;and  in  some  particulars  elevated  the  sense  perceptions  above  the <br/>mind.  Aristotle  defined  wisdom  as  the  science  of  first  Causes.  The  four  major  divisions  of  his <br/>philosophy  are  dialectics,  physics,  ethics,  and  metaphysics.  God  is  defined  as  the  First  Mover,  the  Best <br/>of  beings,  an  immovable  Substance,  separate  from  sensible  things,  void  of  corporeal  quantity,  without <br/>parts  and  indivisible.  Platonism  is  based  upon  a  priori  reasoning;  Aristotelianism  upon  a  posteriori <br/>reasoning.  Aristotle  taught  his  pupil,  Alexander  the  Great,  to  feel  that  if  he  had  not  done  a  good  deed <br/>he  had  not  reigned  that  day.  Among  his  followers  were  Theophrastus,  Strato,  Lyco,  Aristo,  Critolaus, <br/>and  Diodorus. <br/><br/>Of  Skepticism  as  propounded  by  Pyrrho  of  Elis  (365-275  B.C.)  and  by  Timon,  Sextus  Empiricus  said <br/>that  those  who  seek  must  find  or  deny  they  have  found  or  can  find,  or  persevere  in  the  inquiry.  Those <br/>who  suppose  they  have  found  truth  are  called  Dogmatists;  those  who  think  it  incomprehensible  are <br/>the  Academics;  those  who  still  seek  are  the  Skeptics.  The  attitude  of  Skepticism  towards  the  knowable <br/>is  summed  up  by  Sextus  Empiricus  in  the  following  words:  &quot;But  the  chief  ground  of  Skepticism  is  that <br/>to  every  reason  there  is  an  opposite  reason  equivalent,  which  makes  us  forbear  to  dogmatize.&quot;  The <br/>Skeptics  were  strongly  opposed  to  the  Dogmatists  and  were  agnostic  in  that  they  held  the  accepted <br/>theories  regarding  Deity  to  be  self-contradictory  and  undemonstrable.  &quot;How,&quot;  asked  the  Skeptic,  &quot;can <br/>we  have  indubitate  knowledge  of  God,  knowing  not  His  substance,  form  or  place;  for,  while <br/>philosophers  disagree  irreconcilably  on  these  points,  their  conclusions  cannot  be  considered  as <br/>undoubtedly  true?&quot;  Since  absolute  knowledge  was  considered  unattainable,  the  Skeptics  declared  the <br/>end  of  their  discipline  to  be:  &quot;In  opinionatives,  indisturbance;  in  impulsives,  moderation;  and  in <br/>disquietives,  suspension.&quot; <br/><br/>The  sect  of  the  Stoics  was  founded  by  Zeno  (340-265  B.C.),  the  Cittiean,  who  studied  under  Crates  the <br/>Cynic,  from  which  sect  the  Stoics  had  their  origin.  Zeno  was  succeeded  by  Cleanthes,  Chrysippus, <br/>Zeno  of  Tarsis,  Diogenes,  Antipater,  Panaetius,  and  Posidonius.  Most  famous  of  the  Roman  Stoics  are <br/>Epictetus  and  Marcus  Aurelius.  The  Stoics  were  essentially  pantheists,  since  they  maintained  that  as <br/>there  is  nothing  better  than  the  world,  the  world  is  God.  Zeno  declared  that  the  reason  of  the  world  is <br/>diffused  throughout  it  as  seed.  Stoicism  is  a  materialistic  philosophy,  enjoining  voluntary  resignation <br/>to  natural  law.  Chrysippus  maintained  that  good  and  evil  being  contrary,  both  are  necessary  since <br/>each  sustains  the  other.  The  soul  was  regarded  as  a  body  distributed  throughout  the  physical  form <br/>and  subject  to  dissolution  with  it.  Though  some  of  the  Stoics  held  that  wisdom  prolonged  the <br/>existence  of  the  soul,  actual  immortality  is  not  included  in  their  tenets.  The  soul  was  said  to  be <br/>composed  of  eight  parts:  the  five  senses,  the  generative  power,  the  vocal  power,  and  an  eighth,  or <br/>hegemonic,  part.  Nature  was  defined  as  God  mixed  throughout  the  substance  of  the  world.  All  things <br/>were  looked  upon  as  bodies  either  corporeal  or  incorporeal. <br/><br/>Meekness  marked  the  attitude  of  the  Stoic  philosopher.  While  Diogenes  was  delivering  a  discourse <br/>against  anger,  one  of  his  listeners  spat  contemptuously  in  his  face.  Receiving  the  insult  with  humility. <br/><br/><br/>the  great  Stoic  was  moved  to  retort:  &quot;I  am  not  angry,  but  am  in  doubt  whether  I  ought  to  be  so  or <br/>not!&quot; <br/><br/>Epicurus  of  Samos  (341-270  B.C.)  was  the  founder  of  the  Epicurean  sect,  which  in  many  respects <br/>resembles  the  Cyrenaic  but  is  higher  in  its  ethical  standards.  The  Epicureans  also  posited  pleasure  as <br/>the  most  desirable  state,  but  conceived  it  to  be  a  grave  and  dignified  state  achieved  through <br/>renunciation  of  those  mental  and  emotional  inconstancies  which  are  productive  of  pain  and  sorrow. <br/>Epicurus  held  that  as  the  pains  of  the  mind  and  soul  are  more  grievous  than  those  of  the  body,  so  the <br/>joys  of  the  mind  and  soul  exceed  those  of  the  body.  The  Cyrenaics  asserted  pleasure  to  be  dependent <br/>upon  action  or  motion;  the  Epicureans  claimed  rest  or  lack  of  action  to  be  equally  productive  of <br/>pleasure.  Epicurus  accepted  the  philosophy  of  Democritus  concerning  the  nature  of  atoms  and  based <br/>his  physics  upon  this  theory.  The  Epicurean  philosophy  may  be  summed  up  in  four  canons: <br/><br/>&quot;(1)  Sense  is  never  deceived;  and  therefore  every  sensation  and  every  perception  of  an  appearance  is <br/>true.  (2)  Opinion  follows  upon  sense  and  is  superadded  to  sensation,  and  capable  of  truth  or <br/>falsehood,  (3)  All  opinion  attested,  or  not  contradicted  by  the  evidence  of  sense,  is  true.  (4)  An <br/>opinion  contradicted,  or  not  attested  by  the  evidence  of  sense,  is  false.&quot;  Among  the  Epicureans  of  note <br/>were  Metrodorus  of  Lampsacus,  Zeno  of  Sidon,  and  Phaedrus. <br/><br/>Eclecticism  may  be  defined  as  the  practice  of  choosing  apparently  irreconcilable  doctrines  from <br/>antagonistic  schools  and  constructing  therefrom  a  composite  philosophic  system  in  harmony  with  the <br/>convictions  of  the  eclectic  himself.  Eclecticism  can  scarcely  be  considered  philosophically  or  logically <br/>sound,  for  as  individual  schools  arrive  at  their  conclusions  by  different  methods  of  reasoning,  so  the <br/>philosophic  product  of  fragments  from  these  schools  must  necessarily  be  built  upon  the  foundation  of <br/>conflicting  premises.  Eclecticism,  accordingly,  has  been  designated  the  layman's  cult.  In  the  Roman <br/>Empire  little  thought  was  devoted  to  philosophic  theory;  consequently  most  of  its  thinkers  were  of  the <br/>eclectic  type.  Cicero  is  the  outstanding  example  of  early  Eclecticism,  for  his  writings  are  a  veritable <br/>potpourri  of  invaluable  fragments  from  earlier  schools  of  thought.  Eclecticism  appears  to  have  had  its <br/>inception  at  the  moment  when  men  first  doubted  the  possibility  of  discovering  ultimate  truth. <br/>Observing  all  so-called  knowledge  to  be  mere  opinion  at  best,  the  less  studious  furthermore <br/>concluded  that  the  wiser  course  to  pursue  was  to  accept  that  which  appeared  to  be  the  most <br/>reasonable  of  the  teachings  of  any  school  or  individual.  From  this  practice,  however,  arose  a  pseudo- <br/>broadmindedness  devoid  of  the  element  of  preciseness  found  in  true  logic  and  philosophy. <br/><br/>The  Neo-Pythagorean  school  flourished  in  Alexandria  during  the  first  century  of  the  Christian  Era. <br/>Only  two  names  stand  out  in  connection  with  it~Apollonius  of  Tyana  and  Moderatus  of  Gades.  Neo- <br/>Pythagoreanism  is  a  link  between  the  older  pagan  philosophies  and  Neo-Platonism.  Like  the  former, <br/>it  contained  many  exact  elements  of  thought  derived  from  Pythagoras  and  Plato;  like  the  latter,  it <br/>emphasized  metaphysical  speculation  and  ascetic  habits.  A  striking  similarity  has  been  observed  by <br/>several  authors  between  Neo-Pythagoreanism  and  the  doctrines  of  the  Essenes.  Special  emphasis  was <br/>laid  upon  the  mystery  of  numbers,  and  it  is  possible  that  the  Neo-Pythagoreans  had  a  far  wider <br/>knowledge  of  the  true  teachings  of  Pythagoras  than  is  available  today.  Even  in  the  first  century <br/>Pythagoras  was  regarded  more  as  a  god  than  a  man,  and  the  revival  of  his  philosophy  was  resorted  to <br/>apparently  in  the  hope  that  his  name  would  stimulate  interest  in  the  deeper  systems  of  learning.  But <br/>Greek  philosophy  had  passed  the  zenith  of  its  splendor;  the  mass  of  humanity  was  awakening  to  the <br/>importance  of  physical  life  and  physical  phenomena.  The  emphasis  upon  earthly  affairs  which  began <br/>to  assert  itself  later  reached  maturity  of  expression  in  twentieth  century  materialism  and <br/>commercialism. <br/><br/><br/>^NEAS  AT  THE  GATE  OF  HELL. <br/><br/><br/>From  Virgil's  ^neid.  (Dryden's  translation.) <br/><br/>Virgil  describes  part  of  the  ritual  of  a  Greek  Mystery&#x2014;possibly  the  Eleusinian~in  his  account  of  the  descent  of  ^neas,  to <br/>the  gate  of  hell  under  the  guidance  of  the  Sibyl.  Of  that  part  of  the  ritual  portrayed  above  the  immortal  poet  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;Full  in  the  midst  of  this  infernal  Road, <br/>An  Elm  displays  her  dusky  Arms  abroad; <br/>The  God  of  Sleep  there  hides  his  heavy  Head <br/>And  empty  Dreams  on  ev'ry  Leaf  are  spread. <br/>Of  various  Forms,  unnumber'd  Specters  more; <br/>Centaurs,  and  double  Shapes,  besiege  the  Door: <br/>Before  the  Passage  horrid  Hydra  stands. <br/>And  Briareus  with  all  his  hundred  Hands: <br/>Gorgons,  Geryon  with  his  triple  Frame; <br/>And  vain  Chimsera  vomits  empty  Flame. <br/>The  Chief  unsheath'd  his  shining  Steel,  prepar'd, <br/>Tho  seiz'd  with  sudden  Fear,  to  force  the  Guard. <br/>Off  ring  his  brandish'd  Weapon  at  their  Face, <br/>Had  not  the  Sibyl  stop'd  his  eager  Pace, <br/>And  told  him  what  those  empty  Phantoms  were; <br/>Forms  without  Bodies,  and  impassive  Air.&quot; <br/><br/>p.  17 <br/><br/>even  though  Neo-Platonism  was  to  intervene  and  many  centuries  pass  before  this  emphasis  took <br/>definite  form. <br/><br/>Although  Ammonius  Saccus  was  long  believed  to  be  the  founder  of  Neo-Platonism,  the  school  had  its <br/>true  beginning  in  Plotinus  (A.D.  204-269?).  Prominent  among  the  Neo-Platonists  of  Alexandria,  Syria, <br/>Rome,  and  Athens  were  Porphyry,  lamblichus,  Sallustius,  the  Emperor  Julian,  Plutarch,  and  Proclus. <br/>Neo-Platonism  was  the  supreme  effort  of  decadent  pagandom  to  publish  and  thus  preserve  for <br/>posterity  its  secret  (or  unwritten)  doctrine.  In  its  teachings  ancient  idealism  found  its  most  perfect <br/>expression.  Neo-Platonism  was  concerned  almost  exclusively  with  the  problems  of  higher <br/><br/><br/>metaphysics.  It  recognized  the  existence  of  a  secret  and  all-important  doctrine  which  from  the  time  of <br/>the  earliest  civilizations  had  been  concealed  within  the  rituals,  symbols,  and  allegories  of  religions <br/>and  philosophies.  To  the  mind  unacquainted  with  its  fundamental  tenets,  Neo-Platonism  may  appear <br/>to  be  a  mass  of  speculations  interspersed  with  extravagant  flights  of  fancy.  Such  a  viewpoint,  however, <br/>ignores  the  institutions  of  the  Mysteries&#x2014;those  secret  schools  into  whose  profundities  of  idealism <br/>nearly  all  of  the  first  philosophers  of  antiquity  were  initiated. <br/><br/>When  the  physical  body  of  pagan  thought  collapsed,  an  attempt  was  made  to  resurrect  the  form  by <br/>instilling  new  life  into  it  by  the  unveiling  of  its  mystical  truths.  This  effort  apparently  was  barren  of <br/>results.  Despite  the  antagonism,  however,  between  pristine  Christianity  and  Neo-Platonism  many <br/>basic  tenets  of  the  latter  were  accepted  by  the  former  and  woven  into  the  fabric  of  Patristic  philosophy. <br/>Briefly  described,  Neo-Platonism  is  a  philosophic  code  which  conceives  every  physical  or  concrete <br/>body  of  doctrine  to  be  merely  the  shell  of  a  spiritual  verity  which  may  be  discovered  through <br/>meditation  and  certain  exercises  of  a  mystic  nature.  In  comparison  to  the  esoteric  spiritual  truths <br/>which  they  contain,  the  corporeal  bodies  of  religion  and  philosophy  were  considered  relatively  of  little <br/>value.  Likewise,  no  emphasis  was  placed  upon  the  material  sciences. <br/><br/>The  term  Patristic  is  employed  to  designate  the  philosophy  of  the  Fathers  of  the  early  Christian <br/>Church.  Patristic  philosophy  is  divided  into  two  general  epochs:  ante-Nicene  and  post-Nicene.  The <br/>ante-Nicene  period  in  the  main  was  devoted  to  attacks  upon  paganism  and  to  apologies  and  defenses <br/>of  Christianity.  The  entire  structure  of  pagan  philosophy  was  assailed  and  the  dictates  of  faith <br/>elevated  above  those  of  reason.  In  some  instances  efforts  were  made  to  reconcile  the  evident  truths  of <br/>paganism  with  Christian  revelation.  Eminent  among  the  ante-Nicene  Fathers  were  St.  Irenseus, <br/>Clement  of  Alexandria,  and  Justin  Martyr.  In  the  post-Nicene  period  more  emphasis  was  placed  upon <br/>the  unfoldment  of  Christian  philosophy  along  Platonic  and  Neo-Platonic  lines,  resulting  in  the <br/>appearance  of  many  strange  documents  of  a  lengthy,  rambling,  and  ambiguous  nature,  nearly  all  of <br/>which  were  philosophically  unsound.  The  post-Nicene  philosophers  included  Athanasius,  Gregory  of <br/>Nyssa,  and  Cyril  of  Alexandria.  The  Patristic  school  is  notable  for  its  emphasis  upon  the  supremacy  of <br/>man  throughout  the  universe.  Man  was  conceived  to  be  a  separate  and  divine  creation&#x2014;the  crowning <br/>achievement  of  Deity  and  an  exception  to  the  suzerainty  of  natural  law.  To  the  Patristics  it  was <br/>inconceivable  that  there  should  ever  exist  another  creature  so  noble,  so  fortunate,  or  so  able  as  man, <br/>for  whose  sole  benefit  and  edification  all  the  kingdoms  of  Nature  were  primarily  created. <br/><br/>Patristic  philosophy  culminated  in  Augustinianism,  which  may  best  be  defined  as  Christian <br/>Platonism.  Opposing  the  Pelasgian  doctrine  that  man  is  the  author  of  his  own  salvation, <br/>Augustinianism  elevated  the  church  and  its  dogmas  to  a  position  of  absolute  infallibility&#x2014; a  position <br/>which  it  successfully  maintained  until  the  Reformation.  Gnosticism,  a  system  of  emanationism, <br/>interpreting  Christianity  in  terms  of  Greek,  Egj^tian,  and  Persian  metaphysics,  appeared  in  the  latter <br/>part  of  the  first  century  of  the  Christian  Era.  Practically  all  the  information  extant  regarding  the <br/>Gnostics  and  their  doctrines,  stigmatized  as  heresy  by  the  ante-Nicene  Church  Fathers,  is  derived <br/>from  the  accusations  made  against  them,  particularly  from  the  writings  of  St.  Irengeus.  In  the  third <br/>century  appeared  Manichseism,  a  dualistic  system  of  Persian  origin,  which  taught  that  Good  and  Evil <br/>were  forever  contending  for  universal  supremacy.  In  Manichseism,  Christ  is  conceived  to  be  the <br/>Principle  of  redeeming  Good  in  contradistinction  to  the  man  Jesus,  who  was  viewed  as  an  evil <br/>personality. <br/><br/>The  death  of  Boethius  in  the  sixth  century  marked  the  close  of  the  ancient  Greek  school  of  philosophy. <br/>The  ninth  century  saw  the  rise  of  the  new  school  of  Scholasticism,  which  sought  to  reconcile <br/>philosophy  with  theology.  Representative  of  the  main  divisions  of  the  Scholastic  school  were  the <br/>Eclecticism  of  John  of  Salisbury,  the  Mysticism  of  Bernard  of  Clairvaux  and  St.  Bonaventura,  the <br/>Rationalism  of  Peter  Abelard,  and  the  pantheistic  Mysticism  of  Meister  Eckhart.  Among  the  Arabian <br/>Aristotelians  were  Avicenna  and  Averroes.  The  zenith  of  Scholasticism  was  reached  with  the  advent  of <br/>Albertus  Magnus  and  his  illustrious  disciple,  St.  Thomas  Aquinas.  Thomism  (the  philosophy  of  St. <br/><br/><br/>Thomas  Aquinas,  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Christian  Aristotle)  sought  to  reconcile  the  various <br/>factions  of  the  Scholastic  school.  Thomism  was  basically  Aristotelian  with  the  added  concept  that <br/>faith  is  a  projection  of  reason. <br/><br/>Scotism,  or  the  doctrine  of  Voluntarism  promulgated  by  Joannes  Duns  Scotus,  a  Franciscan <br/>Scholastic,  emphasized  the  power  and  efficacy  of  the  individual  will,  as  opposed  to  Thomism.  The <br/>outstanding  characteristic  of  Scholasticism  was  its  frantic  effort  to  cast  all  European  thought  in  an <br/>Aristotelian  mold.  Eventually  the  Schoolmen  descended  to  the  level  of  mere  wordmongers  who <br/>picked  the  words  of  Aristotle  so  clean  that  nothing  but  the  bones  remained.  It  was  this  decadent <br/>school  of  meaningless  verbiage  against  which  Sir  Francis  Bacon  directed  his  bitter  shafts  of  irony  and <br/>which  he  relegated  to  the  potter's  field  of  discarded  notions. <br/><br/>The  Baconian,  or  inductive,  system  of  reasoning  (whereby  facts  are  arrived  at  by  a  process  of <br/>observation  and  verified  by  experimentation)  cleared  the  way  for  the  schools  of  modern  science. <br/>Bacon  was  followed  by  Thomas  Hobbes  (for  some  time  his  secretary),  who  held  mathematics  to  be  the <br/>only  exact  science  and  thought  to  be  essentially  a  mathematical  process.  Hobbes  declared  matter  to <br/>be  the  only  reality,  and  scientific  investigation  to  be  limited  to  the  study  of  bodies,  the  phenomena <br/>relative  to  their  probable  causes,  and  the  consequences  which  flow  from  them  under  every  variety  of <br/>circumstance.  Hobbes  laid  special  stress  upon  the  significance  of  words,  declaring  understanding  to <br/>be  the  faculty  of  perceiving  the  relationship  between  words  and  the  objects  for  which  they  stand. <br/><br/>Having  broken  away  from  the  scholastic  and  theological  schools,  Post-Reformation,  or  modern, <br/>philosophy  experienced  a  most  prolific  growth  along  many  diverse  lines.  According  to  Humanism, <br/>man  is  the  measure  of  all  things;  Rationalism  makes  the  reasoning  faculties  the  basis  of  all  knowledge; <br/>Political  Philosophy  holds  that  man  must  comprehend  his  natural,  social,  and  national  privileges; <br/>Empiricism  declares  that  alone  to  be  true  which  is  demonstrable  by  experiment  or  experience; <br/>Moralism  emphasizes  the  necessity  of  right  conduct  as  a  fundamental  philosophic  tenet;  Idealism <br/>asserts  the  realities  of  the  universe  to  be  superphysical&#x2014;either  mental  or  psychical;  Realism,  the <br/>reverse;  and  Phenomenalism  restricts  knowledge  to  facts  or  events  which  can  be  scientifically <br/>described  or  explained.  The  most  recent  developments  in  the  field  of  philosophic  thought  are <br/>Behaviorism  and  Neo-Realism.  The  former  estimates  the  intrinsic  characteristics  through  an  analysis <br/>of  behavior;  the  latter  maybe  summed  up  as  the  total  extinction  of  idealism. <br/><br/>Baruch  de  Spinoza,  the  eminent  Dutch  philosopher,  conceived  God  to  be  a  substance  absolutely  self- <br/>existent  and  needing  no  other  conception  besides  itself  to  render  it  complete  and  intelligible.  The <br/>nature  of  this  Being  was  held  by  Spinoza  to  be  comprehensible  only  through  its  attributes,  which  are <br/>extension  and  thought:  these  combine <br/><br/><br/>THE  PTOLEMAIC  SCHEME  OF  THE  UNIVERSE. <br/><br/><br/>From  an  old  print,  courtesy  of  Carl  Oscar  Borg. <br/><br/>In  ridiculing  the  geocentric  system  of  astronomy  expounded  by  Claudius  Ptolemy,  modem  astronomers  have  overlooked <br/>the  philosophic  key  to  the  Ptolemaic  system.  The  universe  of  Ptolemy  is  a  diagrammatic  representation  of  the <br/>relationships  existing  between  the  various  divine  and  elemental  parts  of  every  creature,  and  is  not  concerned  with <br/>astronomy  as  that  science  is  now  comprehended.  In  the  above  figure,  special  attention  is  called  to  the  three  circles  of <br/>zodiacs  surrounding  the  orbits  of  the  planets.  These  zodiacs  represent  the  threefold  spiritual  constitution  of  the  universe. <br/>The  orbits  of  the  planets  are  the  Governors  of  the  World  and  the  four  elemental  spheres  in  the  center  represent  the <br/>physical  constitution  of  both  man  and  the  universe,  Ptolemy's  scheme  of  the  universe  is  simply  a  cross  section  of  the <br/>universal  aura,  the  planets  and  elements  to  which  he  refers  having  no  relation  to  those  recognized  by  modern  astronomers. <br/><br/>p.  18 <br/><br/>to  form  an  endless  variety  of  aspects  or  modes.  The  mind  of  man  is  one  of  the  modes  of  infinite <br/>thought;  the  body  of  man  one  of  the  modes  of  infinite  extension.  Through  reason  man  is  enabled  to <br/>elevate  himself  above  the  illusionary  world  of  the  senses  and  find  eternal  repose  in  perfect  union  with <br/>the  Divine  Essence.  Spinoza,  it  has  been  said,  deprived  God  of  all  personality,  making  Deity <br/>synonymous  with  the  universe. <br/><br/>German  philosophy  had  its  inception  with  Gottfried  Wilhelm  von  Leibnitz,  whose  theories  are <br/>permeated  with  the  qualities  of  optimism  and  idealism.  Leibnitz's  criteria  of  sufficient  reason <br/>revealed  to  him  the  insufficiency  of  Descartes'  theory  of  extension,  and  he  therefore  concluded  that <br/>substance  itself  contained  an  inherent  power  in  the  form  of  an  incalculable  number  of  separate  and <br/>all-sufficient  units.  Matter  reduced  to  its  ultimate  particles  ceases  to  exist  as  a  substantial  body,  being <br/>resolved  into  a  mass  of  immaterial  ideas  or  metaphysical  units  of  power,  to  which  Leibnitz  applied  the <br/><br/><br/>term  monad.  Thus  the  universe  is  composed  of  an  infinite  number  of  separate  monadic  entities <br/>unfolding  spontaneously  through  the  objectification  of  innate  active  qualities.  All  things  are  conceived <br/>as  consisting  of  single  monads  of  varying  magnitudes  or  of  aggregations  of  these  bodies,  which  may <br/>exist  as  physical,  emotional,  mental,  or  spiritual  substances.  God  is  the  first  and  greatest  Monad;  the <br/>spirit  of  man  is  an  awakened  monad  in  contradistinction  to  the  lower  kingdoms  whose  governing <br/>monadic  powers  are  in  a  semi-dormant  state. <br/><br/>Though  a  product  of  the  Leibnitzian-Wolfian  school,  Immanuel  Kant,  like  Locke,  dedicated  himself  to <br/>investigation  of  the  powers  and  limits  of  human  understanding.  The  result  was  his  critical  philosophy, <br/>embracing  the  critique  of  pure  reason,  the  critique  of  practical  reason,  and  the  critique  of  judgment. <br/>Dr.  W.  J.  Durant  sums  up  Kant's  philosophy  in  the  concise  statement  that  he  rescued  mind  from <br/>matter.  The  mind  Kant  conceived  to  be  the  selector  and  coordinator  of  all  perceptions,  which  in  turn <br/>are  the  result  of  sensations  grouping  themselves  about  some  external  object.  In  the  classification  of <br/>sensations  and  ideas  the  mind  employs  certain  categories:  of  sense,  time  and  space;  of  understanding, <br/>quality,  relation,  modality,  and  causation;  and  the  unity  of  apperception.  Being  subject  to <br/>mathematical  laws,  time  and  space  are  considered  absolute  and  sufficient  bases  for  exact  thinking. <br/>Kant's  practical  reason  declared  that  while  the  nature  of  noumenon  could  never  be  comprehended  by <br/>the  reason,  the  fact  of  morality  proves  the  existence  of  three  necessary  postulates:  free  will, <br/>immortality,  and  God.  In  the  critique  of  judgment  Kant  demonstrates  the  union  of  the  noumenon  and <br/>the  phenomenon  in  art  and  biological  evolution.  German  superintellectualism  is  the  outgrowth  of  an <br/>overemphasis  of  Kant's  theory  of  the  autocratic  supremaq?^  of  the  mind  over  sensation  and  thought. <br/>The  philosophy  of  Johann  Gottlieb  Fichte  was  a  projection  of  Kant's  philosophy,  wherein  he <br/>attempted  to  unite  Kant's  practical  reason  with  his  pure  reason.  Fichte  held  that  the  known  is  merely <br/>the  contents  of  the  consciousness  of  the  knower,  and  that  nothing  can  exist  to  the  knower  until  it <br/>becomes  part  of  those  contents.  Nothing  is  actually  real,  therefore,  except  the  facts  of  one's  own <br/>mental  experience. <br/><br/>Recognizing  the  necessity  of  certain  objective  realities,  Friedrich  Wilhelm  Joseph  von  Schelling,  who <br/>succeeded  Fichte  in  the  chair  of  philosophy  at  Jena,  first  employed  the  doctrine  of  identity  as  the <br/>groundwork  for  a  complete  system  of  philosophy.  Whereas  Fichte  regarded  self  as  the  Absolute,  von <br/>Schelling  conceived  infinite  and  eternal  Mind  to  be  the  all-pervading  Cause.  Realization  of  the <br/>Absolute  is  made  possible  by  intellectual  intuition  which,  being  a  superior  or  spiritual  sense,  is  able  to <br/>dissociate  itself  from  both  subject  and  object.  Kant's  categories  of  space  and  time  von  Schelling <br/>conceived  to  be  positive  and  negative  respectively,  and  material  existence  the  result  of  the  reciprocal <br/>action  of  these  two  expressions.  Von  Schelling  also  held  that  the  Absolute  in  its  process  of  self- <br/>development  proceeds  according  to  a  law  or  rhythm  consisting  of  three  movements.  The  first,  a <br/>reflective  movement,  is  the  attempt  of  the  Infinite  to  embody  itself  in  the  finite.  The  second,  that  of <br/>subsumption,  is  the  attempt  of  the  Absolute  to  return  to  the  Infinite  after  involvement  in  the  finite. <br/>The  third,  that  of  reason,  is  the  neutral  point  wherein  the  two  former  movements  are  blended. <br/><br/>Georg  Wilhelm  Friedrich  Hegel  considered  the  intellectual  intuition  of  von  Schelling  to  be <br/>philosophically  unsound  and  hence  turned  his  attention  to  the  establishment  of  a  system  of <br/>philosophy  based  upon  pure  logic.  Of  Hegel  it  has  been  said  that  he  began  with  nothing  and  showed <br/>with  logical  precision  how  everything  had  proceeded  from  it  in  logical  order.  Hegel  elevated  logic  to  a <br/>position  of  supreme  importance,  in  fact  as  a  quality  of  the  Absolute  itself.  God  he  conceived  to  be  a <br/>process  of  unfolding  which  never  attains  to  the  condition  of  unfoldment.  In  like  manner,  thought  is <br/>without  either  beginning  or  end.  Hegel  further  believed  that  all  things  owe  their  existence  to  their <br/>opposites  and  that  all  opposites  are  actually  identical.  Thus  the  only  existence  is  the  relationship  of <br/>opposites  to  each  other,  through  whose  combinations  new  elements  are  produced.  As  the  Divine <br/>Mind  is  an  eternal  process  of  thought  never  accomplished,  Hegel  assails  the  very  foundation  of <br/>theism  and  his  philosophy  limits  immortality  to  the  everflowing  Deity  alone.  Evolution  is <br/>consequently  the  never-ending  flow  of  Divine  Consciousness  out  of  itself;  all  creation,  though <br/>continually  moving,  never  arrives  at  any  state  other  than  that  of  ceaseless  flow. <br/><br/><br/>Johann  Friedrich  Herbart's  philosophy  was  a  reahstic  reaction  from  the  idealism  of  Fichte  and  von <br/>Schelling.  To  Herbart  the  true  basis  of  philosophy  was  the  great  mass  of  phenomena  continually <br/>moving  through  the  human  mind.  Examination  of  phenomena,  however,  demonstrates  that  a  great <br/>part  of  it  is  unreal,  at  least  incapable  of  supplying  the  mind  with  actual  truth.  To  correct  the  false <br/>impressions  caused  by  phenomena  and  discover  reality,  Herbart  believed  it  necessary  to  resolve <br/>phenomena  into  separate  elements,  for  reality  exists  in  the  elements  and  not  in  the  whole.  He  stated <br/>that  objects  can  be  classified  by  three  general  terms:  thing,  matter,  and  mind;  the  first  a  unit  of <br/>several  properties,  the  second  an  existing  object,  the  third  a  self-conscious  being.  All  three  notions <br/>give  rise,  however,  to  certain  contradictions,  with  whose  solution  Herbart  is  primarily  concerned.  For <br/>example,  consider  matter.  Though  capable  of  filling  space,  if  reduced  to  its  ultimate  state  it  consists  of <br/>incomprehensibly  minute  units  of  divine  energy  occupying  no  physical  space  whatsoever. <br/><br/>The  true  subject  of  Arthur  Schopenhauer's  philosophy  is  the  will;  the  object  of  his  philosophy  is  the <br/>elevation  of  the  mind  to  the  point  where  it  is  capable  of  controlling  the  will.  Schopenhauer  likens  the <br/>will  to  a  strong  blind  man  who  carries  on  his  shoulders  the  intellect,  which  is  a  weak  lame  man <br/>possessing  the  power  of  sight.  The  will  is  the  tireless  cause  of  manifestation  and  every  part  of  Nature <br/>the  product  of  will.  The  brain  is  the  product  of  the  will  to  know;  the  hand  the  product  of  the  will  to <br/>grasp.  The  entire  intellectual  and  emotional  constitutions  of  man  are  subservient  to  the  will  and  are <br/>largely  concerned  with  the  effort  to  justify  the  dictates  of  the  will.  Thus  the  mind  creates  elaborate <br/>systems  of  thought  simply  to  prove  the  necessity  of  the  thing  willed.  Genius,  however,  represents  the <br/>state  wherein  the  intellect  has  gained  supremacy  over  the  will  and  the  life  is  ruled  by  reason  and  not <br/>by  impulse.  The  strength  of  Christianity,  said  Schopenhauer,  lay  in  its  pessimism  and  conquest  of <br/>individual  will.  His  own  religious  viewpoints  resembled  closely  the  Buddhistic.  To  him  Nirvana <br/>represented  the  subjugation  of  will.  Life&#x2014;the  manifestation  of  the  blind  will  to  live&#x2014;he  viewed  as  a <br/>misfortune,  claiming  that  the  true  philosopher  was  one  who,  recognizing  the  wisdom  of  death, <br/>resisted  the  inherent  urge  to  reproduce  his  kind. <br/><br/><br/>THE  TREE  OF  CLASSICAL  MYTHOLOGY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Hort's  The  New  Pantheon. <br/><br/>Before  a  proper  appreciation  of  the  deeper  scientific  aspects  of  Greek  mythology  is  possible,  it  is  necessary  to  organize  the <br/>Greek  pantheon  and  arrange  its  gods,  goddesses,  and  various  superhuman  hierarchies  in  concatenated  order.  Proclus,  the <br/>great  Neo-Platonist,  in  his  commentaries  on  the  theology  of  Plato,  gives  an  invaluable  key  to  the  sequence  of  the  various <br/>deities  in  relation  to  the  First  Cause  and  the  inferior  powers  emanating  from  themselves.  When  thus  arranged,  the  divine <br/>hierarchies  may  be  likened  to  the  branches  of  a  great  tree.  The  roots  of  this  tree  are  firmly  imbedded  in  Unknowable  Being. <br/>The  trunk  and  larger  branches  of  the  tree  symbolize  the  superior  gods;  the  twigs  and  leaves,  the  innumerable  existences <br/>dependent  upon  the  first  and  unchanging  Power. <br/><br/>p.  19 <br/><br/>Of  Friedrich  Wilhelm  Nietzsche  it  has  been  said  that  his  peculiar  contribution  to  the  cause  of  human <br/>hope  was  the  glad  tidings  that  God  had  died  of  pity!  The  outstanding  features  of  Nietzsche's <br/>philosophy  are  his  doctrine  of  eternal  recurrence  and  the  extreme  emphasis  placed  by  him  upon  the <br/>will  to  power&#x2014; SL  projection  of  Schopenhauer's  will  to  live.  Nietzsche  believed  the  purpose  of  existence <br/>to  be  the  production  of  a  type  of  all-powerful  individual,  designated  by  him  the  superman.  This <br/>superman  was  the  product  of  careful  culturing,  for  if  not  separated  forcibly  from  the  mass  and <br/>consecrated  to  the  production  of  power,  the  individual  would  sink  back  to  the  level  of  the  deadly <br/>mediocre.  Love,  Nietzsche  said,  should  be  sacrificed  to  the  production  of  the  superman  and  those  only <br/><br/><br/>should  marry  who  are  best  fitted  to  produce  this  outstanding  type.  Nietzsche  also  believed  in  the  rule <br/><br/>of  the  aristocracy,  both  blood  and  breeding  being  essential  to  the  establishment  of  this  superior  type. <br/>Nietzsche's  doctrine  did  not  liberate  the  masses;  it  rather  placed  over  them  supermen  for  whom  their <br/>inferior  brothers  and  sisters  should  be  perfectly  reconciled  to  die.  Ethically  and  politically,  the <br/>superman  was  a  law  unto  himself.  To  those  who  understand  the  true  meaning  of  power  to  be  virtue, <br/>self-control,  and  truth,  the  ideality  behind  Nietzsche's  theory  is  apparent.  To  the  superficial,  however, <br/>it  is  a  philosophy  heartless  and  calculating,  concerned  solely  with  the  survival  of  the  fittest. <br/><br/>Of  the  other  German  schools  of  philosophic  thought,  limitations  of  space  preclude  detailed  mention. <br/>The  more  recent  developments  of  the  German  school  are  Freudianism  and  Relativism  (often  called <br/>the  Einstein  theory).  The  former  is  a  system  of  psychoanalysis  through  psychopathic  and  neurological <br/>phenomena;  the  latter  attacks  the  accuracy  of  mechanical  principles  dependent  upon  the  present <br/>theory  of  velocity. <br/><br/>Rene  Descartes  stands  at  the  head  of  the  French  school  of  philosophy  and  shares  with  Sir  Francis <br/>Bacon  the  honor  of  founding  the  systems  of  modern  science  and  philosophy.  As  Bacon  based  his <br/>conclusions  upon  observation  of  external  things,  so  Descartes  founded  his  metaphysical  philosophy <br/>upon  observation  of  internal  things.  Cartesianism  (the  philosophy  of  Descartes)  first  eliminates  all <br/>things  and  then  replaces  as  fundamental  those  premises  without  which  existence  is  impossible. <br/>Descartes  defined  an  idea  as  that  which  fills  the  mind  when  we  conceive  a  thing.  The  truth  of  an  idea <br/>must  be  determined  by  the  criteria  of  clarity  and  distinctness.  Hence  Descartes,  held  that  a  clear  and <br/>distinct  idea  must  be  true.  Descartes  has  the  distinction  also  of  evolving  his  own  philosophy  without <br/>recourse  to  authority.  Consequently  his  conclusions  are  built  up  from  the  simplest  of  premises  and <br/>grow  in  complexity  as  the  structure  of  his  philosophy  takes  form. <br/><br/>The  Positive  philosophy  of  Auguste  Comte  is  based  upon  the  theory  that  the  human  intellect  develops <br/><br/>through  three  stages  of  thought.  The  first  and  lowest  stage  is  theological;  the  second,  metaphysical; <br/>and  the  third  and  highest,  positive.  Thus  theology  and  metaphysics  are  the  feeble  intellectual  efforts <br/>of  humanity's  child-mind  and  positivism  is  the  mental  expression  of  the  adult  intellect.  In  his  Cours <br/>de  Philosophie  positive,  Comte  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;In  the  final,  the  positive  state,  the  mind  has  given  over  the  vain  search  after  Absolute  notions,  the <br/>origin  and  destination  of  the  universe,  and  the  causes  of  phenomena,  and  applies  itself  to  the  study  of <br/>their  laws,~that  is,  their  invariable  relations  of  succession  and  resemblance.  Reasoning  and <br/>observation,  duly  combined,  are  the  means  of  this  knowledge.&quot;  Comte's  theory  is  described  as  an <br/>&quot;enormous  system  of  materialism.&quot;  According  to  Comte,  it  was  formerly  said  that  the  heavens  declare <br/>the  glory  of  God,  but  now  they  only  recount  the  glory  of  Newton  and  Laplace. <br/><br/>Among  the  French  schools  of  philosophy  are  Traditionalism  (often  applied  to  Christianity),  which <br/>esteems  tradition  as  the  proper  foundation  for  philosophy;  the  Sociological  school,  which  regards <br/>humanity  as  one  vast  social  organism;  the  Encyclopedists,  whose  efforts  to  classify  knowledge <br/>according  to  the  Baconian  system  revolutionized  European  thought;  Voltairism,  which  assailed  the <br/>divine  origin  of  the  Christian  faith  and  adopted  an  attitude  of  extreme  skepticism  toward  all  matters <br/>pertaining  to  theology;  and  Neo-Criticism,  a  French  revision  of  the  doctrines  of  Immanuel  Kant. <br/><br/>Henri  Bergson,  the  intuitionalist,  undoubtedly  the  greatest  living  French  philosopher,  presents  a <br/>theory  of  mystic  anti-intellectualism  founded  upon  the  premise  of  creative  evolution.  His  rapid  rise  to <br/>popularity  is  due  to  his  appeal  to  the  finer  sentiments  in  human  nature,  which  rebel  against  the <br/>hopelessness  and  helplessness  of  materialistic  science  and  realistic  philosophy.  Bergson  sees  God  as <br/>life  continually  struggling  against  the  limitations  of  matter.  He  even  conceives  the  possible  victory  of <br/>life  over  matter,  and  in  time  the  annihilation  of  death. <br/><br/><br/>Applying  the  Baconian  method  to  the  mind,  John  Locke,  the  great  EngHsh  philosopher,  declared  that <br/><br/>everything  which  passes  through  the  mind  is  a  legitimate  object  of  mental  philosophy,  and  that  these <br/>mental  phenomena  are  as  real  and  valid  as  the  objects  of  any  other  science.  In  his  investigations  of <br/>the  origin  of  phenomena  Locke  departed  from  the  Baconian  requirement  that  it  was  first  necessary  to <br/>make  a  natural  history  of  facts.  The  mind  was  regarded  by  Locke  to  be  blank  until  experience  is <br/>inscribed  upon  it.  Thus  the  mind  is  built  up  of  received  impressions  plus  reflection.  The  soul  Locke <br/>believed  to  be  incapable  of  apprehension  of  Deity,  and  man's  realization  or  cognition  of  God  to  be <br/>merely  an  inference  of  the  reasoning  faculty.  David  Hume  was  the  most  enthusiastic  and  also  the <br/>most  powerful  of  the  disciples  of  Locke. <br/><br/>Attacking  Locke's  sensationalism,  Bishop  George  Berkeley  substituted  for  it  a  philosophy  founded  on <br/>Locke's  fundamental  premises  but  which  he  developed  as  a  system  of  idealism.  Berkeley  held  that <br/>ideas  are  the  real  objects  of  knowledge.  He  declared  it  impossible  to  adduce  proof  that  sensations  are <br/>occasioned  by  material  objects;  he  also  attempted  to  prove  that  matter  has  no  existence. <br/>Berkeleianism  holds  that  the  universe  is  permeated  and  governed  by  mind.  Thus  the  belief  in  the <br/>existence  of  material  objects  is  merely  a  mental  condition,  and  the  objects  themselves  may  well  be <br/>fabrications  of  the  mind.  At  the  same  time  Berkeley  considered  it  worse  than  insanity  to  question  the <br/>accuraq?^  of  the  perceptions;  for  if  the  power  of  the  perceptive  faculties  be  questioned  man  is  reduced <br/>to  a  creature  incapable  of  knowing,  estimating,  or  realizing  anything  whatsoever. <br/><br/>In  the  Associationalism  of  Hartley  and  Hume  was  advanced  the  theory  that  the  association  of  ideas  is <br/>the  fundamental  principle  of  psychology  and  the  explanation  for  all  mental  phenomena.  Hartley  held <br/>that  if  a  sensation  be  repeated  several  times  there  is  a  tendency  towards  its  spontaneous  repetition, <br/>which  may  be  awakened  by  association  with  some  other  idea  even  though  the  object  causing  the <br/>original  reaction  be  absent.  The  Utilitarianism  of  Jeremy  Bentham,  Archdeacon  Paley,  and  James <br/>and  John  Stuart  Mill  declares  that  to  be  the  greatest  good  which  is  the  most  useful  to  the  greatest <br/>number.  John  Stuart  Mill  believed  that  if  it  is  possible  through  sensation  to  secure  knowledge  of  the <br/>properties  of  things,  it  is  also  possible  through  a  higher  state  of  the  mind&#x2014;that  is,  intuition  or  reason- <br/>-to  gain  a  knowledge  of  the  true  substance  of  things. <br/><br/>Darwinism  is  the  doctrine  of  natural  selection  and  physical  evolution.  It  has  been  said  of  Charles <br/>Robert  Darwin  that  he  determined  to  banish  spirit  altogether  from  the  universe  and  make  the  infinite <br/>and  omnipresent  Mind  itself  synonymous  with  the  all-pervading  powers  of  an  impersonal  Nature. <br/>Agnosticism  and  Neo-Hegelianism  are  also  noteworthy  products  of  this  period  of  philosophic <br/>thought.  The  former  is  the  belief  that  the  nature  of  ultimates  is  unknowable;  the  latter  an  English  and <br/>American  revival  of  Hegel's  idealism. <br/><br/>Dr.  W.  J.  Durant  declares  that  Herbert  Spencer's  Great  Work,  First  Principles,  made  him  almost  at <br/>once  the  most  famous  philosopher  of  his  time.  Spencerianism  is  a  philosophic  positivism  which <br/>describes  evolution  as  an  ever-increasing  complexity  with  equilibrium  as  its  highest  possible  state. <br/>According  to  Spencer,  life  is  a  continuous  process  from  homogeneity  to  heterogeneity  and  back  from <br/>heterogeneity  to  homogeneity.  Life  also  involves  the  continual  adjustment  of  internal  relations  to <br/>external  relations.  Most  famous  of  all  Spencer's  aphorisms  is  his  definition  of  Deity:  &quot;God  is  infinite <br/>intelligence,  infinitely  diversified  through  infinite  time  and  infinite  space,  manifesting  through  an <br/>infinitude  of  ever-evolving  individualities.&quot;  The  universality  of  the  law  of  evolution  was  emphasized <br/>by  Spencer,  who  applied  it  not  only  to  the  form  but  also  to  the  intelligence  behind  the  form.  In  every <br/>manifestation  of  being  he  recognized  the  fundamental  tendency  of  unfoldment  from  simplicity  to <br/>complexity,  observing  that  when  the  point  of  equilibrium  is  reached  it  is <br/><br/><br/>A  CHRISTIAN  TRINITY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Hone's  Ancient  Mystenes  Described. <br/><br/>In  an  effort  to  set  forth  in  an  appropriate  figure  the  Christian  doctrine  of  the  Trinity,  it  was  necessary  to  devise  an  image  in <br/>which  the  three  persons&#x2014;Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost&#x2014; were  separate  and  yet  one.  In  different  parts  of  Europe  may  be <br/>seen  figures  similar  to  the  above,  wherein  three  faces  are  united  in  one  head.  This  is  a  legitimate  method  of  for  to  those <br/>able  to  realize  the  sacred  significance  of  the  threefold  head  a  great  mystery  is  revealed.  However,  in  the  presence  of  such <br/>applications  of  symbology  in  Christian  art,  it  is  scarcely  proper  to  consider  the  philosophers  of  other  faiths  as  benighted  if, <br/>like  the  Hindus,  they  have  a  three-faced  Brahma,  or,  like  the  Romans,  a  two-faced  Janus. <br/><br/>p.  20 <br/><br/>always  followed  by  the  process  of  dissolution.  According  to  Spencer,  however,  disintegration  took <br/>place  only  that  reintegration  might  follow  upon  a  higher  level  of  being. <br/><br/>The  chief  position  in  the  Italian  school  of  philosophy  should  be  awarded  to  Giordano  Bruno,  who, <br/>after  enthusiastically  accepting  Copernicus'  theory  that  the  sun  is  the  center  of  the  solar  system, <br/>declared  the  sun  to  be  a  star  and  all  the  stars  to  be  suns.  In  Bruno's  time  the  earth  was  regarded  as  the <br/>center  of  all  creation.  Consequently  when  he  thus  relegated  the  world  and  man  to  an  obscure  corner <br/>in  space  the  effect  was  cataclysmic.  For  the  heresy  of  affirming  a  multiplicity  of  universes  and <br/>conceiving  Cosmos  to  be  so  vast  that  no  single  creed  could  fill  it,  Bruno  paid  the  forfeit  of  his  life. <br/><br/>Vicoism  is  a  philosophy  based  upon  the  conclusions  of  Giovanni  Battista  Vico,  who  held  that  God <br/>controls  His  world  not  miraculously  but  through  natural  law.  The  laws  by  which  men  rule  themselves, <br/>Vico  declared,  issue  from  a  spiritual  source  within  mankind  which  is  en  rapport  with  the  law  of  the <br/>Deity.  Hence  material  law  is  of  divine  origin  and  reflects  the  dictates  of  the  Spiritual  Father.  The <br/>philosophy  of  Ontologism  developed  by  Vincenzo  Gioberti  (generally  considered  more  as  a  theologian <br/>than  a  philosopher)  posits  God  as  the  only  being  and  the  origin  of  all  knowledge,  knowledge  being <br/>identical  with  Deity  itself.  God  is  consequently  called  Being;  all  other  manifestations  are  existences. <br/>Truth  is  to  be  discovered  through  reflection  upon  this  mystery. <br/><br/><br/>The  most  important  of  modern  Italian  philosophers  is  Benedetto  Croce,  a  Hegelian  idealist.  Croce <br/>conceives  ideas  to  be  the  only  reality.  He  is  anti-theological  in  his  viewpoints,  does  not  believe  in  the <br/>immortality  of  the  soul,  and  seeks  to  substitute  ethics  and  aesthetics  for  religion.  Among  other <br/>branches  of  Italian  philosophy  should  be  mentioned  Sensism  (Sensationalism),  which  posits  the <br/>sense  perceptions  as  the  sole  channels  for  the  reception  of  knowledge;  Criticism,  or  the  philosophy  of <br/>accurate  judgment;  and  Neo-Scholasticism,  which  is  a  revival  of  Thomism  encouraged  by  the  Roman <br/>Catholic  Church. <br/><br/>The  two  outstanding  schools  of  American  philosophy  are  Transcendentalism  and  Pragmatism. <br/>Transcendentalism,  exemplified  in  the  writings  of  Ralph  Waldo  Emerson,  emphasizes  the  power  of <br/>the  transcendental  over  the  physical.  Many  of  Emerson's  writings  show  pronounced  Oriental <br/>influence,  particularly  his  essays  on  the  Oversoul  and  the  Law  of  Compensation.  The  theory  of <br/>Pragmatism,  while  not  original  with  Professor  William  James,  owes  its  widespread  popularity  as  a <br/>philosophic  tenet  to  his  efforts.  Pragmatism  may  be  defined  as  the  doctrine  that  the  meaning  and <br/>nature  of  things  are  to  be  discovered  from  consideration  of  their  consequences.  The  true,  according  to <br/>James,  &quot;is  only  an  expedient  in  the  way  of  our  thinking,  just  as  'the  right'  is  only  an  expedient  in  the <br/>way  of  our  behaving.&quot;  (See  his  Pragmatism.)  John  Dewey,  the  Instrumentalist,  who  applies  the <br/>experimental  attitude  to  all  the  aims  of  life,  should  be  considered  a  commentator  of  James.  To  Dewey, <br/>growth  and  change  are  limitless  and  no  ultimates  are  postulated.  The  long  residence  in  America  of <br/>George  Santayana  warrants  the  listing  of  this  great  Spaniard  among  the  ranks  of  American <br/>philosophers.  Defending  himself  with  the  shield  of  skepticism  alike  from  the  illusions  of  the  senses <br/>and  the  cumulative  errors  of  the  ages,  Santayana  seeks  to  lead  mankind  into  a  more  apprehending <br/>state  denominated  by  him  the  life  of  reason. <br/><br/>(In  addition  to  the  authorities  already  quoted,  in  the  preparation  of  the  foregoing  abstract  of  the  main <br/>branches  of  philosophic  thought  the  present  writer  has  had  recourse  to  Stanley's  History  of <br/>Philosophy;  Morell's  An  Historical  and  Critical  View  of  the  Speculative  Philosophy  of  Europe  in  the <br/>Nineteenth  Century;  Singer's  Modern  Thinkers  and  Present  Problems;  Rand's  Modern  Classical <br/>Philosophers;  Windelband's  History  of  Philosophy;  Perry's  Present  Philosophical  Tendencies; <br/>Hamilton's  Lectures  on  Metaphysics  and  Logic;  and  Durant's  The  Story  of  Philosophy.) <br/><br/>Having  thus  traced  the  more  or  less  sequential  development  of  philosophic  speculation  from  Thales <br/>to  James  and  Bergson,  it  is  now  in  order  to  direct  the  reader's  attention  to  the  elements  leading  to  and <br/>the  circumstances  attendant  upon  the  genesis  of  philosophic  thinking.  Although  the  Hellenes  proved <br/>themselves  peculiarly  responsive  to  the  disciplines  of  philosophy,  this  science  of  sciences  should  not <br/>be  considered  indigenous  to  them.  &quot;Although  some  of  the  Grecians,&quot;  writes  Thomas  Stanley,  &quot;have <br/>challenged  to  their  nation  the  original  of  philosophy,  yet  the  more  learned  of  them  have <br/>acknowledged  it  [to  be]  derived  from  the  East.&quot;  The  magnificent  institutions  of  Hindu,  Chaldean,  and <br/>Egyptian  learning  must  be  recognized  as  the  actual  source  of  Greek  wisdom.  The  last  was  patterned <br/>after  the  shadow  cast  by  the  sanctuaries  of  EUora,  Ur,  and  Memphis  upon  the  thought  substance  of  a <br/>primitive  people.  Thales,  Pythagoras,  and  Plato  in  their  philosophic  wanderings  contacted  many <br/>distant  cults  and  brought  back  the  lore  of  Egypt  and  the  inscrutable  Orient. <br/><br/>From  indisputable  facts  such  as  these  it  is  evident  that  philosophy  emerged  from  the  religious <br/>Mysteries  of  antiquity,  not  being  separated  from  religion  until  after  the  decay  of  the  Mysteries.  Hence <br/>he  who  would  fathom  the  depths  of  philosophic  thought  must  familiarize  himself  with  the  teachings <br/>of  those  initiated  priests  designated  as  the  first  custodians  of  divine  revelation.  The  Mysteries  claimed <br/>to  be  the  guardians  of  a  transcendental  knowledge  so  profound  as  to  be  incomprehensible  save  to  the <br/>most  exalted  intellect  and  so  potent  as  to  be  revealed  with  safety  only  to  those  in  whom  personal <br/>ambition  was  dead  and  who  had  consecrated  their  lives  to  the  unselfish  service  of  humanity.  Both  the <br/>dignity  of  these  sacred  institutions  and  the  validity  of  their  claim  to  possession  of  Universal  Wisdom <br/>are  attested  by  the  most  illustrious  philosophers  of  antiquity,  who  were  themselves  initiated  into  the <br/>profundities  of  the  secret  doctrine  and  who  bore  witness  to  its  efficacy. <br/><br/><br/>The  question  may  legitimately  be  propounded:  If  these  ancient  mystical  institutions  were  of  such <br/>&quot;great  pith  and  moment,&quot;  why  is  so  little  information  now  available  concerning  them  and  the  arcana <br/>they  claimed  to  possess?  The  answer  is  simple  enough:  The  Mysteries  were  secret  societies,  binding <br/>their  initiates  to  inviolable  secrecy,  and  avenging  with  death  the  betrayal  of  their  sacred  trusts. <br/>Although  these  schools  were  the  true  inspiration  of  the  various  doctrines  promulgated  by  the  ancient <br/>philosophers,  the  fountainhead  of  those  doctrines  was  never  revealed  to  the  profane.  Furthermore,  in <br/>the  lapse  of  time  the  teachings  became  so  inextricably  linked  with  the  names  of  their  disseminators <br/>that  the  actual  but  recondite  source&#x2014;the  Mysteries&#x2014;came  to  be  wholly  ignored. <br/><br/>Symbolism  is  the  language  of  the  Mysteries;  in  fact  it  is  the  language  not  only  of  mysticism  and <br/>philosophy  but  of  all  Nature,  for  every  law  and  power  active  in  universal  procedure  is  manifested  to <br/>the  limited  sense  perceptions  of  man  through  the  medium  of  symbol.  Every  form  existing  in  the <br/>diversified  sphere  of  being  is  symbolic  of  the  divine  activity  by  which  it  is  produced.  By  symbols  men <br/>have  ever  sought  to  communicate  to  each  other  those  thoughts  which  transcend  the  limitations  of <br/>language.  Rejecting  man-conceived  dialects  as  inadequate  and  unworthy  to  perpetuate  divine  ideas, <br/>the  Mysteries  thus  chose  symbolism  as  a  far  more  ingenious  and  ideal  method  of  preserving  their <br/>transcendental  knowledge.  In  a  single  figure  a  symbol  may  both  reveal  and  conceal,  for  to  the  wise  the <br/>subject  of  the  symbol  is  obvious,  while  to  the  ignorant  the  figure  remains  inscrutable.  Hence,  he  who <br/>seeks  to  unveil  the  secret  doctrine  of  antiquity  must  search  for  that  doctrine  not  upon  the  open  pages <br/>of  books  which  might  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  unworthy  but  in  the  place  where  it  was  originally <br/>concealed. <br/><br/>Far-sighted  were  the  initiates  of  antiquity.  They  realized  that  nations  come  and  go,  that  empires  rise <br/>and  fall,  and  that  the  golden  ages  of  art,  science,  and  idealism  are  succeeded  by  the  dark  ages  of <br/>superstition.  With  the  needs  of  posterity  foremost  in  mind,  the  sages  of  old  went  to  inconceivable <br/>extremes  to  make  certain  that  their  knowledge  should  be  preserved.  They  engraved  it  upon  the  face  of <br/>mountains  and  concealed  it  within  the  measurements  of  colossal  images,  each  of  which  was  a <br/>geometric  marvel.  Their  knowledge  of  chemistry  and  mathematics  they  hid  within  mythologies  which <br/>the  ignorant  would  perpetuate,  or  in  the  spans  and  arches  of  their  temples  which  time  has  not  entirely <br/>obliterated.  They  wrote  in  characters  that  neither  the  vandalism  of  men  nor  the  ruthlessness  of  the <br/>elements  could  completely  efface.  Today  men  gaze  with  awe  and  reverence  upon  the  mighty <br/>Memnons  standing  alone  on  the  sands  of  Egypt,  or  upon  the  strange  terraced  pyramids  of  Palanque. <br/>Mute  testimonies  these  are  of  the  lost  arts  and  sciences  of  antiquity;  and  concealed  this  wisdom  must <br/>remain  until  this  race  has  learned  to  read  the  universal  language&#x2014; SYMBOLISM. <br/><br/>The  book  to  which  this  is  the  introduction  is  dedicated  to  the  proposition  that  concealed  within  the <br/>emblematic  figures,  allegories,  and  rituals  of  the  ancients  is  a  secret  doctrine  concerning  the  inner <br/>mysteries  of  life,  which  doctrine  has  been  preserved  in  toto  among  a  small  band  of  initiated  minds <br/>since  the  beginning  of  the  world.  Departing,  these  illumined  philosophers  left  their  formula  that <br/>others,  too,  might  attain  to  understanding.  But,  lest  these  secret  processes  fall  into  uncultured  hands <br/>and  be  perverted,  the  Great  Arcanum  was  always  concealed  in  symbol  or  allegory;  and  those  who  can <br/>today  discover  its  lost  keys  may  open  with  them  a  treasure  house  of  philosophic,  scientific,  and <br/>religious  truths. <br/><br/><br/>THE  ORPHIC  EGG. <br/><br/><br/>From  Bryant's  An  Analysis  of  Ancient  Mythology. <br/><br/>The  ancient  symbol  of  the  Orphic  Mysteries  was  the  serpent-entwined  egg,  which  signified  Cosmos  as  encircled  by  the <br/>fiery  Creative  Spirit.  The  egg  also  represents  the  soul  of  the  philosopher;  the  serpent,  the  Mysteries.  At  the  time  of <br/>initiation  the  shell  is  broke,  and  man  emerges  from  the  embryonic  state  of  physical  existence  wherein  he  had  remained <br/>through  the  fetal  period  of  philosophic  regeneration. <br/><br/><br/>The  Ancient  Mysteries  and  Secret  Societies <br/><br/><br/>Which  Have  Influenced  Modem  Masonic  Symbolism <br/><br/>p.  21 <br/><br/>WHEN  confronted  with  a  problem  involving  the  use  of  the  reasoning  faculties,  individuals  of  strong <br/>intellect  keep  their  poise,  and  seek  to  reach  a  solution  by  obtaining  facts  bearing  upon  the  question. <br/>Those  of  immature  mentality,  on  the  other  hand,  when  similarly  confronted,  are  overwhelmed.  While <br/>the  former  may  be  qualified  to  solve  the  riddle  of  their  own  destiny,  the  latter  must  be  led  like  a  flock <br/>of  sheep  and  taught  in  simple  language.  They  depend  almost  entirely  upon  the  ministrations  of  the <br/>shepherd.  The  Apostle  Paul  said  that  these  little  ones  must  be  fed  with  milk,  but  that  meat  is  the  food <br/>of  strong  men.  ThoughtZessness  is  almost  synonymous  with  childishness,  while  thought/iz/ness  is <br/>symbolic  of  maturity. <br/><br/>There  are,  however,  but  few  mature  minds  in  the  world;  and  thus  it  was  that  the  philosophic-religious <br/><br/>doctrines  of  the  pagans  were  divided  to  meet  the  needs  of  these  two  fundamental  groups  of  human <br/>intellect&#x2014;one  philosophic,  the  other  incapable  of  appreciating  the  deeper  mysteries  of  life.  To  the <br/>discerning  few  were  revealed  the  esoteric,  or  spiritual,  teachings,  while  the  unqualified  many  received <br/>only  the  literal,  or  exoteric,  interpretations.  In  order  to  make  simple  the  great  truths  of  Nature  and <br/>the  abstract  principles  of  natural  law,  the  vital  forces  of  the  universe  were  personified,  becoming  the <br/>gods  and  goddesses  of  the  ancient  mythologies.  While  the  ignorant  multitudes  brought  their  offerings <br/>to  the  altars  of  Priapus  and  Pan  (deities  representing  the  procreative  energies),  the  wise  recognized  in <br/>these  marble  statues  only  symbolic  concretions  of  great  abstract  truths. <br/><br/>In  all  cities  of  the  ancient  world  were  temples  for  public  worship  and  offering.  In  every  community <br/>also  were  philosophers  and  mystics,  deeply  versed  in  Nature's  lore.  These  individuals  were  usually <br/>banded  together,  forming  seclusive  philosophic  and  religious  schools.  The  more  important  of  these <br/>groups  were  known  as  the  Mysteries.  Many  of  the  great  minds  of  antiquity  were  initiated  into  these <br/>secret  fraternities  by  strange  and  mysterious  rites,  some  of  which  were  extremely  cruel.  Alexander <br/>Wilder  defines  the  Mysteries  as  &quot;Sacred  dramas  performed  at  stated  periods.  The  most  celebrated <br/>were  those  of  Isis,  Sabazius,  Cybele,  and  Eleusis.&quot;  After  being  admitted,  the  initiates  were  instructed <br/>in  the  secret  wisdom  which  had  been  preserved  for  ages.  Plato,  an  initiate  of  one  of  these  sacred <br/>orders,  was  severely  criticized  because  in  his  writings  he  revealed  to  the  public  many  of  the  secret <br/>philosophic  principles  of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>Every  pagan  nation  had  (and  has)  not  only  its  state  religion,  but  another  into  which  the  philosophic <br/><br/>elect  alone  have  gained  entrance.  Many  of  these  ancient  cults  vanished  from  the  earth  without <br/>revealing  their  secrets,  but  a  few  have  survived  the  test  of  ages  and  their  mysterious  symbols  are  still <br/>preserved.  Much  of  the  ritualism  of  Freemasonry  is  based  on  the  trials  to  which  candidates  were <br/>subjected  by  the  ancient  hierophants  before  the  keys  of  wisdom  were  entrusted  to  them. <br/><br/>Few  realize  the  extent  to  which  the  ancient  secret  schools  influenced  contemporary  intellects  and, <br/>through  those  minds,  posterity.  Robert  Macoy,  33&#x00b0;,  in  his  General  History  of  Freemasonry,  pays  a <br/>magnificent  tribute  to  the  part  played  by  the  ancient  Mysteries  in  the  rearing  of  the  edifice  of  human <br/>culture.  He  says,  in  part:  &quot;It  appears  that  all  the  perfection  of  civilization,  and  all  the  advancement <br/>made  in  philosophy,  science,  and  art  among  the  ancients  are  due  to  those  institutions  which,  under <br/>the  veil  of  mystery,  sought  to  illustrate  the  sublimest  truths  of  religion,  morality,  and  virtue,  and <br/>impress  them  on  the  hearts  of  their  disciples.*  *  *  Their  chief  object  was  to  teach  the  doctrine  of  one <br/>God,  the  resurrection  of  man  to  eternal  life,  the  dignity  of  the  human  soul,  and  to  lead  the  people  to <br/>see  the  shadow  of  the  deity,  in  the  beauty,  magnificence,  and  splendor  of  the  universe.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>With  the  dedine  of  virtue,  which  has  preceded  the  destruction  of  every  nation  of  history,  the <br/>Mysteries  became  perverted.  Sorcery  took  the  place  of  the  divine  magic.  Indescribable  practices  (such <br/>as  the  Bacchanalia)  were  introduced,  and  perversion  ruled  supreme;  for  no  institution  can  be  any <br/>better  than  the  members  of  which  it  is  composed.  In  despair,  the  few  who  were  true  sought  to <br/>preserve  the  secret  doctrines  from  oblivion.  In  some  cases  they  succeeded,  but  more  often  the <br/>arcanum  was  lost  and  only  the  empty  shell  of  the  Mysteries  remained. <br/><br/>Thomas  Taylor  has  written,  &quot;Man  is  naturally  a  religious  animal.&quot;  From  the  earliest  dawning  of  his <br/>consciousness,  man  has  worshiped  and  revered  things  as  symbolic  of  the  invisible,  omnipresent, <br/>indescribable  Thing,  concerning  which  he  could  discover  practically  nothing.  The  pagan  Mysteries <br/>opposed  the  Christians  during  the  early  centuries  of  their  church,  declaring  that  the  new  faith <br/>(Christianity)  did  not  demand  virtue  and  integrity  as  requisites  for  salvation.  Celsus  expressed <br/>himself  on  the  subject  in  the  following  caustic  terms: <br/><br/>&quot;That  I  do  not,  however,  accuse  the  Christians  more  bitterly  than  truth  compels,  may  be  conjectured <br/>from  hence,  that  the  cryers  who  call  men  to  other  mysteries  proclaim  as  follows:  'Let  him  approach <br/>whose  hands  are  pure,  and  whose  words  are  wise.'  And  again,  others  proclaim:  'Let  him  approach <br/>who  is  pure  from  all  wickedness,  whose  soul  is  not  conscious  of  any  evil,  and  who  leads  a  just  and <br/>upright  life.'  And  these  things  are  proclaimed  by  those  who  promise  a  purification  from  error.  Let  us <br/>now  hear  who  those  are  that  are  called  to  the  Christian  mysteries:  Whoever  is  a  sinner,  whoever  is <br/>unwise,  whoever  is  a  fool,  and  whoever,  in  short,  is  miserable,  him  the  kingdom  of  God  will  receive. <br/>Do  you  not,  therefore,  call  a  sinner,  an  unjust  man,  a  thief,  a  housebreaker,  a  wizard,  one  who  is <br/>sacrilegious,  and  a  robber  of  sepulchres?  What  other  persons  would  the  cryer  nominate,  who  should <br/>call  robbers  together?&quot; <br/><br/>It  was  not  the  true  faith  of  the  early  Christian  mystics  that  Celsus  attacked,  but  the  false  forms  that <br/>were  creeping  in  even  during  his  day.  The  ideals  of  early  Christianity  were  based  upon  the  high  moral <br/>standards  of  the  pagan  Mysteries,  and  the  first  Christians  who  met  under  the  city  of  Rome  used  as <br/>their  places  of  worship  the  subterranean  temples  of  Mithras,  from  whose  cult  has  been  borrowed <br/>much  of  the  sacerdotalism  of  the  modem  church. <br/><br/>The  ancient  philosophers  believed  that  no  man  could  live  intelligently  who  did  not  have  a <br/>fundamental  knowledge  of  Nature  and  her  laws.  Before  man  can  obey,  he  must  understand,  and  the <br/>Mysteries  were  devoted  to  instructing  man  concerning  the  operation  of  divine  law  in  the  terrestrial <br/>sphere.  Few  of  the  early  cults  actually  worshiped  anthropomorphic  deities,  although  their  symbolism <br/>might  lead  one  to  believe  they  did.  They  were  moralistic  rather  than  religionistic;  philosophic  rather <br/>than  theologic.  They  taught  man  to  use  his  faculties  more  intelligently,  to  be  patient  in  the  face  of <br/>adversity,  to  be  courageous  when  confronted  by  danger,  to  be  true  in  the  midst  of  temptation,  and, <br/>most  of  all,  to  view  a  worthy  life  as  the  most  acceptable  sacrifice  to  God,  and  his  body  as  an  altar <br/>sacred  to  the  Deity. <br/><br/>Sun  worship  played  an  important  part  in  nearly  all  the  early  pagan  Mysteries.  This  indicates  the <br/>probability  of  their  Atlantean  origin,  for  the  people  of  Atlantis  were  sun  worshipers.  The  Solar  Deity <br/>was  usually  personified  as  a  beautiful  youth,  with  long  golden  hair  to  symbolize  the  rays  of  the  sun. <br/>This  golden  Sun  God  was  slain  by  wicked  ruffians,  who  personified  the  evil  principle  of  the  universe. <br/>By  means  of  certain  rituals  and  ceremonies,  symbolic  of  purification  and  regeneration,  this  wonderful <br/>God  of  Good  was  brought  back  to  life  and  became  the  Savior  of  His  people.  The  secret  processes <br/>whereby  He  was  resurrected  symbolized  those  cultures  by  means  of  which  man  is  able  to  overcome <br/>his  lower  nature,  master  his  appetites,  and  give  expression  to  the  higher  side  of  himself.  The <br/>Mysteries  were  organized  for  the  purpose  of  assisting  the  struggling  human  creature  to  reawaken  the <br/>spiritual  powers  which,  surrounded  by  the  flaming <br/><br/><br/>A  FEMALE  HIEROPHANT  OF  THE  MYSTERIES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/>This  illustration  shows  Cybele,  here  called  the  Syrian  Goddess,  in  the  robes  of  a  hierophant.  Montfaucon  describes  the <br/>figure  as  follows:  &quot;Upon  her  head  is  an  episcopal  mitre,  adorned  on  the  lower  part  with  towers  and  pinnacles;  over  the <br/>gate  of  the  city  is  a  crescent,  and  beneath  the  circuit  of  the  walls  a  crown  of  rays.  The  Goddess  wears  a  sort  of  surplice, <br/>exactly  like  the  surplice  of  a  priest  or  bishop;  and  upon  the  surplice  a  tunic,  which  falls  down  to  the  legs;  and  over  all  an <br/>episcopal  cope,  with  the  twelve  signs  of  the  Zodiac  wrought  on  the  borders.  The  figure  hath  a  lion  on  each  side,  and  holds <br/>in  its  left  hand  a  Tympanum,  a  Sistrum,  a  Distaff,  a  Caduceus,  and  another  instrument.  In  her  right  hand  she  holds  with <br/>her  middle  finger  a  thunderbolt,  and  upon  the  same  am  animals,  insects,  and,  as  far  as  we  may  guess,  flowers,  fruit,  a  bow, <br/>a  quiver,  a  torch,  and  a  sc5^he.&quot;  The  whereabouts  of  the  statue  is  unknown,  the  copy  reproduced  by  Montfaucon  being <br/>from  drawings  by  Pirro  Ligorio. <br/><br/>p.  22 <br/><br/>ring  of  lust  and  degeneraq'^,  lay  asleep  within  his  soul.  In  other  words,  man  was  offered  a  way  by <br/>which  he  could  regain  his  lost  estate.  (See  Wagner's  Siegfried.) <br/><br/>In  the  ancient  world,  nearly  all  the  secret  societies  were  philosophic  and  religious.  During  the <br/>mediaeval  centuries,  they  were  chiefly  religious  and  political,  although  a  few  philosophic  schools <br/>remained.  In  modern  times,  secret  societies,  in  the  Occidental  countries,  are  largely  political  or <br/>fraternal,  although  in  a  few  of  them,  as  in  Masonry,  the  ancient  religious  and  philosophic  principles <br/>still  survive. <br/><br/>Space  prohibits  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  secret  schools.  There  were  literally  scores  of  these  ancient <br/>cults,  with  branches  in  all  parts  of  the  Eastern  and  Western  worlds.  Some,  such  as  those  of  Pythagoras <br/>and  the  Hermetists,  show  a  decided  Oriental  influence,  while  the  Rosicrucians,  according  to  their  own <br/>proclamations,  gained  much  of  their  wisdom  from  Arabian  mystics.  Although  the  Mystery  schools  are <br/>usually  associated  with  civilization,  there  is  evidence  that  the  most  uncivilized  peoples  of  prehistoric <br/>times  had  a  knowledge  of  them.  Natives  of  distant  islands,  many  in  the  lowest  forms  of  savagery,  have <br/>mystic  rituals  and  secret  practices  which,  although  primitive,  are  of  a  decided  Masonic  tinge. <br/><br/><br/>THE  DRUIDIC  MYSTERIES  OF  BRITAIN  AND  GAUL <br/><br/><br/>&quot;The  original  and  primitive  inhabitants  of  Britain,  at  some  remote  period,  revived  and  reformed  their <br/>national  institutes.  Their  priest,  or  instructor,  had  hitherto  been  simply  named  Gwydd,  but  it  was <br/>considered  to  have  become  necessary  to  divide  this  office  between  the  national,  or  superior,  priest <br/>and  another  whose  influence  [would]  be  more  limited.  From  henceforth  the  former  became  Der- <br/>Wydd  (Druid),  or  superior  instructor,  and  [the  latter]  Go-Wydd,  or  0-Vydd  (Ovate),  subordinate <br/>instructor;  and  both  went  by  the  general  name  of  Beirdd  (Bards),  or  teachers  of  wisdom.  As  the <br/>system  matured  and  augmented,  the  Bardic  Order  consisted  of  three  classes,  the  Druids,  Beirdd <br/>Braint,  or  privileged  Bards,  and  Ovates.&quot;  (See  Samuel  Meyrick  and  Charles  Smith,  The  Costume  of <br/>The  Original  Inhabitants  of  The  British  Islands.) <br/><br/>The  origin  of  the  word  Druid  is  under  dispute.  Max  Miiller  believes  that,  like  the  Irish  word  Drui,  it <br/>means  &quot;the  men  of  the  oak  trees.&quot;  He  further  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  forest  gods  and  tree <br/>deities  of  the  Greeks  were  called  dryades.  Some  believe  the  word  to  be  of  Teutonic  origin;  others <br/>ascribe  it  to  the  Welsh.  A  few  trace  it  to  the  Gaelic  druidh,  which  means  &quot;a  wise  man&quot;  or  &quot;a  sorcerer.&quot; <br/>In  Sanskrit  the  word  dm  means  &quot;timber.&quot; <br/><br/>At  the  time  of  the  Roman  conquest,  the  Druids  were  thoroughly  ensconced  in  Britain  and  Gaul.  Their <br/>power  over  the  people  was  unquestioned,  and  there  were  instances  in  which  armies,  about  to  attack <br/>each  other,  sheathed  their  swords  when  ordered  to  do  so  by  the  white-robed  Druids.  No  undertaking <br/>of  great  importance  was  scatted  without  the  assistance  of  these  patriarchs,  who  stood  as  mediators <br/>between  the  gods  and  men.  The  Druidic  Order  is  deservedly  credited  with  having  had  a  deep <br/>understanding  of  Nature  and  her  laws.  The  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  states  that  geography,  physical <br/>science,  natural  theology,  and  astrology  were  their  favorite  studies.  The  Druids  had  a  fundamental <br/>knowledge  of  medicine,  especially  the  use  of  herbs  and  simples.  Crude  surgical  instruments  also  have <br/>been  found  in  England  and  Ireland.  An  odd  treatise  on  early  British  medicine  states  that  every <br/>practitioner  was  expected  to  have  a  garden  or  back  yard  for  the  growing  of  certain  herbs  necessary  to <br/>his  profession.  Eliphas  Levi,  the  celebrated  transcendentalist,  makes  the  following  significant <br/>statement: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Druids  were  priests  and  physicians,  curing  by  magnetism  and  charging  amylets  with  their  fluidic <br/>influence.  Their  universal  remedies  were  mistletoe  and  serpents'  eggs,  because  these  substances <br/>attract  the  astral  light  in  a  special  manner.  The  solemnity  with  which  mistletoe  was  cut  down  drew <br/>upon  this  plant  the  popular  confidence  and  rendered  it  powerfully  magnetic.  *  *  *  The  progress  of <br/>magnetism  will  some  day  reveal  to  us  the  absorbing  properties  of  mistletoe.  We  shall  then  understand <br/>the  secret  of  those  spongy  growths  which  drew  the  unused  virtues  of  plants  and  become  surcharged <br/>with  tinctures  and  savors.  Mushrooms,  truffles,  gall  on  trees,  and  the  different  kinds  of  mistletoe  will <br/>be  employed  with  understanding  by  a  medical  science,  which  will  be  new  because  it  is  old  *  *  *  but <br/>one  must  not  move  quicker  than  science,  which  recedes  that  it  may  advance  the  further. &quot;  (See  The <br/>History  of  Magic.) <br/><br/>Not  only  was  the  mistletoe  sacred  as  symbolic  of  the  universal  medicine,  or  panacea,  but  also  because <br/>of  the  fact  that  it  grew  upon  the  oak  tree.  Through  the  symbol  of  the  oak,  the  Druids  worshiped  the <br/>Supreme  Deity;  therefore,  anything  growing  upon  that  tree  was  sacred  to  Him.  At  certain  seasons, <br/>according  to  the  positions  of  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars,  the  Arch-Druid  climbed  the  oak  tree  and  cut <br/>the  mistletoe  with  a  golden  sickle  consecrated  for  that  service.  The  parasitic  growth  was  caught  in <br/>white  cloths  provided  for  the  purpose,  lest  it  touch  the  earth  and  be  polluted  by  terrestrial  vibrations. <br/>Usually  a  sacrifice  of  a  white  bull  was  made  under  the  tree. <br/><br/>The  Druids  were  initiates  of  a  secret  school  that  existed  in  their  midst.  This  school,  which  closely <br/>resembled  the  Bacchic  and  Eleusinian  Mysteries  of  Greece  or  the  Egyptian  rites  of  Isis  and  Osiris,  is <br/>justly  designated  the  Druidic  Mysteries.  There  has  been  much  speculation  concerning  the  secret <br/><br/><br/>wisdom  that  the  Druids  claimed  to  possess.  Their  secret  teachings  were  never  written,  but  were <br/>communicated  orally  to  specially  prepared  candidates.  Robert  Brown,  32&#x00b0;,  is  of  the  opinion  that  the <br/>British  priests  secured  their  information  from  Tyrian  and  Phoenician  navigators  who,  thousands  of <br/>years  before  the  Christian  Era,  established  colonies  in  Britain  and  Gaul  while  searching  for  tin. <br/>Thomas  Maurice,  in  his  Indian  Antiquities,  discourses  at  length  on  Phcenician,  Carthaginian,  and <br/>Greek  expeditions  to  the  British  Isles  for  the  purpose  of  procuring  tin.  Others  are  of  the  opinion  that <br/>the  Mysteries  as  celebrated  by  the  Druids  were  of  Oriental  origin,  possibly  Buddhistic. <br/><br/>The  proximity  of  the  British  Isles  to  the  lost  Atlantis  may  account  for  the  sun  worship  which  plays  an <br/>important  part  in  the  rituals  of  Druidism.  According  to  Artemidorus,  Ceres  and  Persephone  were <br/>worshiped  on  an  island  close  to  Britain  with  rites  and  ceremonies  similar  to  those  of  Samothrace. <br/>There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Druidic  Pantheon  includes  a  large  number  of  Greek  and  Roman  deities. <br/>This  greatly  amazed  Caesar  during  his  conquest  of  Britain  and  Gaul,  and  caused  him  to  affirm  that <br/>these  tribes  adored  Mercury,  Apollo,  Mars,  and  Jupiter,  in  a  manner  similar  to  that  of  the  Latin <br/>countries.  It  is  almost  certain  that  the  Druidic  Mysteries  were  not  indigenous  to  Britain  or  Gaul,  but <br/>migrated  from  one  of  the  more  ancient  civilizations. <br/><br/>The  school  of  the  Druids  was  divided  into  three  distinct  parts,  and  the  secret  teachings  embodied <br/>therein  are  practically  the  same  as  the  mysteries  concealed  under  the  allegories  of  Blue  Lodge <br/>Masonry.  The  lowest  of  the  three  divisions  was  that  of  Ovate  (Ovydd).  This  was  an  honorary  degree, <br/>requiring  no  special  purification  or  preparation.  The  Ovates  dressed  in  green,  the  Druidic  color  of <br/>learning,  and  were  expected  to  know  something  about  medicine,  astronomy,  poetry  if  possible,  and <br/>sometimes  music.  An  Ovate  was  an  individual  admitted  to  the  Druidic  Order  because  of  his  general <br/>excellence  and  superior  knowledge  concerning  the  problems  of  life. <br/><br/>The  second  division  was  that  of  Bard  (Beirdd).  Its  members  were  robed  in  sky-blue,  to  represent <br/>harmony  and  truth,  and  to  them  was  assigned  the  labor  of  memorizing,  at  least  in  part,  the  twenty <br/>thousand  verses  of  Druidic  sacred  poetry.  They  were  often  pictured  with  the  primitive  British  or  Irish <br/>harp~an  instrument  strung  with  human  hair,  and  having  as  many  strings  as  there  were  ribs  on  one <br/>side  of  the  human  body.  These  Bards  were  often  chosen  as  teachers  of  candidates  seeking  entrance <br/>into  the  Druidic  Mysteries.  Neophytes  wore  striped  robes  of  blue,  green,  and  white,  these  being  the <br/>three  sacred  colors  of  the  Druidic  Order. <br/><br/>The  third  division  was  that  of  Druid  (Derwyddon).  Its  particular  labor  was  to  minister  to  the  religious <br/>needs  of  the  people.  To  reach  this  dignity,  the  candidate  must  first  become  a  Bard  Braint.  The  Druids <br/>always  dressed  in  white&#x2014;symbolic  of  their  purity,  and  the  color  used  by  them  to  symbolize  the  sun. <br/><br/>In  order  to  reach  the  exalted  position  of  Arch-Druid,  or  spiritual  head  of  the  organization,  it  was <br/>necessary  for  a  priest  to  pass  through  the  six  successive  degrees  of  the  Druidic  Order.  (The  members <br/>of  the  different  degrees  were  differentiated  by  the  colors  of  their  sashes,  for  all  of  them  wore  robes  of <br/>white.)  Some  writers  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  title  oi  Arch-Druid  was  hereditary,  descending  from <br/>father  to  son,  but  it  is  more  probable  that  the  honor  was  conferred  by  ballot  election.  Its  recipient  was <br/>chosen  for  his  virtues  and <br/><br/><br/>THE  ARCH-DRUID  IN  HIS  CEREMONIAL  ROBES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Wellcome's  Ancient  Cymric  Medicine. <br/><br/>The  most  striking  adornment  of  the  Arch- Druid  was  the  iodhan  moron,  or  breastplate  of  judgment,  which  possessed  the <br/>mysterious  Power  of  strangling  any  who  made  an  untrue  statement  while  wearing  it.  Godfrey  Higgins  states  that  this <br/>breastplate  was  put  on  the  necks  of  witnesses  to  test  the  veracity  of  their  evidence.  The  Druidic  tiara,  or  anguinum,  its <br/>front  embossed  with  a  number  of  points  to  represent  the  sun's  rays,  indicated  that  the  priest  was  a  personification  of  the <br/>rising  sun.  On  the  front  of  his  belt  the  Arch-Druid  wore  the  liath  meisicith--a  magic  brooch,  or  buckle  in  the  center  of <br/>which  was  a  large  white  stone.  To  this  was  attributed  the  power  of  drawing  the  fire  of  the  gods  down  from  heaven  at  the <br/>priest's  command  This  specially  cut  stone  was  a  burning  glass,  by  which  the  sun's  rays  were  concentrated  to  light  the  altar <br/>fires.  The  Druids  also  had  other  symbolic  implements,  such  as  the  peculiarly  shaped  golden  sickle  with  which  they  cut  the <br/>mistletoe  from  the  oak,  and  the  coman,  or  scepter,  in  the  form  of  a  crescent,  symbolic  of  the  sixth  day  of  the  increasing <br/>moon  and  also  of  the  Ark  of  Noah.  An  early  initiate  of  the  Druidic  Mysteries  related  that  admission  to  their  midnight <br/>ceremony  was  gained  by  means  of  a  glass  boat,  called  Cwrwg  Gwydrin.  This  boat  symbolized  the  moon,  which,  floating <br/>upon  the  waters  of  eternity,  preserved  the  seeds  of  living  creatures  within  its  boatlike  crescent. <br/><br/>p-  23 <br/><br/>integrity  from  the  most  learned  members  of  the  higher  Druidic  degrees. <br/><br/>According  to  James  Gardner,  there  were  usually  two  Arch-Druids  in  Britain,  one  residing  on  the  Isle <br/>of  Anglesea  and  the  other  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  Presumably  there  were  others  in  Gaul.  These  dignitaries <br/>generally  carried  golden  scepters  and  were  crowned  with  wreaths  of  oak  leaves,  symbolic  of  their <br/>authority.  The  younger  members  of  the  Druidic  Order  were  clean-shaven  and  modestly  dressed,  but <br/>the  more  aged  had  long  gray  beards  and  wore  magnificent  golden  ornaments.  The  educational  system <br/>of  the  Druids  in  Britain  was  superior  to  that  of  their  colleagues  on  the  Continent,  and  consequently <br/>many  of  the  Gallic  youths  were  sent  to  the  Druidic  colleges  in  Britain  for  their  philosophical <br/>instruction  and  training. <br/><br/>Eliphas  Levi  states  that  the  Druids  lived  in  strict  abstinence,  studied  the  natural  sciences,  preserved <br/>the  deepest  secrecy,  and  admitted  new  members  only  after  long  probationary  periods.  Many  of  the <br/>priests  of  the  order  lived  in  buildings  not  unlike  the  monasteries  of  the  modern  world.  They  were <br/>associated  in  groups  like  ascetics  of  the  Far  East.  Although  celibacy  was  not  demanded  of  them,  few <br/>married.  Many  of  the  Druids  retired  from  the  world  and  lived  as  recluses  in  caves,  in  rough-stone <br/><br/><br/>houses,  or  in  little  shacks  built  in  the  depths  of  a  forest.  Here  they  prayed  and  medicated,  emerging <br/>only  to  perform  their  religious  duties. <br/><br/>James  Freeman  Clarke,  in  his  Ten  Great  Religions,  describes  the  beliefs  of  the  Druids  as  follows:  &quot;The <br/>Druids  believed  in  three  worlds  and  in  transmigration  from  one  to  the  other:  In  a  world  above  this,  in <br/>which  happiness  predominated;  a  world  below,  of  misery;  and  this  present  state.  This  transmigration <br/>was  to  punish  and  reward  and  also  to  purify  the  soul.  In  the  present  world,  said  they,  Good  and  Evil <br/>are  so  exactly  balanced  that  man  has  the  utmost  freedom  and  is  able  to  choose  or  reject  either.  The <br/>Welsh  Triads  tell  us  there  are  three  objects  of  metempsychosis:  to  collect  into  the  soul  the  properties <br/>of  all  being,  to  acquire  a  knowledge  of  all  things,  and  to  get  power  to  conquer  evil.  There  are  also,  they <br/>say,  three  kinds  of  knowledge:  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  each  thing,  of  its  cause,  and  its  influence. <br/>There  are  three  things  which  continually  grow  less:  darkness,  falsehood,  and  death.  There  are  three <br/>which  constantly  increase:  light,  life,  and  truth.&quot; <br/><br/>Like  nearly  all  schools  of  the  Mysteries,  the  teachings  of  the  Druids  were  divided  into  two  distinct <br/>sections.  The  simpler,  a  moral  code,  was  taught  to  all  the  people,  while  the  deeper,  esoteric  doctrine <br/>was  given  only  to  initiated  priests.  To  be  admitted  to  the  order,  a  candidate  was  required  to  be  of  good <br/>family  and  of  high  moral  character.  No  important  secrets  were  intrusted  to  him  until  he  had  been <br/>tempted  in  many  ways  and  his  strength  of  character  severely  tried.  The  Druids  taught  the  people  of <br/>Britain  and  Gaul  concerning  the  immortality  of  the  soul.  They  believed  in  transmigration  and <br/>apparently  in  reincarnation.  They  borrowed  in  one  life,  promising  to  pay  back  in  the  next.  They <br/>believed  in  a  purgatorial  type  of  hell  where  they  would  be  purged  of  their  sins,  afterward  passing  on  to <br/>the  happiness  of  unity  with  the  gods.  The  Druids  taught  that  all  men  would  be  saved,  but  that  some <br/>must  return  to  earth  many  times  to  learn  the  lessons  of  human  life  and  to  overcome  the  inherent  evil <br/>of  their  own  natures. <br/><br/>Before  a  candidate  was  intrusted  with  the  secret  doctrines  of  the  Druids,  he  was  bound  with  a  vow  of <br/>secrecy.  These  doctrines  were  imparted  only  in  the  depths  of  forests  and  in  the  darkness  of  caves.  In <br/>these  places,  far  from  the  haunts  of  men,  the  neophyte  was  instructed  concerning  the  creation  of  the <br/>universe,  the  personalities  of  the  gods,  the  laws  of  Nature,  the  secrets  of  occult  medicine,  the <br/>mysteries  of  the  celestial  bodies,  and  the  rudiments  of  magic  and  sorcery.  The  Druids  had  a  great <br/>number  of  feast  days.  The  new  and  full  moon  and  the  sixth  day  of  the  moon  were  sacred  periods.  It  is <br/>believed  that  initiations  took  place  only  at  the  two  solstices  and  the  two  equinoxes.  At  dawn  of  the <br/>25th  day  of  December,  the  birth  of  the  Sun  God  was  celebrated. <br/><br/>The  secret  teachings  of  the  Druids  are  said  by  some  to  be  tinctured  with  Pythagorean  philosophy.  The <br/>Druids  had  a  Madonna,  or  Virgin  Mother,  with  a  Child  in  her  arms,  who  was  sacred  to  their  Mysteries; <br/>and  their  Sun  God  was  resurrected  at  the  time  of  the  year  corresponding  to  that  at  which  modern <br/>Christians  celebrate  Easter. <br/><br/>Both  the  cross  and  the  serpent  were  sacred  to  the  Druids,  who  made  the  former  by  cutting  off  all  the <br/>branches  of  an  oak  tree  and  fastening  one  of  them  to  the  main  trunk  in  the  form  of  the  letter  T.  This <br/>oaken  cross  became  symbolic  of  their  superior  Deity.  They  also  worshiped  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars. <br/>The  moon  received  their  special  veneration.  Caesar  stated  that  Mercury  was  one  of  the  chief  deities  of <br/>the  Gauls.  The  Druids  are  believed  to  have  worshiped  Mercury  under  the  similitude  of  a  stone  cube. <br/>They  also  had  great  veneration  for  the  Nature  spirits  (fairies,  gnomes,  and  undines),  little  creatures  of <br/>the  forests  and  rivers  to  whom  many  offerings  were  made.  Describing  the  temples  of  the  Druids, <br/>Charles  Heckethorn,  in  The  Secret  Societies  of  All  Ages  &amp;  Countries,  says: <br/><br/>&quot;Their  temples  wherein  the  sacred  fire  was  preserved  were  generally  situate  on  eminences  and  in <br/>dense  groves  of  oak,  and  assumed  various  forms&#x2014;circular,  because  a  circle  was  the  emblem  of  the <br/>universe;  oval,  in  allusion  to  the  mundane  egg,  from  which  issued,  according  to  the  traditions  of  many <br/>nations,  the  universe,  or,  according  to  others,  our  first  parents;  serpentine,  because  a  serpent  was  the <br/><br/><br/>symbol  of  Hu,  the  Dniidic  Osiris;  cruciform,  because  a  cross  is  an  emblem  of  regeneration;  or  winged, <br/>to  represent  the  motion  of  the  Divine  Spirit.  *  *  *  Their  chief  deities  were  reducible  to  two~a  male  and <br/>a  female,  the  great  father  and  mother~Hu  and  Ceridwen,  distinguished  by  the  same  characteristics  as <br/>belong  to  Osiris  and  Isis,  Bacchus  and  Ceres,  or  any  other  supreme  god  and  goddess  representing  the <br/>two  principles  of  all  Being.&quot; <br/><br/>Godfrey  Higgins  states  that  Hu,  the  Mighty,  regarded  as  the  first  settler  of  Britain,  came  from  a  place <br/>which  the  Welsh  Triads  call  the  Summer  Country,  the  present  site  of  Constantinople.  Albert  Pike  says <br/>that  the  Lost  Word  of  Masonry  is  concealed  in  the  name  of  the  Druid  god  Hu.  The  meager <br/>information  extant  concerning  the  secret  initiations  of  the  Druids  indicates  a  decided  similarity <br/>between  their  Mystery  school  and  the  schools  of  Greece  and  Egypt.  Hu,  the  Sun  God,  was  murdered <br/>and,  after  a  number  of  strange  ordeals  and  mystic  rituals,  was  restored  to  life. <br/><br/>There  were  three  degrees  of  the  Druidic  Mysteries,  but  few  successfully  passed  them  all.  The <br/>candidate  was  buried  in  a  coffin,  as  symbolic  of  the  death  of  the  Sun  God.  The  supreme  test,  however, <br/>was  being  sent  out  to  sea  in  an  open  boat.  While  undergoing  this  ordeal,  many  lost  their  lives.  Taliesin, <br/>an  ancient  scholar,  who  passed  through  the  Mysteries,  describes  the  initiation  of  the  open  boat  in <br/>Faber's  Pagan  Idolatry.  The  few  who  passed  this  third  degree  were  said  to  have  been  &quot;born  again,&quot; <br/>and  were  instructed  in  the  secret  and  hidden  truths  which  the  Druid  priests  had  preserved  from <br/>antiquity.  From  these  initiates  were  chosen  many  of  the  dignitaries  of  the  British  religious  and <br/>political  world.  (For  further  details,  see  Faber's  Pagan  Idolatry,  Albert  Pike's  Morals  and  Dogma, <br/>and  Godfrey  Higgins'  Celtic  Druids.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  RITES  OF  MITHRAS <br/><br/><br/>When  the  Persian  Mysteries  immigrated  into  Southern  Europe,  they  were  quickly  assimilated  by  the <br/>Latin  mind.  The  cult  grew  rapidly,  especially  among  the  Roman  soldiery,  and  during  the  Roman  wars <br/>of  conquest  the  teachings  were  carried  by  the  legionaries  to  nearly  all  parts  of  Europe.  So  powerful <br/>did  the  cult  of  Mithras  become  that  at  least  one  Roman  Emperor  was  initiated  into  the  order,  which <br/>met  in  caverns  under  the  city  of  Rome.  Concerning  the  spread  of  this  Mystery  school  through <br/>different  parts  of  Europe,  C.  W.  King,  in  his  Gnostics  and  Their  Remains,  says: <br/><br/>&quot;Mithraic  bas-reliefs  cut  on  the  faces  of  rocks  or  on  stone  tablets  still  abound  in  the  countries <br/>formerly  the  western  provinces  of  the  Roman  Empire;  many  exist  in  Germany,  still  more  in  France, <br/>and  in  this  island  (Britain)  they  have  often  been  discovered  on  the  line  of  the  Picts'  Wall  and  the <br/>noted  one  at  Bath.&quot; <br/><br/>Alexander  Wilder,  in  his  Philosophy  and  Ethics  of  the  Zoroasters,  states  that  Mithras  is  the  Zend  title <br/>for  the  sun,  and  he  is  supposed  to  dwell  within  that  shining  orb.  Mithras  has  a  male  and  a  female <br/>aspect,  though  not  himself  androgynous.  As  Mithras,  he  is  the  ford  of  the  sun,  powerful  and  radiant, <br/>and  most  magnificent  of  the  Yazatas  (Izads,  or  Genii,  of  the  sun).  As  Mithra,  this  deity  represents  the <br/>feminine  principle;  the  mundane  universe  is  recognized  as  her  symbol.  She  represents  Nature  as <br/>receptive  and  terrestrial,  and  as  fruitful  only  when  bathed  in  the  glory  of  the  solar  orb.  The  Mithraic <br/>cult  is  a  simplification  of  the  more  elaborate  teachings  of  Zarathustra  (Zoroaster),  the  Persian  fire <br/>magician. <br/><br/><br/>THE  GROUND  PLAN  OF  STONEHENGE. <br/><br/>From  Maurice's  Indian  Antiquities. <br/><br/>The  Druid  temples  of  places  of  religious  worship  were  not  patterned  after  those  of  other  nations.  Most  of  their  ceremonies <br/>were  performed  at  night,  either  in  thick  groves  of  oak  trees  or  around  open-air  altars  built  of  great  uncut  stones.  How <br/>these  masses  of  rock  were  moved  ahs  not  been  satisfactorily  explained.  The  most  famous  of  their  altars,  a  great  stone  ring <br/>of  rocks,  is  Stonehenge,  in  Southwestern  England.  This  structure,  laid  out  on  an  astronomical  basis,  still  stands,  a  wonder <br/>of  antiquity. <br/><br/>p.  24 <br/><br/>According  to  the  Persians,  there  coexisted  in  eternity  two  principles.  The  first  of  these,  Ahura-Mazda, <br/>or  Ormuzd,  was  the  Spirit  of  Good.  From  Ormuzd  came  forth  a  number  of  hierarchies  of  good  and <br/>beautiful  spirits  (angels  and  archangels).  The  second  of  these  eternally  existing  principles  was  called <br/>Ahriman.  He  was  also  a  pure  and  beautiful  spirit,  but  he  later  rebelled  against  Ormuzd,  being  jealous <br/>of  his  power.  This  did  not  occur,  however,  until  after  Ormuzd  had  created  light,  for  previously <br/>Ahriman  had  not  been  conscious  of  the  existence  of  Ormuzd.  Because  of  his  jealousy  and  rebellion, <br/>Ahriman  became  the  Spirit  of  Evil.  From  himself  he  individualized  a  host  of  destructive  creatures  to <br/>injure  Ormuzd. <br/><br/>When  Ormuzd  created  the  earth,  Ahriman  entered  into  its  grosser  elements.  Whenever  Ormuzd  did  a <br/>good  deed,  Ahriman  placed  the  principle  of  evil  within  it.  At  last  when  Ormuzd  created  the  human <br/>race,  Ahriman  became  incarnate  in  the  lower  nature  of  man  so  that  in  each  personality  the  Spirit  of <br/>Good  and  the  Spirit  of  Evil  struggle  for  control.  For  3,000  years  Ormuzd  ruled  the  celestial  worlds <br/>with  light  and  goodness.  Then  he  created  man.  For  another  3,000  years  he  ruled  man  with  wisdom, <br/>and  integrity.  Then  the  power  of  Ahriman  began,  and  the  struggle  for  the  soul  of  man  continues <br/>through  the  next  period  of  3,000  years.  During  the  fourth  period  of  3,000  years,  the  power  of <br/>Ahriman  will  be  destroyed.  Good  will  return  to  the  world  again,  evil  and  death  will  be  vanquished, <br/>and  at  last  the  Spirit  of  Evil  will  bow  humbly  before  the  throne  of  Ormuzd.  While  Ormuzd  and <br/>Ahriman  are  struggling  for  control  of  the  human  soul  and  for  supremacy  in  Nature,  Mithras,  God  of <br/>Intelligence,  stands  as  mediator  between  the  two.  Many  authors  have  noted  the  similarity  between <br/>mercury  and  Mithras.  As  the  chemical  mercury  acts  as  a  solvent  (according  to  alchemists),  so  Mithras <br/>seeks  to  harmonize  the  two  celestial  opposites. <br/><br/>There  are  many  points  of  resemblance  between  Christianity  and  the  cult  of  Mithras.  One  of  the <br/>reasons  for  this  probably  is  that  the  Persian  mystics  invaded  Italy  during  the  first  century  after  Christ <br/><br/><br/>and  the  early  history  of  both  cults  was  closely  interwoven.  The  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  makes  the <br/>following  statement  concerning  the  Mithraic  and  Christian  Mysteries: <br/><br/>&quot;The  fraternal  and  democratic  spirit  of  the  first  communities,  and  their  humble  origin;  the <br/>identification  of  the  object  of  adoration  with  light  and  the  sun;  the  legends  of  the  shepherds  with  their <br/>gifts  and  adoration,  the  flood,  and  the  ark;  the  representation  in  art  of  the  fiery  chariot,  the  drawing  of <br/>water  from  the  rock;  the  use  of  bell  and  candle,  holy  water  and  the  communion;  the  sanctification  of <br/>Sunday  and  of  the  25th  of  December;  the  insistence  on  moral  conduct,  the  emphasis  placed  on <br/>abstinence  and  self-control;  the  doctrine  of  heaven  and  hell,  of  primitive  revelation,  of  the  mediation <br/>of  the  Logos  emanating  from  the  divine,  the  atoning  sacrifice,  the  constant  warfare  between  good  and <br/>evil  and  the  final  triumph  of  the  former,  the  immortality  of  the  soul,  the  last  judgment,  the <br/>resurrection  of  the  flesh  and  the  fiery  destruction  of  the  universe&#x2014; [these]  are  some  of  the <br/>resemblances  which,  whether  real  or  only  apparent,  enabled  Mithraism  to  prolong  its  resistance  to <br/>Christianity,&quot; <br/><br/>The  rites  of  Mithras  were  performed  in  caves.  Porphyry,  in  his  Cave  of  the  Nymphs,  states  that <br/>Zarathustra  (Zoroaster)  was  the  first  to  consecrate  a  cave  to  the  worship  of  God,  because  a  cavern  was <br/>symbolic  of  the  earth,  or  the  lower  world  of  darkness.  John  P.  Lundy,  in  his  Monumental  Christianity, <br/>describes  the  cave  of  Mithras  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;But  this  cave  was  adorned  with  the  signs  of  the  zodiac.  Cancer  and  Capricorn.  The  summer  and <br/>winter  solstices  were  chiefly  conspicuous,  as  the  gates  of  souls  descending  into  this  life,  or  passing  out <br/>of  it  in  their  ascent  to  the  Gods;  Cancer  being  the  gate  of  descent,  and  Capricorn  of  ascent.  These  are <br/>the  two  avenues  of  the  immortals  passing  up  and  down  from  earth  to  heaven,  and  from  heaven  to <br/>earth.&quot; <br/><br/>The  so-called  chair  of  St.  Peter,  in  Rome,  was  believed  to  have  been  used  in  one  of  the  pagan <br/>Mysteries,  possibly  that  of  Mithras,  in  whose  subterranean  grottoes  the  votaries  of  the  Christian <br/>Mysteries  met  in  the  early  days  of  their  faith.  In  Anacalypsis,  Godfrey  Higgins  writes  that  in  1662, <br/>while  cleaning  this  sacred  chair  of  Bar-Jonas,  the  Twelve  Labors  of  Hercules  were  discovered  upon  it, <br/>and  that  later  the  French  discovered  upon  the  same  chair  the  Mohammedan  confession  of  faith, <br/>written  in  Arabic. <br/><br/>Initiation  into  the  rites  of  Mithras,  like  initiation  into  many  other  ancient  schools  of  philosophy, <br/>apparently  consisted  of  three  important  degrees.  Preparation  for  these  degrees  consisted  of  self- <br/>purification,  the  building  up  of  the  intellectual  powers,  and  the  control  of  the  animal  nature.  In  the <br/>first  degree  the  candidate  was  given  a  crown  upon  the  point  of  a  sword  and  instructed  in  the <br/>mysteries  of  Mithras'  hidden  power.  Probably  he  was  taught  that  the  golden  crown  represented  his <br/>own  spiritual  nature,  which  must  be  objectified  and  unfolded  before  he  could  truly  glorify  Mithras; <br/>for  Mithras  was  his  own  soul,  standing  as  mediator  between  Ormuzd,  his  spirit,  and  Ahriman,  his <br/>animal  nature.  In  the  second  degree  he  was  given  the  armor  of  intelligence  and  purity  and  sent  into <br/>the  darkness  of  subterranean  pits  to  fight  the  beasts  of  lust,  passion,  and  degeneracy.  In  the  third <br/>degree  he  was  given  a  cape,  upon  which  were  drawn  or  woven  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  and  other <br/>astronomical  symbols.  After  his  initiations  were  over,  he  was  hailed  as  one  who  had  risen  from  the <br/>dead,  was  instructed  in  the  secret  teachings  of  the  Persian  mystics,  and  became  a  full-fledged  member <br/>of  the  order.  Candidates  who  successfully  passed  the  Mithraic  initiations  were  called  Lions  and  were <br/>marked  upon  their  foreheads  with  the  Egyptian  cross.  Mithras  himself  is  often  pictured  with  the  head <br/>of  a  lion  and  two  pairs  of  wings.  Throughout  the  entire  ritual  were  repeated  references  to  the  birth  of <br/>Mithras  as  the  Sun  God,  his  sacrifice  for  man,  his  death  that  men  might  have  eternal  life,  and  lastly, <br/>his  resurrection  and  the  saving  of  all  humanity  by  his  intercession  before  the  throne  of  Ormuzd.  (See <br/>Heckethorn.) <br/><br/><br/>While  the  cult  of  Mithras  did  not  reach  the  philosophic  heights  attained  by  Zarathustra,  its  effect <br/><br/>upon  the  civilization  of  the  Western  world  was  far-reaching,  for  at  one  time  nearly  all  Europe  was <br/>converted  to  its  doctrines.  Rome,  in  her  intercourse  with  other  nations,  inoculated  them  with  her <br/>religious  principles;  and  many  later  institutions  have  exhibited  Mithraic  culture.  The  reference  to  the <br/>&quot;Lion&quot;  and  the  &quot;Grip  of  the  Lion's  Paw&quot;  in  the  Master  Mason's  degree  have  a  strong  Mithraic  tinge <br/>and  may  easily  have  originated  from  this  cult.  A  ladder  of  seven  rungs  appears  in  the  Mithraic <br/>initiation.  Faber  is  of  the  opinion  that  this  ladder  was  originally  a  pyramid  of  seven  steps.  It  is <br/>possible  that  the  Masonic  ladder  with  seven  rungs  had  its  origin  in  this  Mithraic  symbol.  Women <br/>were  never  permitted  to  enter  the  Mithraic  Order,  but  children  of  the  male  sex  were  initiates  long <br/>before  they  reached  maturity.  The  refusal  to  permit  women  to  join  the  Masonic  Order  may  be  based <br/>on  the  esoteric  reason  given  in  the  secret  instructions  of  the  Mithraics.  This  cult  is  another  excellent <br/>example  of  those  secret  societies  whose  legends  are  largely  symbolic  representations  of  the  sun  and <br/>his  journey  through  the  houses  of  the  heavens.  Mithras,  rising  from  a  stone,  is  merely  the  sun  rising <br/>over  the  horizon,  or,  as  the  ancients  supposed,  out  of  the  horizon,  at  the  vernal  equinox. <br/><br/>John  O'Neill  disputes  the  theory  that  Mithras  was  intended  as  a  solar  deity.  In  The  Night  of  the  Gods <br/>he  writes:  &quot;The  Avestan  Mithra,  the  yazata  of  light,  has  '10,000  eyes,  high,  with  full  knowledge <br/>(perethuvaedayana),  strong,  sleepless  and  ever  awake  (jaghaurvaunghem).'The  supreme  god  Ahura <br/>Mazda  also  has  one  Eye,  or  else  it  is  said  that  'with  his  eyes,  the  sun,  moon  and  stars,  he  sees <br/>everything.'  The  theory  that  Mithra  was  originally  a  title  of  the  supreme  heavens-god~putting  the <br/>sun  out  of  court&#x2014;is  the  only  one  that  answers  all  requirements.  It  will  be  evident  that  here  we  have <br/>origins  in  abundance  for  the  Freemason's  Eye  and  'its  nunquam  dormio.'&quot;  The  reader  must  nor <br/>confuse  the  Persian  Mithra  with  the  Vedic  Mitra.  According  to  Alexander  Wilder,  &quot;The  Mithraic  rites <br/>superseded  the  Mysteries  of  Bacchus,  and  became  the  foundation  of  the  Gnostic  system,  which  for <br/>many  centuries  prevailed  in  Asia,  Egypt,  and  even  the  remote  West.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>SOLIJNVICTO         DEO  ^ <br/><br/><br/>MITHRAS  SLAYING  THE  BULL. <br/><br/>From  Lundy's  Monumental  Christianity. <br/><br/>The  most  famous  sculpturings  and  reliefs  of  this  prototokos  show  Mithras  kneehng  upon  the  recumbent  form  of  a  great <br/>bull,  into  whose  throat  he  is  driving  a  sword.  The  slaying  of  the  bull  signifies  that  the  rays  of  the  sun,  symbolized  by  the <br/>sword,  release  at  the  vernal  equinox  the  vital  essences  of  the  earth&#x2014;the  blood  of  the  bull&#x2014;which,  pouring  from  the  wound <br/>made  by  the  Sun  God,  fertilize  the  seeds  of  living  things.  Dogs  were  held  sacred  to  the  cult  of  Mithras,  being  symbolic  of <br/>sincerity  and  trustworthiness.  The  Mithraics  used  the  serpent  a  an  emblem  of  Ahriman,  the  Spirit  of  Evil,  and  water  rats <br/>were  held  sacred  to  him.  The  bull  is  esoterically  the  Constellation  of  Taurus;  the  serpent,  its  opposite  in  the  zodiac, <br/><br/><br/>Scorpio;  the  sun,  Mithras,  entering  into  the  side  of  the  bull,  slays  the  celestial  creature  and  nourishes  the  universe  with  its <br/>blood. <br/><br/><br/>THE  BIRTH  OF  MITHRAS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities <br/><br/>Mithras  was  born  out  of  a  rock,  which,  breaking  open,  permitted  him  to  emerge.  This  occurred  in  the  darkness  of  a <br/>subterranean  chamber.  The  Church  of  the  Nativity  at  Bethlehem  confirms  the  theory  that  Jesus  was  born  in  a  grotto,  or <br/>cave.  According  to  Dupuis,  Mithras  was  put  to  death  by  crucifixion  and  rose  again  on  the  third  day. <br/><br/><br/>&#x2022;25 <br/><br/>The  Ancient  Mysteries  and  Secret  Societies <br/><br/>Part  Two <br/><br/>THE  entire  history  of  Christian  and  pagan  Gnosticism  is  shrouded  in  the  deepest  mystery  and <br/>obscurity;  for,  while  the  Gnostics  were  undoubtedly  prolific  writers,  little  of  their  literature  has <br/>survived.  They  brought  down  upon  themselves  the  animosity  of  the  early  Christian  Church,  and  when <br/>this  institution  reached  its  position  of  world  power  it  destroyed  all  available  records  of  the  Gnostic <br/>cultus.  The  name  Gnostic  means  wisdom,  or  knowledge,  and  is  derived  from  the  Greek  Gnosis.  The <br/>members  of  the  order  claimed  to  be  familiar  with  the  secret  doctrines  of  early  Christianity.  They <br/>interpreted  the  Christian  Mysteries  according  to  pagan  symbolism.  Their  secret  information  and <br/>philosophic  tenets  they  concealed  from  the  profane  and  taught  to  a  small  group  only  of  especially <br/>initiated  persons. <br/><br/>Simon  Magus,  the  magician  of  New  Testament  fame,  is  often  supposed  to  have  been  the  founder  of <br/>Gnosticism.  If  this  be  true,  the  sect  was  formed  during  the  century  after  Christ  and  is  probably  the <br/>first  of  the  many  branches  which  have  sprung  from  the  main  trunk  of  Christianity.  Everything  with <br/>which  the  enthusiasts  of  the  early  Christian  Church  might  not  agree  they  declared  to  be  inspired  by <br/>the  Devil.  That  Simon  Magus  had  mysterious  and  supernatural  powers  is  conceded  even  by  his <br/>enemies,  but  they  maintained  that  these  powers  were  lent  to  him  by  the  infernal  spirits  and  furies <br/>which  they  asserted  were  his  ever  present  companions.  Undoubtedly  the  most  interesting  legend <br/>concerning  Simon  is  that  which  tells  of  his  theosophic  contests  with  the  Apostle  Peter  while  the  two <br/>were  promulgating  their  differing  doctrines  in  Rome.  According  to  the  story  that  the  Church  Fathers <br/>have  preserved,  Simon  was  to  prove  his  spiritual  superiority  by  ascending  to  heaven  in  a  chariot  of <br/>fire.  He  was  actually  picked  up  and  carried  many  feet  into  the  air  by  invisible  powers.  When  St.  Peter <br/>saw  this,  he  cried  out  in  a  loud  voice,  ordering  the  demons  (spirits  of  the  air)  to  release  their  hold <br/>upon  the  magician.  The  evil  spirits,  when  so  ordered  by  the  great  saint,  were  forced  to  obey.  Simon <br/>fell  a  great  distance  and  was  killed,  which  decisively  proved  the  superiority  of  the  Christian  powers. <br/>This  story  is  undoubtedly  manufactured  out  of  whole  cloth,  as  it  is  only  one  out  of  many  accounts <br/>concerning  his  death,  few  of  which  agree.  As  more  and  more  evidence  is  being  amassed  to  the  effect <br/>that  St,  Peter  was  never  in  Rome,  its  last  possible  vestige  of  authenticity  is  rapidly  being  dissipated. <br/><br/>That  Simon  was  a  philosopher  there  is  no  doubt,  for  wherever  his  exact  words  are  preserved  his <br/>synthetic  and  transcending  thoughts  are  beautifully  expressed.  The  principles  of  Gnosticism  are  well <br/>described  in  the  following  verbatim  statement  by  him,  supposed  to  have  been  preserved  by <br/>Hippolytus:  &quot;To  you,  therefore,  I  say  what  I  say,  and  write  what  I  write.  And  the  writing  is  this.  Of  the <br/>universal  vEons  [periods,  planes,  or  cycles  of  creative  and  created  life  in  substance  and  space,  celestial <br/>creatures]  there  are  two  shoots,  without  beginning  or  end,  springing  from  one  Root,  which  is  the <br/>power  invisible,  inapprehensible  silence  [Bythos].  Of  these  shoots  one  is  manifested  from  above, <br/>which  is  the  Great  Power,  the  Universal  Mind  ordering  all  things,  male,  and  the  other,  [is  manifested] <br/>from  below,  the  Great  Thought,  female,  producing  all  things.  Hence  pairing  with  each  other,  they <br/>unite  and  manifest  the  Middle  Distance,  incomprehensible  Air,  without  beginning  or  end.  In  this  is <br/>the  Father  Who  sustains  all  things,  and  nourishes  those  things  which  have  a  beginning  and  end.&quot;  (See <br/>Simon  Magus,  by  G.  R.  S.  Mead.)  By  this  we  are  to  understand  that  manifestation  is  the  result  of  a <br/>positive  and  a  negative  principle,  one  acting  upon  the  other,  and  it  takes  place  in  the  middle  plane,  or <br/>point  of  equilibrium,  called  the  pleroma.  This  pleroma  is  a  peculiar  substance  produced  out  of  the <br/>blending  of  the  spiritual  and  material  aeons.  Out  of  the  pleroma  was  individualized  the  Demiurgus, <br/>the  immortal  mortal,  to  whom  we  are  responsible  for  our  physical  existence  and  the  suffering  we <br/>must  go  through  in  connection  with  it.  In  the  Gnostic  system,  three  pairs  of  opposites,  called  Syzygies, <br/>emanated  from  the  Eternal  One.  These,  with  Himself,  make  the  total  of  seven.  The  six  (three  pairs) <br/><br/><br/>iEons  (living,  divine  principles)  were  described  by  Simon  in  the  Philosophumena  in  the  following <br/>manner:  The  first  two  were  Mind  (Nous)  and  Thought  (Epinoia).  Then  came  Voice  (Phone)  and  its <br/>opposite,  Name  (Onoma),  and  lastly.  Reason  (Logismos)  and  Reflection  (Enthumesis).  From  these <br/>primordial  six,  united  with  the  Eternal  Flame,  came  forth  the  vEons  (Angels)  who  formed  the  lower <br/>worlds  through  the  direction  of  the  Demiurgus.  (See  the  works  of  H.  P.  Blavatsky.)  How  this  first <br/>Gnosticism  of  Simon  Magus  and  Menander,  his  disciple,  was  amplified,  and  frequently  distorted,  by <br/>later  adherents  to  the  cult  must  now  be  considered. <br/><br/>The  School  of  Gnosticism  was  divided  into  two  major  parts,  commonly  called  the  Syrian  Cult  and  the <br/>Alexandrian  Cult.  These  schools  agreed  in  essentials,  but  the  latter  division  was  more  inclined  to  be <br/>pantheistic,  while  the  former  was  dualistic.  While  the  Syrian  cult  was  largely  Simonian,  the <br/>Alexandrian  School  was  the  outgrowth  of  the  philosophical  deductions  of  a  clever  Egyptian  Christian, <br/>Basilides  by  name,  who  claimed  to  have  received  his  instructions  from  the  Apostle  Matthew.  Like <br/>Simon  Magus,  he  was  an  emanationist,  with  Neo-Platonic  inclinations.  In  fact,  the  entire  Gnostic <br/>Mystery  is  based  upon  the  hypothesis  of  emanations  as  being  the  logical  connection  between  the <br/>irreconcilable  opposites  Absolute  Spirit  and  Absolute  Substance,  which  the  Gnostics  believed  to  have <br/>been  coexistent  in  Eternity.  Some  assert  that  Basilides  was  the  true  founder  of  Gnosticism,  but  there <br/>is  much  evidence  to  the  effect  that  Simon  Magus  laid  down  its  fundamental  principles  in  the <br/>preceding  century. <br/><br/>The  Alexandrian  Basilides  inculcated  Egyptian  Hermeticism,  Oriental  occultism,  Chaldean  astrology, <br/>and  Persian  philosophy  in  his  followers,  and  in  his  doctrines  sought  to  unite  the  schools  of  early <br/>Christianity  with  the  ancient  pagan  Mysteries.  To  him  is  attributed  the  formulation  of  that  peculiar <br/>concept  of  the  Deity  which  carries  the  name  of  Abraxas.  In  discussing  the  original  meaning  of  this <br/>word,  Godfrey  Higgins,  in  his  Celtic  Druids,  has  demonstrated  that  the  numerological  powers  of  the <br/>letters  forming  the  word  Abraxas  when  added  together  result  in  the  sum  of  365.  The  same  author  also <br/>notes  that  the  name  Mithras  when  treated  in  a  similar  manner  has  the  same  numerical  value. <br/>Basilides  caught  that  the <br/><br/><br/>THE  DEATH  OF  SIMON  THE  MAGICIAN. <br/><br/><br/>From  the  Nuremberg  Chronicle. <br/><br/><br/>Simon  Magus,  having  called  upon  the  Spirits  of  the  Air,  is  here  shown  being  picked  up  by  the  demons.  St.  Peter  demands <br/>that  the  evil  genii  release  their  hold  upon  the  magician.  The  demons  are  forced  to  comply  and  Simon  Magus  is  killed  by <br/>the  fall. <br/><br/>p.  26 <br/><br/>powers  of  the  universe  were  divided  into  365  ^ons,  or  spiritual  cycles,  and  that  the  sum  of  all  these <br/>together  was  the  Supreme  Father,  and  to  Him  he  gave  the  Qabbalistical  appellation  Abraxas,  as  being <br/>symbolical,  numerologically,  of  His  divine  powers,  attributes,  and  emanations.  Abraxas  is  usually <br/>symbolized  as  a  composite  creature,  with  the  body  of  a  human  being  and  the  head  of  a  rooster,  and <br/>with  each  of  his  legs  ending  in  a  serpent.  C.  W.  King,  in  his  Gnostics  and  Their  Remains,  gives  the <br/>following  concise  description  of  the  Gnostic  philosophy  of  Basilides,  quoting  from  the  writings  of  the <br/>early  Christian  bishop  and  martyr,  St.  Irengeus:  &quot;He  asserted  that  God,  the  uncreated,  eternal  Father, <br/>had  first  brought  forth  Nous,  or  Mind;  this  the  Logos,  Word;  this  again  Phronesis,  Intelligence;  from <br/>Phronesis  sprung  Sophia,  Wisdom,  and  Dynamis,  Strength.&quot; <br/><br/>In  describing  Abraxas,  C.  W.  King  says:  &quot;Bellermann  considers  the  composite  image,  inscribed  with <br/>the  actual  name  Abraxas,  to  be  a  Gnostic  Pantheos,  representing  the  Supreme  Being,  with  the  Five <br/>Emanations  marked  out  by  appropriate  symbols.  From  the  human  body,  the  usual  form  assigned  to <br/>the  Deity,  spring  the  two  supporters,  Nous  and  Logos,  expressed  in  the  serpents,  symbols  of  the  inner <br/>senses,  and  the  quickening  understanding;  on  which  account  the  Greeks  had  made  the  serpent  the <br/>attribute  of  Pallas.  His  head&#x2014;that  of  a  cock&#x2014;represents  Phronesis,  that  bird  being  the  emblem  of <br/>foresight  and  of  vigilance.  His  two  arms  hold  the  symbols  of  Sophia  and  Dynamis:  the  shield  of <br/>Wisdom  and  the  whip  of  Power.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Gnostics  were  divided  in  their  opinions  concerning  the  Demiurgus,  or  creator  of  the  lower  worlds. <br/>He  established  the  terrestrial  universe  with  the  aid  of  six  sons,  or  emanations  (possibly  the  planetary <br/>Angels)  which  He  formed  out  of,  and  yet  within.  Himself.  As  stated  before,  the  Demiurgus  was <br/>individualized  as  the  lowest  creation  out  of  the  substance  called  p/eroma.  One  group  of  the  Gnostics <br/>was  of  the  opinion  that  the  Demiurgus  was  the  cause  of  all  misery  and  was  an  evil  creature,  who  by <br/>building  this  lower  world  had  separated  the  souls  of  men  from  truth  by  encasing  them  in  mortal <br/>vehicles.  The  other  sect  viewed  the  Demiurgus  as  being  divinely  inspired  and  merely  fulfilling  the <br/>dictates  of  the  invisible  Lord.  Some  Gnostics  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  Jewish  God,  Jehovah,  was <br/>the  Demiurgus.  This  concept,  under  a  slightly  different  name,  apparently  influenced  mediaeval <br/>Rosicrucianism,  which  viewed  Jehovah  as  the  Lord  of  the  material  universe  rather  than  as  the <br/>Supreme  Deity.  Mythology  abounds  with  the  stories  of  gods  who  partook  of  both  celestial  and <br/>terrestrial  natures.  Odin,  of  Scandinavia,  is  a  good  example  of  a  deity  subject  to  mortality,  bowing <br/>before  the  laws  of  Nature  and  yet  being,  in  certain  senses  at  least,  a  Supreme  Deity. <br/><br/>The  Gnostic  vieM^oint  concerning  the  Christ  is  well  worthy  of  consideration.  This  order  claimed  to  be <br/>the  only  sect  to  have  actual  pictures  of  the  Divine  Syrian.  While  these  were,  in  all  probability, <br/>idealistic  conceptions  of  the  Savior  based  upon  existing  sculpturings  and  paintings  of  the  pagan  sun <br/>gods,  they  were  all  Christianity  had.  To  the  Gnostics,  the  Christ  was  the  personification  of  Nous,  the <br/>Divine  Mind,  and  emanated  from  the  higher  spiritual  iEons.  He  descended  into  the  body  of  Jesus  at <br/>the  baptism  and  left  it  again  before  the  crucifixion.  The  Gnostics  declared  that  the  Christ  was  not <br/>crucified,  as  this  Divine  Nous  could  not  suffer  death,  but  that  Simon,  the  Cyrenian,  offered  his  life <br/>instead  and  that  the  Nous,  by  means  of  its  power,  caused  Simon  to  resemble  Jesus.  Irenseus  makes <br/>the  following  statement  concerning  the  cosmic  sacrifice  of  the  Christ: <br/><br/>&quot;When  the  uncreated,  unnamed  Father  saw  the  corruption  of  mankind.  He  sent  His  firstborn.  Nous, <br/>into  the  world,  in  the  form  of  Christ,  for  the  redemption  of  all  who  believe  in  Him,  out  of  the  power  of <br/>those  that  have  fabricated  the  world  (the  Demiurgus,  and  his  six  sons,  the  planetary  genii).  He <br/>appeared  amongst  men  as  the  Man  Jesus,  and  wrought  miracles.&quot;  (See  King's  Gnostics  and  Their <br/>Remains.) <br/><br/><br/>The  Gnostics  divided  humanity  into  three  parts:  those  who,  as  savages,  worshiped  only  the  visible <br/><br/>Nature;  those  who,  like  the  Jews,  worshiped  the  Demiurgus;  and  lastly,  themselves,  or  others  of  a <br/>similar  cult,  including  certain  sects  of  Christians,  who  worshiped  Nous  (Christ)  and  the  true  spiritual <br/>light  of  the  higher  vEons. <br/><br/>After  the  death  of  Basilides,  Valentinus  became  the  leading  inspiration  of  the  Gnostic  movement.  He <br/>still  further  complicated  the  system  of  Gnostic  philosophy  by  adding  infinitely  to  the  details.  He <br/>increased  the  number  of  emanations  from  the  Great  One  (the  Abyss)  to  fifteen  pairs  and  also  laid <br/>much  emphasis  on  the  Virgin  Sophia,  or  Wisdom.  In  the  Books  of  the  Savior,  parts  of  which  are <br/>commonly  known  as  the  Pistis  Sophia,  may  be  found  much  material  concerning  this  strange  doctrine <br/>of  i^lons  and  their  strange  inhabitants.  James  Freeman  Clarke,  in  speaking  of  the  doctrines  of  the <br/>Gnostics,  says:  &quot;These  doctrines,  strange  as  they  seem  to  us,  had  a  wide  influence  in  the  Christian <br/>Church.&quot;  Many  of  the  theories  of  the  ancient  Gnostics,  especially  those  concerning  scientific  subjects, <br/>have  been  substantiated  by  modern  research.  Several  sects  branched  off  from  the  main  stem  of <br/>Gnosticism,  such  as  the  Valentinians,  the  Ophites  (serpent  worshipers),  and  the  Adamites.  After  the <br/>third  century  their  power  waned,  and  the  Gnostics  practically  vanished  from  the  philosophic  world. <br/>An  effort  was  made  during  the  Middle  Ages  to  resurrect  the  principles  of  Gnosticism,  but  owing  to  the <br/>destruction  of  their  records  the  material  necessary  was  not  available.  Even  today  there  are  evidences <br/>of  Gnostic  philosophy  in  the  modern  world,  but  they  bear  other  names  and  their  true  origin  is  not <br/>suspected.  Many  of  the  Gnostic  concepts  have  actually  been  incorporated  into  the  dogmas  of  the <br/>Christian  Church,  and  our  newer  interpretations  of  Christianity  are  often  along  the  lines  of  Gnostic <br/>emanationism. <br/><br/><br/>THE  MYSTERIES  OF <br/><br/><br/>ASAR-HAPI <br/><br/><br/>The  identity  of  the  Greco-Egyptian  Serapis  (known  to  the  Greeks  as  Serapis  and  the  Egyptians  as <br/>Asar-Hapi)  is  shrouded  by  an  impenetrable  veil  of  mystery.  While  this  deity  was  a  familiar  figure <br/>among  the  symbols  of  the  secret  Egyptian  initiatory  rites,  his  arcane  nature  was  revealed  only  to  those <br/>who  had  fulfilled  the  requirements  of  the  Serapic  cultus.  Therefore,  in  all  probability,  excepting  the <br/>initiated  priests,  the  Egyptians  themselves  were  ignorant  of  his  true  character.  So  far  as  known,  there <br/>exists  no  authentic  account  of  the  rites  of  Serapis,  but  an  analysis  of  the  deity  and  his  accompanying <br/>symbols  reveals  their  salient  points.  In  an  oracle  delivered  to  the  King  of  Cyprus,  Serapis  described <br/>himself  thus: <br/><br/>&quot;A  god  I  am  such  as  I  show  to  thee. <br/>The  Starry  Heavens  are  my  head,  my  trunk  the  sea. <br/>Earth  forms  my  feet,  mine  ears  the  air  supplies. <br/>The  Sun's  far-darting,  brilliant  rays,  mine  eyes.&quot; <br/><br/>Several  unsatisfactory  attempts  have  been  made  to  etymologize  the  word  Serapis.  Godfrey  Higgins <br/>notes  that  Soros  was  the  name  given  by  the  Egyptians  to  a  stone  coffin,  and  Apis  was  Osiris  incarnate <br/>in  the  sacred  bull.  These  two  words  combined  result  in  Soros-Apis  or  Sor-Apis,  &quot;the  tomb  of  the  bull.&quot; <br/>But  it  is  improbable  that  the  Egyptians  would  worship  a  coffin  in  the  form  of  a  man. <br/><br/>Several  ancient  authors,  including  Macrobius,  have  affirmed  that  Serapis  was  a  name  for  the  Sun, <br/>because  his  image  so  often  had  a  halo  of  light  about  its  head.  In  his  Oration  Upon  the  Sovereign  Sun, <br/>Julian  speaks  of  the  deity  in  these  words:  &quot;One  Jove,  one  Pluto,  one  Sun  is  Serapis.&quot;  In  Hebrew, <br/>Serapis  is  Saraph,  meaning  &quot;to  blaze  out&quot;  or  &quot;to  blaze  up.&quot;  For  this  reason  the  Jews  designated  one  of <br/>their  hierarchies  of  spiritual  beings.  Seraphim. <br/><br/><br/>The  most  common  theory,  however,  regarding  the  origin  of  the  name  Serapis  is  that  which  traces  its <br/><br/>derivation  from  the  compound  Osiris-Apis.  At  one  time  the  Egyptians  believed  that  the  dead  were <br/>absorbed  into  the  nature  of  Osiris,  the  god  of  the  dead.  While  marked  similarity  exists  between  Osiris- <br/>Apis  and  Serapis,  the  theory  advanced  by  Egyptologists  that  Serapis  is  merely  a  name  given  to  the <br/>dead  Apis,  or  sacred  bull  of  Egypt,  is  untenable  in  view  of  the  transcendent  wisdom  possessed  by  the <br/>Egyptian  priestcraft,  who,  in  all  probability,  used  the  god  to  symbolize  the  soul  of  the  world  {anima <br/>mundi).  The  material  body  of  Nature  was  called  Apzs;  the  soul  which  escaped  from  the  body  at  death <br/>but  was  enmeshed  with  the  form  during  physical  life  was  designated  Serapis. <br/><br/>C.  W.  King  believes  Serapis  to  be  a  deity  of  Brahmanic  extraction,  his  name  being  the  Grecianized <br/>form  of  Ser-adah  or  Sri-pa,  two  titles  ascribed  to  Yama,  the  Hindu  god  of  death.  This  appears <br/>reasonable,  especially  since  there  is  a  legend  to  the  effect  that  Serapis,  in  the  form  of  a  bull,  was <br/>driven  by  Bacchus  from  India  to  Egypt.  The  priority  of  the  Hindu  Mysteries  would  further <br/>substantiate  such  a  theory. <br/><br/>Among  other  meanings  suggested  for  the  word  Serapis  are:  &quot;The  Sacred  Bull,&quot;  &quot;The  Sun  in  Taurus,&quot; <br/>&quot;The  Soul  of  Osiris,&quot;  &quot;The  Sacred  Serpent,&quot;  and  &quot;The  Retiring  of  the  Bull.&quot;  The  last  appellation  has <br/>reference  to  the  ceremony  of  drowning  the  sacred  Apis  in  the  waters  of  the  Nile  every  twenty-five <br/>years. <br/><br/><br/>This  Gnostic  gem  represents  by  its  serpentine  body  the  pathway  of  the  Sun  and  by  its  Hon  head  the  exaltation  of  the  solar <br/>in  the  constellation  of  Leo. <br/><br/><br/>THE  LION-FACED  LIGHT-POWER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon 's  Antiquities. <br/><br/><br/>A  SYMBOLIC  LABYRINTH. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon 's  Antiquities. <br/><br/><br/>Labyrinths  and  mazes  were  favored  places  of  initiation  among  many  ancient  cults.  Remains  of  these  mystic  mazes  have <br/>been  found  among  the  American  Indians,  Hindus,  Persians,  Egyptians,  and  Greeks.  Some  of  these  mazes  are  merely <br/>involved  pathways  lined  with  stones;  others  are  literally  miles  of  gloomy  caverns  under  temples  or  hollowed  from  the <br/>sides  of  mountains.  The  famous  labyrinth  of  Crete,  in  which  roamed  the  bull-headed  Minotaur,  was  unquestionably  a <br/>place  of  initiation  into  the  Cretan  Mysteries. <br/><br/>p.  27 <br/><br/>There  is  considerable  evidence  that  the  famous  statue  of  Serapis  in  the  Serapeum  at  Alexandria  was <br/>originally  worshiped  under  another  name  at  Sinope,  from  which  it  was  brought  to  Alexandria.  There <br/>is  also  a  legend  which  tells  that  Serapis  was  a  very  early  king  of  the  Egyptians,  to  whom  they  owed  the <br/>foundation  of  their  philosophical  and  scientific  power.  After  his  death  this  king  was  elevated  to  the <br/>estate  of  a  god.  Phylarchus  declared  that  the  word  Serapis  means  &quot;the  power  that  disposed  the <br/>universe  into  its  present  beautiful  order.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  Isis  and  Osiris,  Plutarch  gives  the  following  account  of  the  origin  of  the  magnificent  statue  of <br/>Serapis  which  stood  in  the  Serapeum  at  Alexandria: <br/><br/>While  he  was  Pharaoh  of  Egypt,  Ptolemy  Soter  had  a  strange  dream  in  which  he  beheld  a  tremendous <br/>statue,  which  came  to  life  and  ordered  the  Pharaoh  to  bring  it  to  Alexandria  with  all  possible  speed. <br/>Ptolemy  Soter,  not  knowing  the  whereabouts  of  the  statue,  was  sorely  perplexed  as  to  how  he  could <br/>discover  it.  While  the  Pharaoh  was  relating  his  dream,  a  great  traveler  by  the  name  of  Sosibius, <br/>coming  forward,  declared  that  he  had  seen  such  an  image  at  Sinope.  The  Pharaoh  immediately <br/>dispatched  Soteles  and  Dionysius  to  negotiate  for  the  removal  of  the  figure  to  Alexandria.  Three  years <br/>elapsed  before  the  image  was  finally  obtained,  the  representatives  of  the  Pharaoh  finally  stealing  it <br/>and  concealing  the  theft  by  spreading  a  story  that  the  statue  had  come  to  life  and,  walking  down  the <br/>street  leading  from  its  temple,  had  boarded  the  ship  prepared  for  its  transportation  to  Alexandria. <br/>Upon  its  arrival  in  Egypt,  the  figure  was  brought  into  the  presence  of  two  Egyptian  Initiates&#x2014;the <br/>Eumolpid  Timotheus  and  Manetho  the  Sebennite~who,  immediately  pronounced  it  to  be  Serapis. <br/>The  priests  then  declared  that  it  was  equipollent  to  Pluto.  This  was  a  masterly  stroke,  for  in  Serapis <br/>the  Greeks  and  Egyptians  found  a  deity  in  common  and  thus  religious  unity  was  consummated <br/>between  the  two  nations. <br/><br/>Several  figures  of  Serapis  that  stood  in  his  various  temples  in  Egypt  and  Rome  have  been  described  by <br/>early  authors.  Nearly  all  these  showed  Grecian  rather  than  Egyptian  influence.  In  some  the  body  of <br/>the  god  was  encircled  by  the  coils  of  a  great  serpent.  Others  showed  him  as  a  composite  of  Osiris  and <br/>Apis. <br/><br/>A  description  of  the  god  that  in  all  probability  is  reasonably  accurate  is  that  which  represents  him  as  a <br/>tall,  powerful  figure,  conveying  the  twofold  impression  of  manly  strength  and  womanly  grace.  His <br/>face  portrayed  a  deeply  pensive  mood,  the  expression  inclining  toward  sadness.  His  hair  was  long  and <br/>arranged  in  a  somewhat  feminine  manner,  resting  in  curls  upon  his  breast  and  shoulders.  The  face, <br/>save  for  its  heavy  beard,  was  also  decidedly  feminine.  The  figure  of  Serapis  was  usually  robed  from <br/>head  to  foot  in  heavy  draperies,  believed  by  initiates  to  conceal  the  fact  that  his  body  was <br/>androgynous. <br/><br/>Various  substances  were  used  in  making  the  statues  of  Serapis.  Some  undoubtedly  were  carved  from <br/>stone  or  marble  by  skilled  craftsmen;  others  may  have  been  cast  from  base  or  precious  metals.  One <br/>colossus  of  Serapis  was  composed  of  plates  of  various  metals  fitted  together.  In  a  labyrinth  sacred  to <br/>Serapis  stood  a  thirteen-foot  statue  of  him  reputed  to  have  been  made  from  a  single  emerald.  Modern <br/>writers,  discussing  this  image,  state  that  it  was  made  of  green  glass  poured  into  a  mold.  According  to <br/>the  Egyptians,  however,  it  withstood  all  the  tests  of  an  actual  emerald. <br/><br/><br/>Clement  of  Alexandria  describes  a  figure  of  Serapis  compounded  from  the  following  elements:  First, <br/>filings  of  gold,  silver,  lead,  and  tin;  second,  all  manner  of  Egyptian  stones,  including  sapphires, <br/>hematites,  emeralds,  and  topazes;  all  these  being  ground  down  and  mixed  together  with  the  coloring <br/>matter  left  over  from  the  funeral  of  Osiris  and  Apis.  The  result  was  a  rare  and  curious  figure,  indigo  in <br/>color.  Some  of  the  statues  of  Serapis  must  have  been  formed  of  extremely  hard  substances,  for  when  a <br/>Christian  soldier,  carrying  out  the  edict  of  Theodosius,  struck  the  Alexandrian  Serapis  with  his  ax, <br/>that  instrument  was  shattered  into  fragments  and  sparks  flew  from  it.  It  is  also  quite  probable  that <br/>Serapis  was  worshiped  in  the  form  of  a  serpent,  in  common  with  many  of  the  higher  deities  of  the <br/>Egyptian  and  Greek  pantheons. <br/><br/>Serapis  was  called  Theon  Heptagrammaton,  or  the  god  with  the  name  of  seven  letters.  The  name <br/>Serapis  (like  Abraxas  and  Mithras)  contains  seven  letters.  In  their  hymns  to  Serapis  the  priests <br/>chanted  the  seven  vowels.  Occasionally  Serapis  is  depicted  with  horns  or  a  coronet  of  seven  rays. <br/>These  evidently  represented  the  seven  divine  intelligences  manifesting  through  the  solar  light.  The <br/>Encyclopgedia  Britannica  notes  that  the  earliest  authentic  mention  of  Serapis  is  in  connection  with <br/>the  death  of  Alexander.  Such  was  the  prestige  of  Serapis  that  he  alone  of  the  gods  was  consulted  in <br/>behalf  of  the  dying  king. <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  secret  school  of  philosophy  was  divided  into  the  Lesser  and  the  Greater  Mysteries,  the <br/>former  being  sacred  to  Isis  and  the  latter  to  Serapis  and  Osiris.  Wilkinson  is  of  the  opinion  that  only <br/>the  priests  were  permitted  to  enter  the  Greater  Mysteries.  Even  the  heir  to  the  throne  was  not  eligible <br/>until  he  had  been  crowned  Pharaoh,  when,  by  virtue  of  his  kingly  office,  he  automatically  became  a <br/>priest  and  the  temporal  head  of  the  state  religion.  (See  Wilkinson's  Manners  and  Customs  of  the <br/>Egyptians.)  A  limited  number  were  admitted  into  the  Greater  Mysteries:  these  preserved  their  secrets <br/>inviolate. <br/><br/>Much  of  the  information  concerning  the  rituals  of  the  higher  degrees  of  the  Egyptian  Mysteries  has <br/>been  gleaned  from  an  examination  of  the  chambers  and  passageways  in  which  the  initiations  were <br/>given.  Under  the  temple  of  Serapis  destroyed  by  Theodosius  were  found  strange  mechanical <br/>contrivances  constructed  by  the  priests  in  the  subterranean  crypts  and  caverns  where  the  nocturnal <br/>initiatory  rites  were  celebrated.  These  machines  indicate  the  severe  tests  of  moral  and  physical <br/>courage  undergone  by  the  candidates.  After  passing  through  these  tortuous  ways,  the  neophytes  who <br/>Survived  the  ordeals  were  ushered  into  the  presence  of  Serapis,  a  noble  and  awe-inspiring  figure <br/>illumined  by  unseen  lights. <br/><br/>Labyrinths  were  also  a  striking  feature  in  connection  with  the  Rice  of  Serapis,  and  E.  A.  Wallis  Budge, <br/>in  his  Gods  of  the  Egyptians,  depicts  Serapis(Minotaur-like)  with  the  body  of  a  man  and  the  head  of  a <br/>bull.  Labyrinths  were  symbolic  of  the  involvements  and  illusions  of  the  lower  world  through  which <br/>wanders  the  soul  of  man  in  its  search  for  truth.  In  the  labyrinth  dwells  the  lower  animal  man  with  the <br/>head  of  the  bull,  who  seeks  to  destroy  the  soul  entangled  in  the  maze  of  worldly  ignorance.  In  this <br/>relation  Serapis  becomes  the  Tryer  or  Adversary  who  tests  the  souls  of  those  seeking  union  with  the <br/>Immortals.  The  maze  was  also  doubtless  used  to  represent  the  solar  system,  the  Bull-Man <br/>representing  the  sun  dwelling  in  the  mystic  maze  of  its  planets,  moons,  and  asteroids. <br/><br/>The  Gnostic  Mysteries  were  acquainted  with  the  arcane  meaning  of  Serapis,  and  through  the  medium <br/>of  Gnosticism  this  god  became  inextricably  associated  with  early  Christianity.  In  fact,  the  Emperor <br/>Hadrian,  while  traveling  in  Egypt  in  A.D.  24,  declared  in  a  letter  to  Servianus  that  the  worshipers  of <br/>Serapis  were  Christians  and  that  the  Bishops  of  the  church  also  worshiped  at  his  shrine.  He  even <br/>declared  that  the  Patriarch  himself,  when  in  Egypt,  was  forced  to  adore  Serapis  as  well  as  Christ.  (See <br/>Parsons'  New  Light  on  the  Great  Pyramid.) <br/><br/>The  little-suspected  importance  of  Serapis  as  a  prototype  of  Christ  can  be  best  appreciated  after  a <br/>consideration  of  the  following  extract  from  C.  W.  King's  Gnostics  and  Their  Remains:  &quot;There  can  be <br/><br/><br/>no  doubt  that  the  head  of  Serapis,  marked  as  the  face  is  by  a  grave  and  pensive  majesty,  suppHed  the <br/>first  idea  for  the  conventional  portraits  of  the  Saviour.  The  Jewish  prejudices  of  the  first  converts <br/>were  so  powerful  that  we  may  be  sure  no  attempt  was  made  to  depict  His  countenance  until  some <br/>generations  after  all  that  had  beheld  it  on  earth  had  passed  away.&quot; <br/><br/>Serapis  gradually  usurped  the  positions  previously  occupied  by  the  other  Egyptian  and  Greek  gods, <br/>and  became  the  supreme  deity  of  both  religions.  His  power  continued  until  the  fourth  century  of <br/><br/><br/>THE  ALEXANDRIAN  SERAPIS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Mosaize  Historie  der  Hebreeuwse  Kerke. <br/><br/>Serapis  is  often  shown  standing  on  the  back  of  the  sacred  crocodile,  carrying  in  his  left  hand  a  rule  with  which  to  measure <br/>the  inundations  of  the  Nile,  and  balancing  with  his  right  hand  a  curious  emblem  consisting  of  an  animal  with  the  heads. <br/>The  first  head&#x2014;that  of  a  lion&#x2014;signified  the  present;  the  second  head&#x2014; that  of  a  wolf&#x2014; the  past;  and  the  third  head&#x2014; that  of  a <br/>dog&#x2014; the  future.  The  body  with  its  three  heads  was  enveloped  by  the  twisted  coils  of  a  serpent.  Figures  of  Serapis  are <br/>occasionally  accompanied  by  Cerberus,  the  three-headed  dog  of  Pluto,  and&#x2014; like  Jupiter&#x2014; carry  baskets  of  grain  upon  their <br/>heads. <br/><br/>p.  28 <br/><br/>the  Christian  Era.  In  A.D.  385,  Theodosius,  that  would-be  exterminator  of  pagan  philosophy,  issued <br/>his  memorable  edict  De  Idolo  Serapidis  Diruendo.  When  the  Christian  soldiers,  in  obedience  to  this <br/>order,  entered  the  Serapeum  at  Alexandria  to  destroy  the  image  of  Serapis  which  had  stood  there  for <br/>centuries,  so  great  was  their  veneration  for  the  god  that  they  dared  not  touch  the  image  lest  the <br/>ground  should  open  at  their  feet  and  engulf  them.  At  length,  overcoming  their  fear,  they  demolished <br/>the  statue,  sacked  the  building,  and  finally  as  a  fitting  climax  to  their  offense  burned  the  magnificent <br/>library  which  was  housed  within  the  lofty  apartments  of  the  Serapeum.  Several  writers  have  recorded <br/>the  remarkable  fact  that  Christian  symbols  were  found  in  the  ruined  foundations  of  this  pagan  temple <br/>Socrates,  a  church  historian  of  the  fifth  century,  declared  that  after  the  pious  Christians  had  razed  the <br/>Serapeum  at  Alexandria  and  scattered  the  demons  who  dwelt  there  under  the  guise  of  gods,  beneath <br/>the  foundations  was  found  the  monogram  of  Christ! <br/><br/><br/>Two  quotations  will  further  establish  the  relationship  existing  between  the  Mysteries  of  Serapis  and <br/>those  of  other  ancient  peoples.  The  first  is  from  Richard  Payne  Knight's  Symbolical  Language  of <br/>Ancient  Art  and  Mythology:  &quot;Hence  Varro  [in  De  Lingua  Latina]  says  that  Coelum  and  Terra,  that  is <br/>universal  mind  and  productive  body,  were  the  Great  Gods  of  the  Samothracian  Mysteries;  and  the <br/>same  as  the  Serapis  and  Isis  of  the  later  ^Egyptians:  the  Taautos  and  Astarte  of  the  Phcenicians,  and <br/>the  Saturn  and  Ops  of  the  Latins.&quot;  The  second  quotation  is  from  Albert  Pike's  Morals  and  Dogma: <br/>&quot;'Thee,'  says  Martianus  Capella,  in  his  hymn  to  the  Sun,  'dwellers  on  the  Nile  adore  as  Serapis,  and <br/>Memphis  worships  as  Osiris:  in  the  sacred  rites  of  Persia  thou  art  Mithras,  in  Phrygia,  Atys,  and  Libya <br/>bows  down  to  thee  as  Ammon,  and  Phoenician  Byblos  as  Adonis;  thus  the  whole  world  adores  thee <br/>under  different  names.'&quot; <br/><br/>THE  ODINIC  MYSTERIES <br/><br/>The  date  of  the  founding  of  the  Odinic  Mysteries  is  uncertain,  some  writers  declaring  that  they  were <br/>established  in  the  first  century  before  Christ;  others,  the  first  century  after  Christ.  Robert  Macoy,  33&#x00b0;, <br/>gives  the  following  description  of  their  origin:  &quot;It  appears  from  the  northern  chronicles  that  in  the <br/>first  century  of  the  Christian  Era,  Sigge,  the  chief  of  the  Aser,  an  Asiatic  tribe,  emigrated  from  the <br/>Caspian  sea  and  the  Caucasus  into  northern  Europe.  He  directed  his  course  northwesterly  from  the <br/>Black  sea  to  Russia,  over  which,  according  to  tradition,  he  placed  one  of  his  sons  as  a  ruler,  as  he  is <br/>said  to  have  done  over  the  Saxons  and  the  Franks.  He  then  advanced  through  Cimbria  to  Denmark, <br/>which  acknowledged  his  fifth  son  Skiold  as  its  sovereign,  and  passed  over  to  Sweden,  where  Gylf,  who <br/>did  homage  to  the  wonderful  stranger,  and  was  initiated  into  his  mysteries,  then  ruled.  He  soon  made <br/>himself  master  here,  built  Sigtuna  as  the  capital  of  his  empire,  and  promulgated  a  new  code  of  laws, <br/>and  established  the  sacred  mysteries.  He,  himself,  assumed  the  name  of  Odin,  founded  the  priesthood <br/>of  the  twelve  Drottars  (Druids?)  who  conducted  the  secret  worship,  and  the  administration  of  justice, <br/>and,  as  prophets,  revealed  the  future.  The  secret  rites  of  these  mysteries  celebrated  the  death  of <br/>Balder,  the  beautiful  and  lovely,  and  represented  the  grief  of  Gods  and  men  at  his  death,  and  his <br/>restoration  to  life.&quot;  {General  History  of  Freemasonry.) <br/><br/>After  his  death,  the  historical  Odin  was  apotheosized,  his  identity  being  merged  into  that  of  the <br/>mjrthological  Odin,  god  of  wisdom,  whose  cult  he  had  promulgated.  Odinism  then  supplanted  the <br/>worship  of  Thor,  the  thunderer,  the  supreme  deity  of  the  ancient  Scandinavian  pantheon.  The  mound <br/>where,  according  to  legend,  King  Odin  was  buried  is  still  to  be  seen  near  the  site  of  his  great  temple  at <br/>Upsala. <br/><br/>The  twelve  Drottars  who  presided  over  the  Odinic  Mysteries  evidently  personified  the  twelve  holy <br/>and  ineffable  names  of  Odin.  The  rituals  of  the  Odinic  Mysteries  were  very  similar  to  those  of  the <br/>Greeks,  Persians,  and  Brahmins,  after  which  they  were  patterned.  The  Drottars,  who  symbolized  the <br/>signs  of  the  zodiac,  were  the  custodians  of  the  arts  and  sciences,  which  they  revealed  to  those  who <br/>passed  successfully  the  ordeals  of  initiation.  Like  many  other  pagan  cults,  the  Odinic  Mysteries,  as  an <br/>institution,  were  destroyed  by  Christianity,  but  the  underlying  cause  of  their  fall  was  the  corruption  of <br/>the  priesthood. <br/><br/>Mythology  is  nearly  always  the  ritual  and  the  symbolism  of  a  Mystery  school.  Briefly  stated,  the <br/>sacred  drama  which  formed  the  basis  of  the  Odinic  Mysteries  was  as  follows: <br/><br/>The  Supreme,  invisible  Creator  of  all  things  was  called  All-Father.  His  regent  in  Nature  was  Odin,  the <br/>one-eyed  god.  Like  Quetzalcoatl,  Odin  was  elevated  to  the  dignity  of  the  Supreme  Deity.  According  to <br/>the  Drottars,  the  universe  was  fashioned  from  the  body  of  Ymir,  the  hoarfrost  giant.  Ymir  was  formed <br/>from  the  clouds  of  mist  that  rose  from  Ginnungagap,  the  great  cleft  in  chaos  into  which  the <br/>primordial  frost  giants  and  flame  giants  had  hurled  snow  and  fire.  The  three  gods&#x2014;Odin,  Vili,  and  Ve- <br/>-slew  Ymir  and  from  him  formed  the  world.  From  Ymir's  various  members  the  different  parts  of <br/>Nature  were  fashioned. <br/><br/><br/>After  Odin  had  established  order,  he  caused  a  wonderful  palace,  called  Asgard,  to  be  built  on  the  top <br/><br/>of  a  mountain,  and  here  the  twelve  ^^Isir  (gods)  dwelt  together,  far  above  the  limitations  of  mortal <br/>men.  On  this  mountain  also  was  Valhalla,  the  palace  of  the  slain,  where  those  who  had  heroically  died <br/>fought  and  feasted  day  after  day.  Each  night  their  wounds  were  healed  and  the  boar  whose  flesh  they <br/>ate  renewed  itself  as  rapidly  as  it  was  consumed. <br/><br/>Balder  the  Beautiful&#x2014;the  Scandinavian  Christ &#x2014;was  the  beloved  son  of  Odin.  Balder  was  not  warlike; <br/>his  kindly  and  beautiful  spirit  brought  peace  and  joy  to  the  hearts  of  the  gods,  and  they  all  loved  him <br/>save  one.  As  Jesus  had  a  Judas  among  His  twelve  disciples,  so  one  of  the  twelve  gods  was  false&#x2014;Loki, <br/>the  personification  of  evil.  Loki  caused  Hothr,  the  blind  god  of  fate,  to  shoot  Balder  with  a  mistletoe <br/>arrow.  With  the  death  of  Balder,  light  and  joy  vanished  from  the  lives  of  the  other  deities. <br/>Heartbroken,  the  gods  gathered  to  find  a  method  whereby  they  could  resurrect  this  spirit  of  eternal <br/>life  and  youth.  The  result  was  the  establishment  of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>The  Odinic  Mysteries  were  given  in  underground  crypts  or  caves,  the  chambers,  nine  in  number, <br/>representing  the  Nine  Worlds  of  the  Mysteries.  The  candidate  seeking  admission  was  assigned  the <br/>task  of  raising  Balder  from  the  dead.  Although  he  did  not  realize  it,  he  himself  played  the  part  of <br/>Balder.  He  called  himself  a  wanderer;  the  caverns  through  which  he  passed  were  symbolic  of  the <br/>worlds  and  spheres  of  Nature.  The  priests  who  initiated  him  were  emblematic  of  the  sun,  the  moon, <br/>and  the  stars.  The  three  supreme  initiators&#x2014;the  Sublime,  the  Equal  to  the  Sublime,  and  the  Highest&#x2014; <br/>were  analogous  to  the  Worshipful  Master  and  the  junior  and  Senior  Wardens  of  a  Masonic  lodge. <br/><br/>After  wandering  for  hours  through  the  intricate  passageways,  the  candidate  was  ushered  into  the <br/>presence  of  a  statue  of  Balder  the  Beautiful,  the  prototype  of  all  initiates  into  the  Mysteries.  This <br/>figure  stood  in  the  center  of  a  great  apartment  roofed  with  shields.  In  the  midst  of  the  chamber  stood <br/>a  plant  with  seven  blossoms,  emblematic  of  the  planers.  In  this  room,  which  symbolized  the  house  of <br/>the  i^sir,  or  Wisdom,  the  neophyte  took  his  oath  of  secrecy  and  piety  upon  the  naked  blade  of  a  sword. <br/>He  drank  the  sanctified  mead  from  a  bowl  made  of  a  human  skull  and,  having  passed  successfully <br/>through  all  the  tortures  and  trials  designed  to  divert  him  from  the  course  of  wisdom,  he  was  finally <br/>permitted  to  unveil  the  mystery  of  Odin&#x2014;the  personification  of  wisdom.  He  was  presented,  in  the <br/>name  of  Balder,  with  the  sacred  ring  of  the  order;  he  was  hailed  as  a  man  reborn;  and  it  was  said  of <br/>him  that  he  had  died  and  had  been  raised  again  without  passing  through  the  gates  of  death. <br/><br/>Richard  Wagner's  immortal  composition,  Der  Ring  des  Nibelungen,  is  based  upon  the  Mystery  rituals <br/>of  the  Odinic  cult.  While  the  great  composer  took  many  liberties  with  the  original  story,  the  Ring <br/>Operas,  declared  to  be  the  grandest  tetralogy  of  music  dramas  the  world  possesses,  have  caught  and <br/>preserved  in  a  remarkable  manner  the  majesty  and  power  of  the  original  sagas.  Beginning  with  Das <br/>Rheingold,  the  action  proceeds  through  Die  Walkilre  and  Siegfried  to  an  awe-inspiring  climax  in <br/>Gdtterddmmerung,  &quot;The  Twilight  of  the  Gods.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  NINE  WORLDS  OF  THE  ODINIC  MYSTERIES. <br/><br/><br/>The  Nordic  Mysteries  were  given  in  nine  chambers,  or  caverns,  the  candidate  advancing  through  them  in  sequential  order. <br/>These  chambers  of  initiation  represented  the  nine  spheres  into  which  the  Drottars  divided  the  universe:  (i)  Asgard,  the <br/>Heaven  World  of  the  Gods;  (2)  Alf-heim,  the  World  of  the  light  and  beautiful  Elves,  or  Spirits;  (3)  Nifl-heim,  the  World  of <br/>Cold  and  Darkness,  which  is  located  in  the  North;  (4)  Jotun-heim,  the  World  of  the  Giants,  which  is  located  in  the  East;  (5) <br/>Midgard,  the  Earth  World  of  human  beings,  which  is  located  in  the  midst,  or  middle  place;  (6)  Vana-heim,  the  World  of <br/>the  Vanes,  which  is  located  in  the  West;  (7)  Muspells-heim,  the  World  of  Fire,  which  is  located  in  the  South;  8)  Svart-alfa- <br/>heim,  the  World  of  the  dark  and  treacherous  Elves,  which  is  under  the  earth;  and  (9)  Hel-heim,  the  World  of  cold  and  the <br/>abode  of  the  dead,  which  is  located  at  the  very  lowest  point  of  the  universe.  It  is  to  be  understood  that  all  of  these  worlds <br/>are  invisible  to  the  senses,  except  Midgard,  the  home  of  human  creatures,  but  during  the  process  of  initiation  the  soul  of <br/>the  candidate&#x2014;liberated  from  its  earthly  sheath  by  the  secret  power  of  the  priests&#x2014;wanders  amidst  the  inhabitants  of <br/>these  various  spheres.  There  is  undoubtedly  a  relationship  between  the  nine  worlds  of  the  Scandinavians  and  the  nine <br/>spheres,  or  planes,  through  which  initiates  of  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  passed  in  their  ritual  of  regeneration. <br/><br/><br/>p.  29 <br/><br/><br/>The  Ancient  Mysteries  and  Secret  Societies <br/><br/>Part  Three <br/><br/>THE  most  famous  of  the  ancient  religious  Mysteries  were  the  Eleusinian,  whose  rites  were  celebrated <br/>every  five  years  in  the  city  of  Eleusis  to  honor  Ceres  (Demeter,  Rhea,  or  Isis)  and  her  daughter, <br/>Persephone.  The  initiates  of  the  Eleusinian  School  were  famous  throughout  Greece  for  the  beauty  of <br/>their  philosophic  concepts  and  the  high  standards  of  morality  which  they  demonstrated  in  their  daily <br/>lives.  Because  of  their  excellence,  these  Mysteries  spread  to  Rome  and  Britain,  and  later  the <br/>initiations  were  given  in  both  these  countries.  The  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  named  for  the  community  in <br/>Attica  where  the  sacred  dramas  were  first  presented,  are  generally  believed  to  have  been  founded  by <br/>Eumolpos  about  fourteen  hundred  years  before  the  birth  of  Christ,  and  through  the  Platonic  system <br/>of  philosophy  their  principles  have  been  preserved  to  modern  times. <br/><br/>The  rites  of  Eleusis,  with  their  Mystic  interpretations  of  Nature's  most  precious  secrets, <br/>overshadowed  the  civilizations  of  their  time  and  gradually  absorbed  many  smaller  schools, <br/>incorporating  into  their  own  system  whatever  valuable  information  these  lesser  institutions  possessed. <br/>Heckethorn  sees  in  the  Mysteries  of  Ceres  and  Bacchus  a  metamorphosis  of  the  rites  of  Isis  and  Osiris, <br/>and  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  all  so-called  secret  schools  of  the  ancient  world  were <br/>branches  from  one  philosophic  tree  which,  with  its  root  in  heaven  and  its  branches  on  the  earth,  is~ <br/>like  the  spirit  of  man&#x2014;an  invisible  but  ever-present  cause  of  the  objectified  vehicles  that  give  it <br/>expression.  The  Mysteries  were  the  channels  through  which  this  one  philosophic  light  was <br/>disseminated,  and  their  initiates,  resplendent  with  intellectual  and  spiritual  understanding,  were  the <br/>perfect  fruitage  of  the  divine  tree,  bearing  witness  before  the  material  world  of  the  recondite  source  of <br/>all  Light  and  Truth. <br/><br/>The  rites  of  Eleusis  were  divided  into  what  were  called  the  Lesser  and  the  Greater  Mysteries. <br/>According  to  James  Gardner,  the  Lesser  Mysteries  were  celebrated  in  the  spring  (probably  at  the  time <br/>of  the  vernal  equinox)  in  the  town  of  Agrse,  and  the  Greater,  in  the  fall  (the  time  of  the  autumnal <br/>equinox)  at  Eleusis  or  Athens.  It  is  supposed  that  the  former  were  given  annually  and  the  latter  every <br/>five  years.  The  rituals  of  the  Eleusinians  were  highly  involved,  and  to  understand  them  required  a <br/>deep  study  of  Greek  mythology,  which  they  interpreted  in  its  esoteric  light  with  the  aid  of  their  secret <br/>keys. <br/><br/>The  Lesser  Mysteries  were  dedicated  to  Persephone.  In  his  Eleusinian  and  Bacchic  Mysteries, <br/>Thomas  Taylor  sums  up  their  purpose  as  follows:  &quot;The  Lesser  Mysteries  were  designed  by  the  ancient <br/>theologists,  their  founders,  to  signify  occultly  the  condition  of  the  unpurified  soul  invested  with  an <br/>earthy  body,  and  enveloped  in  a  material  and  physical  nature.&quot; <br/><br/>The  legend  used  in  the  Lesser  rites  is  that  of  the  abduction  of  the  goddess  Persephone,  the  daughter  of <br/>Ceres,  by  Pluto,  the  lord  of  the  underworld,  or  Hades.  While  Persephone  is  picking  flowers  in  a <br/>beautiful  meadow,  the  earth  suddenly  opens  and  the  gloomy  lord  of  death,  riding  in  a  magnificent <br/>chariot,  emerges  from  its  somber  depths  and,  grasping  her  in  his  arms,  carries  the  screaming  and <br/>struggling  goddess  to  his  subterranean  palace,  where  he  forces  her  to  become  his  queen. <br/><br/>It  is  doubtful  whether  many  of  the  initiates  themselves  understood  the  mystic  meaning  of  this <br/>allegory,  for  most  of  them  apparently  believed  that  it  referred  solely  to  the  succession  of  the  seasons. <br/>It  is  difficult  to  obtain  satisfactory  information  concerning  the  Mysteries,  for  the  candidates  were <br/>bound  by  inviolable  oaths  never  to  reveal  their  inner  secrets  to  the  profane.  At  the  beginning  of  the <br/>ceremony  of  initiation,  the  candidate  stood  upon  the  skins  of  animals  sacrificed  for  the  purpose,  and <br/><br/><br/>vowed  that  death  should  seal  his  lips  before  he  would  divulge  the  sacred  truths  which  were  about  to <br/>be  communicated  to  him.  Through  indirect  channels,  however,  some  of  their  secrets  have  been <br/>preserved.  The  teachings  given  to  the  neophytes  were  substantially  as  follows: <br/><br/>The  soul  of  man&#x2014;often  called  Psyche,  and  in  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  symbolized  by  Persephone~is <br/>essentially  a  spiritual  thing.  Its  true  home  is  in  the  higher  worlds,  where,  free  from  the  bondage  of <br/>material  form  and  material  concepts,  it  is  said  to  be  truly  alive  and  self-expressive.  The  human,  or <br/>physical,  nature  of  man,  according  to  this  doctrine,  is  a  tomb,  a  quagmire,  a  false  and  impermanent <br/>thing,  the  source  of  all  sorrow  and  suffering.  Plato  describes  the  body  as  the  sepulcher  of  the  soul;  and <br/>by  this  he  means  not  only  the  human  form  but  also  the  human  nature. <br/><br/>The  gloom  and  depression  of  the  Lesser  Mysteries  represented  the  agony  of  the  spiritual  soul  unable <br/>to  express  itself  because  it  has  accepted  the  limitations  and  illusions  of  the  human  environment.  The <br/>crux  of  the  Eleusinian  argument  was  that  man  is  neither  better  nor  wiser  after  death  than  during  life. <br/>If  he  does  not  rise  above  ignorance  during  his  sojourn  here,  man  goes  at  death  into  eternity  to  wander <br/>about  forever,  making  the  same  mistakes  which  he  made  here.  If  he  does  not  outgrow  the  desire  for <br/>material  possessions  here,  he  will  carry  it  with  him  into  the  invisible  world,  where,  because  he  can <br/>never  gratify  the  desire,  he  will  continue  in  endless  agony.  Dante's  Inferno  is  symbolically  descriptive <br/>of  the  sufferings  of  those  who  never  freed  their  spiritual  natures  from  the  cravings,  habits,  viewpoints, <br/>and  limitations  of  their  Plutonic  personalities.  Those  who  made  no  endeavor  to  improve  themselves <br/>(whose  souls  have  slept)  during  their  physical  lives,  passed  at  death  into  Hades,  where,  lying  in  rows, <br/>they  slept  through  all  eternity  as  they  had  slept  through  life. <br/><br/>To  the  Eleusinian  philosophers,  birch  into  the  physical  world  was  death  in  the  fullest  sense  of  the <br/>word,  and  the  only  true  birth  was  that  of  the  spiritual  soul  of  man  rising  out  of  the  womb  of  his  own <br/>fleshly  nature.  &quot;The  soul  is  dead  that  slumbers,&quot;  says  Longfellow,  and  in  this  he  strikes  the  keynote  of <br/>the  Eleusinian  Mysteries.  Just  as  Narcissus,  gazing  at  himself  in  the  water  (the  ancients  used  this <br/>mobile  element  to  symbolize  the  transitory,  illusionary,  material  universe)  lost  his  life  trying  to <br/>embrace  a  reflection,  so  man,  gazing  into  the  mirror  of  Nature  and  accepting  as  his  real  self  the <br/>senseless  clay  that  he  sees  reflected,  loses  the  opportunity  afforded  by  physical  life  to  unfold  his <br/>immortal,  invisible  Self. <br/><br/>An  ancient  initiate  once  said  that  the  living  are  ruled  by  the  dead.  Only  those  conversant  with  the <br/>Eleusinian  concept  of  life  could  understand  that  statement.  It  means  that  the  majority  of  people  are <br/>not  ruled  by  their  living  spirits  but  by  their  senseless  (hence  dead)  animal  personalities. <br/>Transmigration  and  reincarnation  were  taught  in  these  Mysteries,  but  in  a  somewhat  unusual  manner. <br/>It  was  believed  that  at  midnight  the  invisible  worlds  were  closest  to  the  Terrestrial  sphere  and  that <br/>souls  coming  into  material  existence  slipped  in  during  the  midnight  hour.  For  this  reason  many  of  the <br/>Eleusinian <br/><br/><br/>THE  RAPE  OF  PERSEPHONE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Thomassin's  Recucil  des  Figures,  Groupes,  Themes,  Fontaines,  Vases  et  autres  Omements. <br/><br/>Pluto,  the  lord  of  the  underworld,  represents  the  body  intelligence  of  man;  and  the  rape  of  Persephone  is  symbolic  of  the <br/>divine  nature  assaulted  and  defiled  by  the  animal  soul  and  dragged  downward  into  the  somber  darkness  of  Hades,  which <br/>is  here  used  as  a  synonym  for  the  material,  or  objective,  sphere  of  consciousness. <br/><br/>In  his  Disquisitions  upon  the  Painted  Greek  Vases,  James  Christie  presents  Meursius'  version  of  the  occurrences  taking <br/>place  during  the  nine  days  required  for  the  enactment  of  the  Greater  Eleusinian  Rites.  The  first  day  was  that  of  general <br/>meeting,  during  which  those  to  be  initiated  were  questioned  concerning  their  several  qualifications.  The  second  day  was <br/>spent  in  a  procession  to  the  sea,  possibly  for  the  submerging  of  a  image  of  the  presiding  goddess.  The  third  day  was <br/>opened  by  the  sacrifice  of  a  mullet.  On  the  fourth  day  the  mystic  basket  containing  certain  sacred  symbols  was  brought  to <br/>Eleusis,  accompanied  by  a  number  of  female  devotees  carrying  smaller  baskets.  On  the  evening  of  the  fifth  day  there  was  a <br/>torch  race,  on  the  sixth  a  procession  led  by  a  statue  of  lacchus,  and  on  the  seventh  an  athletic  contest.  The  eighth  day  was <br/>devoted  to  a  repetition  of  the  ceremonial  for  the  benefit  of  any  who  might  have  been  prevented  from  coming  sooner.  The <br/>ninth  and  last  day  was  devoted  to  the  deepest  philosophical  issues  of  the  Eleusinia,  during  which  an  urn  or  jar&#x2014;the <br/>symbol  of  Bacchus&#x2014;was  exhibited  as  an  emblem  of  supreme  importance. <br/><br/>p-  30 <br/><br/>ceremonies  were  performed  at  midnight.  Some  of  those  sleeping  spirits  who  had  failed  to  awaken <br/>their  higher  natures  during  the  earth  life  and  who  now  floated  around  in  the  invisible  worlds, <br/>surrounded  by  a  darkness  of  their  own  making,  occasionally  slipped  through  at  this  hour  and <br/>assumed  the  forms  of  various  creatures. <br/><br/>The  mystics  of  Eleusis  also  laid  stress  upon  the  evil  of  suicide,  explaining  that  there  was  a  profound <br/>mystery  concerning  this  crime  of  which  they  could  not  speak,  but  warning  their  disciples  that  a  great <br/>sorrow  comes  to  all  who  take  their  own  lives.  This,  in  substance,  constitutes  the  esoteric  doctrine <br/>given  to  the  initiates  of  the  Lesser  Mysteries.  As  the  degree  dealt  largely  with  the  miseries  of  those <br/>who  failed  to  make  the  best  use  of  their  philosophic  opportunities,  the  chambers  of  initiation  were <br/>subterranean  and  the  horrors  of  Hades  were  vividly  depicted  in  a  complicated  ritualistic  drama.  After <br/>passing  successfully  through  the  tortuous  passageways,  with  their  trials  and  dangers,  the  candidate <br/>received  the  honorary  title  of  Mystes.  This  meant  one  who  saw  through  a  veil  or  had  a  clouded  vision. <br/><br/><br/>It  also  signified  that  the  candidate  had  been  brought  up  to  the  veil,  which  would  be  torn  away  in  the <br/>higher  degree.  The  modern  word  mystic,  as  referring  to  a  seeker  after  truth  according  to  the  dictates <br/>of  the  heart  along  the  path  of  faith,  is  probably  derived  from  this  ancient  word,  for  faith  is  belief  in  the <br/>reality  of  things  unseen  or  veiled. <br/><br/>The  Greater  Mysteries  (into  which  the  candidate  was  admitted  only  after  he  had  successfully  passed <br/>through  the  ordeals  of  the  Lesser,  and  not  always  then)  were  sacred  to  Ceres,  the  mother  of <br/>Persephone,  and  represent  her  as  wandering  through  the  world  in  quest  of  her  abducted  daughter. <br/>Ceres  carried  two  torches,  intuition  and  reason,  to  aid  her  in  the  search  for  her  lost  child  (the  soul).  At <br/>last  she  found  Persephone  not  far  from  Eleusis,  and  out  of  gratitude  taught  the  people  there  to <br/>cultivate  corn,  which  is  sacred  to  her.  She  also  founded  the  Mysteries.  Ceres  appeared  before  Pluto, <br/>god  of  the  souls  of  the  dead,  and  pleaded  with  him  to  allow  Persephone  to  return  to  her  home.  This <br/>the  god  at  first  refused  to  do,  because  Persephone  had  eaten  of  the  pomegranate,  the  fruit  of  mortality. <br/>At  last,  however,  he  compromised  and  agreed  to  permit  Persephone  to  live  in  the  upper  world  half  of <br/>the  year  if  she  would  stay  with  him  in  the  darkness  of  Hades  for  the  remaining  half. <br/><br/>The  Greeks  believed  that  Persephone  was  a  manifestation  of  the  solar  energy,  which  in  the  winter <br/>months  lived  under  the  earth  with  Pluto,  but  in  the  summer  returned  again  with  the  goddess  of <br/>productiveness.  There  is  a  legend  that  the  flowers  loved  Persephone  and  that  every  year  when  she  left <br/>for  the  dark  realms  of  Pluto,  the  plants  and  shrubs  would  die  of  grief.  While  the  profane  and <br/>uninitiated  had  their  own  opinions  on  these  subjects,  the  truths  of  the  Greek  allegories  remained <br/>safely  concealed  by  the  priests,  who  alone  recognized  the  sublimity  of  these  great  philosophic  and <br/>religious  parables. <br/><br/>Thomas  Taylor  epitomizes  the  doctrines  of  the  Greater  Mysteries  in  the  following  statement:  &quot;The <br/>Greater  (Mysteries)  obscurely  intimated,  by  mystic  and  splendid  visions,  the  felicity  of  the  soul  both <br/>here  and  hereafter  when  purified  from  the  defilement  of  a  material  nature,  and  constantly  elevated  to <br/>the  realities  of  intellectual  (spiritual)  vision.&quot; <br/><br/>Just  as  the  Lesser  Mysteries  discussed  the  prenatal  epoch  of  man  when  the  consciousness  in  its  nine <br/>days  (embryologically,  months)  was  descending  into  the  realm  of  illusion  and  assuming  the  veil  of <br/>unreality,  so  the  Greater  Mysteries  discussed  the  principles  of  spiritual  regeneration  and  revealed  to <br/>initiates  not  only  the  simplest  but  also  the  most  direct  and  complete  method  of  liberating  their  higher <br/>natures  from  the  bondage  of  material  ignorance.  Like  Prometheus  chained  to  the  top  of  Mount <br/>Caucasus,  man's  higher  nature  is  chained  to  his  inadequate  personality.  The  nine  days  of  initiation <br/>were  also  symbolic  of  the  nine  spheres  through  which  the  human  soul  descends  during  the  process  of <br/>assuming  a  terrestrial  form.  The  secret  exercises  for  spiritual  unfoldment  given  to  disciples  of  the <br/>higher  degrees  are  unknown,  but  there  is  every  reason  to  believe  that  they  were  similar  to  the <br/>Brahmanic  Mysteries,  since  it  is  known  that  the  Eleusinian  ceremonies  were  closed  with  the  Sanskrit <br/>words  &quot;Konx  Om  Pax.&quot; <br/><br/>That  part  of  the  allegory  referring  to  the  two  six-month  periods  during  one  of  which  Persephone  must <br/>remain  with  Pluto,  while  during  the  other  she  may  revisit  the  upper  world,  offers  material  for  deep <br/>consideration.  It  is  probable  that  the  Eleusinians  realized  that  the  soul  left  the  body  during  steep,  or <br/>at  least  was  made  capable  of  leaving  by  the  special  training  which  undoubtedly  they  were  in  a  position <br/>to  give.  Thus  Persephone  would  remain  as  the  queen  of  Pluto's  realm  during  the  waking  hours,  but <br/>would  ascend  to  the  spiritual  worlds  during  the  periods  of  sleep.  The  initiate  was  taught  how  to <br/>intercede  with  Pluto  to  permit  Persephone  (the  initiate's  soul)  to  ascend  from  the  darkness  of  his <br/>material  nature  into  the  light  of  understanding.  When  thus  freed  from  the  shackles  of  clay  and <br/>crystallized  concepts,  the  initiate  was  liberated  not  only  for  the  period  of  his  life  but  for  all  eternity, <br/>for  never  thereafter  was  he  divested  of  those  soul  qualities  which  after  death  were  his  vehicles  for <br/>manifestation  and  expression  in  the  so-called  heaven  world. <br/><br/><br/>In  contrast  to  the  idea  of  Hades  as  a  state  of  darkness  below,  the  gods  were  said  to  inhabit  the  tops  of <br/><br/>mountains,  a  well-known  example  being  Mount  Olympus,  where  the  twelve  deities  of  the  Greek <br/>pantheon  were  said  to  dwell  together.  In  his  initiatory  wanderings  the  neophyte  therefore  entered <br/>chambers  of  ever-increasing  brilliancy  to  portray  the  ascent  of  the  spirit  from  the  lower  worlds  into <br/>the  realms  of  bliss.  As  the  climax  to  such  wanderings  he  entered  a  great  vaulted  room,  in  the  center  of <br/>which  stood  a  brilliantly  illumined  statue  of  the  goddess  Ceres.  Here,  in  the  presence  of  the <br/>hierophant  and  surrounded  by  priests  in  magnificent  robes,  he  was  instructed  in  the  highest  of  the <br/>secret  mysteries  of  the  Eleusis.  At  the  conclusion  of  this  ceremony  he  was  hailed  as  an  Epoptes,  which <br/>means  one  who  has  beheld  or  seen  directly.  For  this  reason  also  initiation  was  termed  autopsy.  The <br/>Epoptes  was  then  given  certain  sacred  books,  probably  written  in  cipher,  together  with  tablets  of <br/>stone  on  which  secret  instructions  were  engraved. <br/><br/>In  The  Obelisk  in  Freemasonry,  John  A.  Weisse  describes  the  officiating  personages  of  the  Eleusinian <br/>Mysteries  as  consisting  of  a  male  and  a  female  hierophant  who  directed  the  initiations;  a  male  and  a <br/>female  torchbearer;  a  male  herald;  and  a  male  and  a  female  altar  attendant.  There  were  also <br/>numerous  minor  officials.  He  states  that,  according  to  Porphyry,  the  hierophant  represents  Plato's <br/>Demiurgus,  or  Creator  of  the  world;  the  torch  bearer,  the  Sun;  the  altar  man,  the  Moon;  the  herald, <br/>Hermes,  or  Mercury;  and  the  other  officials,  minor  stars. <br/><br/>From  the  records  available,  a  number  of  strange  and  apparently  supernatural  phenomena <br/>accompanied  the  rituals.  Many  initiates  claim  to  have  actually  seen  the  living  gods  themselves. <br/>Whether  this  was  the  result  of  religious  ecstasy  or  the  actual  cooperation  of  invisible  powers  with  the <br/>visible  priests  must  remain  a  mystery.  In  The  Metamorphosis,  or  Golden  Ass,  Apuleius  thus  describes <br/>what  in  all  probability  is  his  initiation  into  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries: <br/><br/>&quot;I  approached  to  the  confines  of  death,  and  having  trod  on  the  threshold  of  Proserpine  I,  returned <br/>from  it,  being  carried  through  all  the  elements.  At  midnight  I  saw  the  sun  shining  with  a  splendid <br/>light;  and  I  manifestly  drew  near  to,  the  gods  beneath,  and  the  gods  above,  and  proximately  adored <br/>them.&quot; <br/><br/>Women  and  children  were  admitted  to  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  and  at  one  time  there  were  literally <br/>thousands  of  initiates.  Because  this  vast  host  was  not  prepared  for  the  highest  spiritual  and  mystical <br/>doctrines,  a  division  necessarily  took  place  within  the  society  itself.  The  higher  teachings  were  given <br/>to  only  a  limited  number  of  initiates  who,  because  of  superior  mentality,  showed  a  comprehensive <br/>grasp  of  their  underlying  philosophical  concepts.  Socrates  refused  to  be  initiated  into  the  Eleusinian <br/>Mysteries,  for  knowing  its  principles  without  being  a  member  of  the  order  he  realized  that <br/>membership  would  seal  his  tongue.  That  the  Mysteries  of  Eleusis  were  based  upon  great  and  eternal <br/>truths  is  attested  by  the  veneration  in  which  they  were  held  by  the  great  minds  of  the  ancient  world. <br/>M.  Ouvaroff  asks,  &quot;Would  Pindar,  Plato,  Cicero,  Epictetus,  have  spoken  of  them  with  such  admiration, <br/>if  the  hierophant  had  satisfied  himself  with  loudly  proclaiming  his  own  opinions,  or  those  of  his <br/>order?&quot; <br/><br/>The  garments  in  which  candidates  were  initiated  were  preserved  for  many  years  and  were  believed  to <br/>possess  almost  sacred  properties.  Just  as  the  soul  can  have  no  covering  save  wisdom  and  virtue,  so <br/>the  candidates&#x2014;being  as  yet  without  true  knowledge&#x2014;were  presented  to  the  Mysteries  unclothed, <br/>being  first:  given  the  skin  of  an  animal  and  later  a  consecrated  robe  to  symbolize  the  philosophical <br/>teachings  received  by  the  initiate.  During  the  course  of  initiation  the  candidate <br/><br/><br/>CERES,  THE  PATRON  OF  THE  MYSTERIES. <br/><br/><br/>From  a  mural  painting  in  Pompeii. <br/><br/>Ceres,  or  Demeter,  was  the  daughter  of  Kronos  and  Rhea,  and  by  Zeus  the  mother  of  Persephone.  Some  beUeve  her  to  be <br/>the  goddess  of  the  earth,  but  more  correctly  she  is  the  deity  protecting  agriculture  in  general  and  corn  in  particular.  The <br/>Poppy  is  sacred  to  Ceres  and  she  is  often  shown  carrying  or  ornamented  by  a  garland  of  these  flowers.  In  the  Mysteries, <br/>Ceres  represented  riding  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  winged  serpents. <br/><br/>p-  31 <br/><br/><br/>THE  PROCESSIONAL  OF  THE  BACCHIC  RITES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Ovid's  Metamorphosis. <br/><br/>In  the  initiation,  of  the  Bacchic  Mysteries,  the  role  of  Bacchus  is  played  by  the  candidate  who,  set  upon  by  priests  in  the <br/>guise  of  the  Titans,  is  slain  and  finally  restored  to  life  amidst  great  rejoicing.  The  Bacchic  Mysteries  were  given  every  three <br/>years,  and  like  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  were  divided  into  two  degrees.  The  initiates  were  crowned  with  myrtle  and  ivy, <br/>plants  which  were  sacred  to  Bacchus. <br/><br/>In  the  Anacalypsis,  Godfrey  Higgins  conclusively  establishes  Bacchus  (Dionysos)  as  one  of  the  early  pagan  forms  of  the <br/>Christos  myth,  &quot;The  birthplace  of  Bacchus,  called  Sabazius  or  Sabaoth,  was  claimed  by  several  places  in  Greece;  but  on <br/><br/><br/>Mount  Zelmisus,  in  Thrace,  his  worship  seems  to  have  been  chiefly  celebrated.  He  was  born  of  a  virgin  on  the  25th  of <br/>December;  he  performed  great  miracles  for  the  good  of  mankind;  particularly  one  in  which  he  changed  water  into  wine; <br/>he  rode  in  a  triumphal  procession  on  an  ass;  he  was  put  to  death  by  the  Titans,  and  rose  again  from  the  dead  on  the  25th <br/>of  March:  he  was  always  called  the  Saviour.  In  his  mysteries,  he  was  shown  to  the  people,  as  an  infant  is  by  the  Christians <br/>at  this  day,  on  Christmas  Day  morning  in  Rome.&quot; <br/><br/>While  Apollo  most  generally  represents  the  sun,  Bacchus  is  also  a  form  of  solar  energy,  for  his  resurrection  was <br/>accomplished  with  the  assistance  of  Apollo.  The  resurrection  of  Bacchus  signifies  merely  the  extraction  or <br/>disentanglement  of  the  various  Parts  of  the  Bacchic  constitution  from  the  Titanic  constitution  of  the  world.  This  is <br/>symbolized  by  the  smoke  or  soot  rising  from  the  burned  bodies  of  the  Titans.  The  soul  is  symbolized  by  smoke  because  it <br/>is  extracted  by  the  fire  of  the  Mysteries.  Smoke  signifies  the  ascension  of  the  soul,  far  evolution  is  the  process  of  the  soul <br/>rising,  like  smoke,  from  the  divinely  consumed  material  mass.  At  me  time  the  Bacchic  Rites  were  of  a  high  order,  but  later <br/>they  became  much  degraded .  The  Bacchanalia,  or  orgies  of  Bacchus,  are  famous  in  literature. <br/><br/>p-  32 <br/><br/>passed  through  two  gates.  The  first  led  downward  into  the  lower  worlds  and  symbolized  his  birth  into <br/>ignorance.  The  second  led  upward  into  a  room  brilliantly  lighted  by  unseen  lamps,  in  which  was  the <br/>statue  of  Ceres  and  which  symbolized  the  upper  world,  or  the  abode  of  Light  and  Truth.  Strabo  states <br/>that  the  great  temple  of  Eleusis  would  hold  between  twenty  and  thirty  thousand  people.  The  caves <br/>dedicated  by  Zarathustra  also  had  these  two  doors,  symbolizing  the  avenues  of  birth  and  death. <br/><br/>The  following  paragraph  from  Porphyry  gives  a  fairly  adequate  conception  of  Eleusinian  symbolism: <br/>&quot;God  being  a  luminous  principle,  residing  in  the  midst  of  the  most  subtile  fire,  he  remains  for  ever <br/>invisible  to  the  eyes  of  those  who  do  not  elevate  themselves  above  material  life:  on  this  account,  the <br/>sight  of  transparent  bodies,  such  as  crystal,  Parian  marble,  and  even  ivory,  recalls  the  idea  of  divine <br/>light;  as  the  sight  of  gold  excites  an  idea  of  its  purity,  for  gold  cannot  he  sullied.  Some  have  thought  by <br/>a  black  stone  was  signified  the  invisibility  of  the  divine  essence.  To  express  supreme  reason,  the <br/>Divinity  was  represented  under  the  human  form&#x2014;and  beautiful,  for  God  is  the  source  of  beauty;  of <br/>different  ages,  and  in  various  attitudes,  sitting  or  upright;  of  one  or  the  other  sex,  as  a  virgin  or  a <br/>young  man,  a  husband  or  a  bride,  that  all  the  shades  and  gradations  might  be  marked.  Every  thing <br/>luminous  was  subsequently  attributed  to  the  gods;  the  sphere,  and  all  that  is  spherical,  to  the  universe, <br/>to  the  sun  and  the  moon&#x2014;sometimes  to  Fortune  and  to  Hope.  The  circle,  and  all  circular  figures,  to <br/>eternity&#x2014; to  the  celestial  movements;  to  the  circles  and  zones  of  the  heavens.  The  section  of  circles,  to <br/>the  phases  of  the  moon;  and  pyramids  and  obelisks,  to  the  igneous  principle,  and  through  that  to  the <br/>gods  of  Heaven.  A  cone  expresses  the  sun,  a  cylinder  the  earth;  the  phallus  and  triangle  (a  symbol  of <br/>the  matrix)  designate  generation.&quot;  (From  Essay  on  the  Mysteries  of  Eleusis  by  M.  Ouvaroff.) <br/><br/>The  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  according  to  Heckethorn,  survived  all  others  and  did  not  cease  to  exist  as <br/>an  institution  until  nearly  four  hundred  years  after  Christ,  when  they  were  finally  suppressed  by <br/>Theodosius  (styled  the  Great),  who  cruelly  destroyed  all  who  did  not  accept  the  Christian  faith.  Of  this <br/>greatest  of  all  philosophical  institutions  Cicero  said  that  it  taught  men  not  only  how  to  live  but  also <br/>how  to  die. <br/><br/>THE  ORPHIC  MYSTERIES <br/><br/>Orpheus,  the  Thracian  bard,  the  great  initiator  of  the  Greeks,  ceased  to  be  known  as  a  man  and  was <br/>celebrated  as  a  divinity  several  centuries  before  the  Christian  Era.  &quot;As  to  Orpheus  himself  *  *  *, &quot; <br/>writes  Thomas  Taylor,  &quot;scarcely  a  vestige  of  his  life  is  to  be  found  amongst  the  immense  ruins  of  time. <br/>For  who  has  ever  been  able  to  affirm  any  thing  with  certainty  of  his  origin,  his  age,  his  country,  and <br/>condition?  This  alone  may  be  depended  on,  from  general  assent,  that  there  formerly  lived  a  person <br/>named  Orpheus,  who  was  the  founder  of  theology  among  the  Greeks;  the  institutor  of  their  lives  and <br/>morals;  the  first  of  prophets,  and  the  prince  of  poets;  himself  the  offspring  of  a  Muse;  who  taught  the <br/>Greeks  their  sacred  rites  and  mysteries,  and  from  whose  wisdom,  as  from  a  perennial  and  abundant <br/><br/><br/>fountain,  the  divine  muse  of  Homer  and  the  sublime  theology  of  Pj^hagoras  and  Plato  flowed.&quot;  (See <br/>The  Mystical  Hymns  of  Orpheus.) <br/><br/>Orpheus  was  founder  of  the  Grecian  mythological  system  which  he  used  as  the  medium  for  the <br/>promulgation  of  his  philosophical  doctrines.  The  origin  of  his  philosophy  is  uncertain.  He  may  have <br/>got  it  from  the  Brahmins,  there  being  legends  to  the  effect  that  he  got  it  was  a  Hindu,  his  name <br/>possibly  being  derived  from  opcpaviog,  meaning  &quot;dark.&quot;  Orpheus  was  initiated  into  the  Egyptian <br/>Mysteries,  from  which  he  secured  extensive  knowledge  of  magic,  astrology,  sorcery,  and  medicine. <br/>The  Mysteries  of  the  Cabiri  at  Samothrace  were  also  conferred  upon  him,  and  these  undoubtedly <br/>contributed  to  his  knowledge  of  medicine  and  music. <br/><br/>The  romance  of  Orpheus  and  Eurydice  is  one  of  the  tragic  episodes  of  Greek  mythology  and <br/>apparently  constitutes  the  outstanding  feature <br/><br/>p-  32 <br/><br/>of  the  Orphic  Rite.  Eurydice,  in  her  attempt  to  escape  from  a  villain  seeking  to  seduce  her,  died  from <br/>the  venom  of  a  poisonous  serpent  which  stung  her  in  the  heel.  Orpheus,  penetrating  to  the  very  heart <br/>of  the  underworld,  so  charmed  Pluto  and  Persephone  with  the  beauty  of  his  music  that  they  agreed  to <br/>permit  Eurydice  to  return  to  life  if  Orpheus  could  lead  her  back  to  the  sphere  of  the  living  without <br/>once  looking  round  to  see  if  she  were  following.  So  great  was  his  fear,  however,  that  she  would  stray <br/>from  him  that  he  turned  his  head,  and  Eurydice  with  a  heartbroken  cry  was  swept  back  into  the  land <br/>of  death. <br/><br/>Orpheus  wandered  the  earth  for  a  while  disconsolate,  and  there  are  several  conflicting  accounts  of  the <br/><br/>manner  of  his  death.  Some  declare  that  he  was  slain  by  a  bolt  of  lightning;  others,  that  failing  to  save <br/>his  beloved  Eurydice,  he  committed  suicide.  The  generally  accepted  version  of  his  death,  however,  is <br/>that  he  was  torn  to  pieces  by  Ciconian  women  whose  advances  he  had  spurned.  In  the  tenth  book  of <br/>Plato's  Republic  it  is  declared  that,  because  of  his  sad  fate  at  the  hands  of  women,  the  soul  that  had <br/>once  been  Orpheus,  upon  being  destined  to  live  again  in  the  physical  world,  chose  rather  to  return  in <br/>the  body  of  a  swan  than  be  born  of  woman.  The  head  of  Orpheus,  after  being  torn  from  his  body,  was <br/>cast  with  his  lyre  into  the  river  Hebrus,  down  which  it  floated  to  the  sea,  where,  wedging  in  a  cleft  in  a <br/>rock,  it  gave  oracles  for  many  years.  The  lyre,  after  being  stolen  from  its  shrine  and  working  the <br/>destruction  of  the  thief,  was  picked  up  by  the  gods  and  fashioned  into  a  constellation. <br/><br/>Orpheus  has  long  been  sung  as  the  patron  of  music.  On  his  seven-stringed  lyre  he  played  such  perfect <br/>harmonies  that  the  gods  themselves  were  moved  to  acclaim  his  power.  When  he  touched  the  strings <br/>of  his  instrument  the  birds  and  beasts  gathered  about  him,  and  as  he  wandered  through  the  forests <br/>his  enchanting  melodies  caused  even  the  ancient  trees  with  mighty  effort  to  draw  their  gnarled  roots <br/>from  out  the  earth  and  follow  him.  Orpheus  is  one  of  the  many  Immortals  who  have  sacrificed <br/>themselves  that  mankind  might  have  the  wisdom  of  the  gods.  By  the  symbolism  of  his  music  he <br/>communicated  the  divine  secrets  to  humanity,  and  several  authors  have  declared  that  the  gods, <br/>though  loving  him,  feared  that  he  would  overthrow  their  kingdom  and  therefore  reluctantly <br/>encompassed  his  destruction. <br/><br/>As  time  passed  on  the  historical  Orpheus  became  hopelessly  confounded  with  the  doctrine  he <br/>represented  and  eventually  became  the  symbol  of  the  Greek  school  of  the  ancient  wisdom.  Thus <br/>Orpheus  was  declared  to  be  the  son  of  Apollo,  the  divine  and  perfect  truth,  and  Calliope,  the  Muse  of <br/>harmony  and  rhythm.  In  other  words,  Orpheus  is  the  secret  doctrine  (Apollo)  revealed  through  music <br/>(Calliope).  Eurydice  is  humanity  dead  from  the  sting  of  the  serpent  of  false  knowledge  and <br/>imprisoned  in  the  underworld  of  ignorance.  In  this  allegory  Orpheus  signifies  theology,  which  wins <br/>her  from  the  king  of  the  dead  but  fails  to  accomplish  her  resurrection  because  it  falsely  estimates  and <br/>mistrusts  the  innate  understanding  within  the  human  soul.  The  Ciconian  women  who  tore  Orpheus <br/><br/><br/>limb  from  limb  symbolize  the  various  contending  theological  factions  which  destroy  the  body  of  Truth. <br/>They  cannot  accomplish  this,  however,  until  their  discordant  cries  drown  out  the  harmony  drawn  by <br/>Orpheus  from  his  magic  lyre.  The  head  of  Orpheus  signifies  the  esoteric  doctrines  of  his  cult.  These <br/>doctrines  continue  to  live  and  speak  even  after  his  body  (the  cult)  has  been  destroyed.  The  lyre  is  the <br/>secret  teaching  of  Orpheus;  the  seven  strings  are  the  seven  divine  truths  which  are  the  keys  to <br/>universal  knowledge.  The  differing  accounts  of  his  death  represent  the  various  means  used  to  destroy <br/>the  secret  teachings:  wisdom  can  die  in  many  ways  at  the  same  time.  The  allegory  of  Orpheus <br/>incarnating  in  the  white  swan  merely  signifies  that  the  spiritual  truths  he  promulgated  will  continue <br/>and  will  be  taught  by  the  illumined  initiates  of  all  future  ages.  The  swan  is  the  symbol  of  the  initiates <br/>of  the  Mysteries;  it  is  a  symbol  also  of  the  divine  power  which  is  the  progenitor  of  the  world. <br/><br/>THE  BACCHIC  AND  DIONYSIAC  RITES <br/><br/>The  Bacchic  Rite  centers  around  the  allegory  of  the  youthful  Bacchus  (Dionysos  or  Zagreus)  being <br/>torn  to  pieces  by  the  Titans.  These  giants  accomplished  the  destruction  of  Bacchus  by  causing  him  to <br/>become  fascinated  by  his  own  image  in  a  mirror.  After  dismembering  him,  the  Titans  first  boiled  the <br/>pieces  in  water  and  afterwards  roasted  them.  Pallas  rescued  the  heart  of  the  murdered  god,  and  by <br/>this  precaution  Bacchus  (Dionysos)  was  enabled  to  spring  forth  again  in  all  his  former  glory.  Jupiter, <br/>the  Demiurgus,  beholding  the  crime  of  the  Titans,  hurled  his  thunderbolts  and  slew  them,  burning <br/>their  bodies  to  ashes  with  heavenly  fire.  Our  of  the  ashes  of  the  Titans&#x2014;which  also  contained  a <br/>portion  of  the  flesh  of  Bacchus,  whose  body  they  had  partly  devoured&#x2014;the  human  race  was  created. <br/>Thus  the  mundane  life  of  every  man  was  said  to  contain  a  portion  of  the  Bacchic  life. <br/><br/>For  this  reason  the  Greek  Mysteries  warned  against  suicide.  He  who  attempts  to  destroy  himself <br/>raises  his  hand  against  the  nature  of  Bacchus  within  him,  since  man's  body  is  indirectly  the  tomb  of <br/>this  god  and  consequently  must  be  preserved  with  the  greatest  care. <br/><br/>Bacchus  (Dionysos)  represents  the  rational  soul  of  the  inferior  world.  He  is  the  chief  of  the  Titans&#x2014; <br/>the  artificers  of  the  mundane  spheres.  The  Pythagoreans  called  him  the  Titanic  monad.  Thus  Bacchus <br/>is  the  all-inclusive  idea  of  the  Titanic  sphere  and  the  Titans&#x2014; or  gods  of  the  fragments&#x2014; the  active <br/>agencies  by  means  of  which  universal  substance  is  fashioned  into  the  pattern  of  this  idea.  The  Bacchic <br/>state  signifies  the  unity  of  the  rational  soul  in  a  state  of  self-knowledge,  and  the  Titanic  state  the <br/>diversity  of  the  rational  soul  which,  being  scattered  throughout  creation,  loses  the  consciousness  of  its <br/>own  essential  one-ness.  The  mirror  into  which  Bacchus  gazes  and  which  is  the  cause  of  his  fall  is  the <br/>great  sea  of  illusion&#x2014; the  lower  world  fashioned  by  the  Titans.  Bacchus  (the  mundane  rational  soul), <br/>seeing  his  image  before  him,  accepts  the  image  as  a  likeness  of  himself  and  ensouls  the  likeness;  that <br/>is,  the  rational  idea  ensouls  its  reflection&#x2014; the  irrational  universe.  By  ensouling  the  irrational  image  it <br/>implants  in  it  the  urge  to  become  like  its  source,  the  rational  image.  Therefore  the  ancients  said  that <br/>man  does  not  know  the  gods  by  logic  or  by  reason  but  rather  by  realizing  the  presence  of  the  gods <br/>within  himself. <br/><br/>After  Bacchus  gazed  into  the  mirror  and  followed  his  own  reflection  into  matter,  the  rational  soul  of <br/>the  world  was  broken  up  and  distributed  by  the  Titans  throughout  the  mundane  sphere  of  which  it  is <br/>the  essential  nature,  but  the  heart,  or  source,  of  it  they  could  not:  scatter.  The  Titans  took  the <br/>dismembered  body  of  Bacchus  and  boiled  it  in  water&#x2014; symbol  of  immersion  in  the  material  universe&#x2014; <br/>which  represents  the  incorporation  of  the  Bacchic  principle  in  form.  The  pieces  were  afterwards <br/>roasted  to  signify  the  subsequent  ascension  of  the  spiritual  nature  out  of  form. <br/><br/>When  Jupiter,  the  father  of  Bacchus  and  the  Demiurgus  of  the  universe,  saw  that  the  Titans  were <br/>hopelessly  involving  the  rational  or  divine  idea  by  scattering  its  members  through  the  constituent <br/>parts  of  the  lower  world,  he  slew  the  Titans  in  order  that  the  divine  idea  might  not  be  entirely  lost. <br/>From  the  ashes  of  the  Titans  he  formed  mankind,  whose  purpose  of  existence  was  to  preserve  and <br/>eventually  to  release  the  Bacchic  idea,  or  rational  soul,  from  the  Titanic  fabrication.  Jupiter,  being  the <br/><br/><br/>Demiurgus  and  fabricator  of  the  material  universe,  is  the  third  person  of  the  Creative  Triad, <br/><br/>consequently  the  Lord  of  Death,  for  death  exists  only  in  the  lower  sphere  of  being  over  which  he <br/>presides.  Disintegration  takes  place  so  that  reintegration  may  follow  upon  a  higher  level  of  form  or <br/>intelligence.  The  thunderbolts  of  Jupiter  are  emblematic  of  his  disintegrative  power;  they  reveal  the <br/>purpose  of  death,  which  is  to  rescue  the  rational  soul  from  the  devouring  power  of  the  irrational <br/>nature. <br/><br/>Man  is  a  composite  creature,  his  lower  nature  consisting  of  the  fragments  of  the  Titans  and  his  higher <br/>nature  the  sacred,  immortal  flesh  (life)  of  Bacchus.  Therefore  man  is  capable  of  either  a  Titanic <br/>(irrational)  or  a  Bacchic  (rational)  existence.  The  Titans  of  Hesiod,  who  were  twelve  in  number,  are <br/>probably  analogous  to  the  celestial  zodiac,  whereas  the  Titans  who  murdered  and  dismembered <br/>Bacchus  represent  the  zodiacal  powers  distorted  by  their  involvement  in  the  material  world.  Thus <br/>Bacchus  represents  the  sun  who  is  dismembered  by  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  and  from  whose  body  the <br/>universe  is  formed.  When  the  terrestrial  forms  were  created  from  the  various  parts  of  his  body  the <br/>sense  of  wholeness  was  lost  and  the  sense  of  separateness  established.  The  heart  of  Bacchus,  which <br/>was  saved  by  Pallas,  or  Minerva,  was  lifted  out  of  the  four  elements  symbolized  by  his  dismembered <br/>body  and  placed  in  the  ether.  The  heart  of  Bacchus  is  the  immortal  center  of  the  rational  soul. <br/><br/>After  the  rational  soul  had  been  distributed  throughout  creation  and  the  nature  of  man,  the  Bacchic <br/>Mysteries  were  instituted  for  the  purpose  of  disentangling  it  from  the  irrational  Titanic  nature.  This <br/>disentanglement  was  the  process  of  lifting  the  soul  out  of  the  state  of  separateness  into  that  of  unity. <br/>The  various  parts  and  members  of  Bacchus  were  collected  from  the  different  corners  of  the  earth. <br/>When  all  the  rational  parts  are  gathered  Bacchus  is  resurrected. <br/><br/>The  Rites  of  Dionysos  were  very  similar  to  those  of  Bacchus,  and  by  many  these  two  gods  are <br/>considered  as  one.  Statues  of  Dionysos  were  carried  in  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  especially  the  lesser <br/>degrees.  Bacchus,  representing  the  soul  of  the  mundane  sphere,  was  capable  of  an  infinite  multiplicity <br/>of  form  and  designations.  Dionysos  apparently  was  his  solar  aspect. <br/><br/>The  Dionysiac  Architects  constituted  an  ancient  secret  society,  in  principles  and  doctrines  much  like <br/>the  modern  Freemasonic  Order.  They  were  an  organization  of  builders  bound  together  by  their  secret <br/>knowledge  of  the  relationship  between  the  earthly  and  the  divine  sciences  of  architectonics.  They <br/>were  supposedly  employed  by  King  Solomon  in  the  building  of  his  Temple,  although  they  were  not <br/>Jews,  nor  did  they  worship  the  God  of  the  Jews,  being  followers  of  Bacchus  and  Dionysos.  The <br/>Dionysiac  Architects  erected  many  of  the  great  monuments  of  antiquity.  They  possessed  a  secret <br/>language  and  a  system  of  marking  their  stones.  They  had  annual  convocations  and  sacred  feasts.  The <br/>exact  nature  of  their  doctrines  is  unknown.  It  is  believed  that  CHiram  Abiff  was  an  initiate  of  this <br/>society. <br/><br/><br/>Atlantis  and  the  Gods  of  Antiquity <br/><br/><br/>p.  33 <br/><br/>ATLANTIS  is  the  subject  of  a  short  but  important  article  appearing  in  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Board <br/>of  Regents  of  The  Smithsonian  Institution  for  the  year  ending  June  30th,  1915.  The  author,  M.  Pierre <br/>Termier,  a  member  of  the  Academy  of  Sciences  and  Director  of  Service  of  the  Geologic  Chart  of <br/>France,  in  1912  delivered  a  lecture  on  the  Atlantean  hypothesis  before  the  Institut  Oceanographique; <br/>it  is  the  translated  notes  of  this  remarkable  lecture  that  are  published  in  the  Smithsonian  report. <br/><br/>&quot;After  a  long  period  of  disdainful  indifference,&quot;  writes  M.  Termier,  &quot;observe  how^  in  the  last  few  years <br/>science  is  returning  to  the  study  of  Atlantis.  How  many  naturalists,  geologists,  zoologists,  or  botanists <br/>are  asking  one  another  today  whether  Plato  has  not  transmitted  to  us,  with  slight  amplification,  a <br/>page  from  the  actual  history  of  mankind.  No  affirmation  is  yet  permissible;  but  it  seems  more  and <br/>more  evident  that  a  vast  region,  continental  or  made  up  of  great  islands,  has  collapsed  west  of  the <br/>Pillars  of  Hercules,  otherwise  called  the  Strait  of  Gibraltar,  and  that  its  collapse  occurred  in  the  not <br/>far  distant  past.  In  any  event,  the  question  of  Atlantis  is  placed  anew  before  men  of  science;  and  since <br/>I  do  not  believe  that  it  can  ever  be  solved  without  the  aid  of  oceanography,  I  have  thought  it  natural  to <br/>discuss  it  here,  in  this  temple  of  maritime  science,  and  to  call  to  such  a  problem,  long  scorned  but <br/>now  being  revived,  the  attention  of  oceanographers,  as  well  as  the  attention  of  those  who,  though <br/>immersed  in  the  tumult  of  cities,  lend  an  ear  to  the  distant  murmur  of  the  sea.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  lecture  M.  Termier  presents  geologic,  geographic,  and  zoologic  data  in  substantiation  of  the <br/>Atlantis  theory.  Figuratively  draining  the  entire  bed  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  he  considers  the <br/>inequalities  of  its  basin  and  cites  locations  on  a  line  from  the  Azores  to  Iceland  where  dredging  has <br/>brought  lava  to  the  surface  from  a  depth  of  3,000  meters.  The  volcanic  nature  of  the  islands  now <br/>existing  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  corroborates  Plato's  statement  that  the  Atlantean  continent  was <br/>destroyed  by  volcanic  cataclysms.  M.  Termier  also  advances  the  conclusions  of  a  young  French <br/>zoologist,  M.  Louis  Germain,  who  admitted  the  existence  of  an  Atlantic  continent  connected  with  the <br/>Iberian  Peninsula  and  with  Mauritania  and  prolonged  toward  the  south  so  as  to  include  some  regions <br/>of  desert  climate.  M.  Termier  concludes  his  lecture  with  a  graphic  picture  of  the  engulfment  of  that <br/>continent. <br/><br/>The  description  of  the  Atlantean  civilization  given  by  Plato  in  the  Critias  may  be  summarized  as <br/>follows.  In  the  first  ages  the  gods  divided  the  earth  among  themselves,  proportioning  it  according  to <br/>their  respective  dignities.  Each  became  the  peculiar  deity  of  his  ovm  allotment  and  established <br/>therein  temples  to  himself,  ordained  a  priestcraft,  and  instituted  a  system  of  sacrifice.  To  Poseidon <br/>was  given  the  sea  and  the  island  continent  of  Atlantis.  In  the  midst  of  the  island  was  a  mountain <br/>which  was  the  dwelling  place  of  three  earth-born  primitive  human  beings&#x2014;Evenor;  his  wife,  Leucipe; <br/>and  their  only  daughter,  Cleito.  The  maiden  was  very  beautiful,  and  after  the  sudden  death  of  her <br/>parents  she  was  wooed  by  Poseidon,  who  begat  by  her  five  pairs  of  male  children.  Poseidon <br/>apportioned  his  continent  among  these  ten,  and  Atlas,  the  eldest,  he  made  overlord  of  the  other  nine. <br/>Poseidon  further  called  the  country  Atlantis  and  the  surrounding  sea  the  Atlantic  in  honor  of  Atlas. <br/>Before  the  birth  of  his  ten  sons,  Poseidon  divided  the  continent  and  the  coastwise  sea  into  concentric <br/>zones  of  land  and  water,  which  were  as  perfect  as  though  turned  upon  a  lathe.  Two  zones  of  land  and <br/>three  of  water  surrounded  the  central  island,  which  Poseidon  caused  to  be  irrigated  with  two  springs <br/>of  water&#x2014;one  warm  and  the  other  cold. <br/><br/>The  descendants  of  Atlas  continued  as  rulers  of  Atlantis,  and  with  wise  government  and  industry <br/>elevated  the  country  to  a  position  of  surpassing  dignity.  The  natural  resources  of  Atlantis  were <br/>apparently  limitless.  Precious  metals  were  mined,  wild  animals  domesticated,  and  perfumes  distilled <br/>from  its  fragrant  flowers.  While  enjoying  the  abundance  natural  to  their  semitropic  location,  the <br/><br/><br/>Atlanteans  employed  themselves  also  in  the  erection  of  palaces,  temples,  and  docks.  They  bridged  the <br/><br/>zones  of  sea  and  later  dug  a  deep  canal  to  connect  the  outer  ocean  with  the  central  island,  where  stood <br/>the  palaces  And  temple  of  Poseidon,  which  excelled  all  other  structures  in  magnificence.  A  network  of <br/>bridges  and  canals  was  created  by  the  Atlanteans  to  unite  the  various  parts  of  their  kingdom. <br/><br/>Plato  then  describes  the  white,  black,  and  red  stones  which  they  quarried  from  beneath  their <br/>continent  and  used  in  the  construction  of  public  buildings  and  docks.  They  circumscribed  each  of  the <br/>land  zones  with  a  wall,  the  outer  wall  being  covered  with  brass,  the  middle  with  tin,  and  the  inner, <br/>which  encompassed  the  citadel,  with  orichalch.  The  citadel,  on  the  central  island,  contained  the  pal <br/>aces,  temples,  and  other  public  buildings.  In  its  center,  surrounded  by  a  wall  of  gold,  was  a  sanctuary <br/>dedicated  to  Cleito  and  Poseidon.  Here  the  first  ten  princes  of  the  island  were  born  and  here  each  year <br/>their  descendants  brought  offerings.  Poseidon's  own  temple,  its  exterior  entirely  covered  with  silver <br/>and  its  pinnacles  with  gold,  also  stood  within  the  citadel.  The  interior  of  the  temple  was  of  ivory,  gold, <br/>silver,  and  orichalch,  even  to  the  pillars  and  floor.  The  temple  contained  a  colossal  statue  of  Poseidon <br/>standing  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  six  winged  horses,  about  him  a  hundred  Nereids  riding  on  dolphins. <br/>Arranged  outside  the  building  were  golden  statues  of  the  first  ten  kings  and  their  wives. <br/><br/>In  the  groves  and  gardens  were  hot  and  cold  springs.  There  were  numerous  temples  to  various  deities, <br/>places  of  exercise  for  men  and  for  beasts,  public  baths,  and  a  great  race  course  for  horses.  At  various <br/>vantage  points  on  the  zones  were  fortifications,  and  to  the  great  harbor  came  vessels  from  every <br/>maritime  nation.  The  zones  were  so  thickly  populated  that  the  sound  of  human  voices  was  ever  in  the <br/>air. <br/><br/>That  part  of  Atlantis  facing  the  sea  was  described  as  lofty  and  precipitous,  but  about  the  central  city <br/>was  a  plain  sheltered  by  mountains  renowned  for  their  size,  number,  and  beauty.  The  plain  yielded <br/>two  crops  each  year,,  in  the  winter  being  watered  by  rains  and  in  the  summer  by  immense  irrigation <br/>canals,  which  were  also  used  for  transportation.  The  plain  was  divided  into  sections,  and  in  time  of <br/>war  each  section  supplied  its  quota  of  fighting  men  and  chariots. <br/><br/>The  ten  governments  differed  from  each  other  in  details  concerning  military  requirements.  Each  of <br/>the  kings  of  Atlantis  had  complete  control  over  his  own  kingdom,  but  their  mutual  relationships  were <br/>governed  by  a  code  engraved  by  the  first  ten  kings  on  a  column'  of  orichalch  standing  in  the  temple  of <br/>Poseidon.  At  alternate  intervals  of  five  and  six  years  a  pilgrimage  was  made  to  this  temple  that  equal <br/>honor  might  be  conferred  upon  both  the  odd  and  the  even  numbers.  Here,  with  appropriate  sacrifice, <br/>each  king  renewed  his <br/><br/><br/>THE  SCHEME  OF  THE  UNIVERSE  ACCORDING  TO  THE  GREEKS  AND  ROMANS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Cartari's  Imagini  degli  Dei  degli  Antichi. <br/><br/>By  ascending  successively  through  the  fiery  sphere  of  Hades,  the  spheres  of  water,  Earth,  and  air,  and  the  heavens  of  the <br/>moon,  the  plane  of  Mercury  is  reached.  Above  Mercury  are  the  planes  of  Venus,  the  sun.  Mars,  Jupiter,  and  Saturn,  the <br/>latter  containing  the  symbols  of  the  Zodiacal  constellations.  Above  the  arch  of  the  heavens  (Saturn)  is  the  dwelling  Place <br/>of  the  different  powers  controlling  the  universe.  The  supreme  council  of  the  gods  is  composed  of  twelve  deities&#x2014;six  male <br/>and  six  female&#x2014;which  correspond  to  the  positive  and  negative  signs  of  the  zodiac.  The  six  gods  are  Jupiter,  Vulcan,  Apollo, <br/>Mars,  Neptune,  and  Mercury;  the  six  goddesses  are  Juno,  Ceres,  Vesta,  Minerva,  Venus,  and  Diana.  Jupiter  rides  his  eagle <br/>as  the  symbol  of  his  sovereignty  over  the  world,  and  Juno  is  seated  upon  a  peacock,  the  proper  symbol  of  her  haughtiness <br/>and  glory. <br/><br/>P-  34 <br/><br/>oath  of  loyalty  upon  the  sacred  inscription.  Here  also  the  kings  donned  azure  robes  and  sat  in <br/>judgment.  At  daybreak  they  v^rote  their  sentences  upon  a  golden  tablet:  and  deposited  them  with <br/>their  robes  as  memorials.  The  chief  laws  of  the  Atlantean  kings  were  that  they  should  not  take  up <br/>arms  against  each  other  and  that  they  should  come  to  the  assistance  of  any  of  their  number  who  was <br/>attacked.  In  matters  of  war  and  great  moment  the  final  decision  was  in  the  hands  of  the  direct <br/>descendants  of  the  family  of  Atlas.  No  king  had  the  power  of  life  and  death  over  his  kinsmen  without <br/>the  assent  of  a  majority  of  the  ten. <br/><br/><br/>Plato  concludes  his  description  by  declaring  that  it  was  this  great  empire  which  attacked  the  Hellenic <br/><br/>states.  This  did  not  occur,  however,  until  their  power  and  glory  had  lured  the  Atlantean  kings  from <br/>the  pathway  of  wisdom  and  virtue.  Filled  with  false  ambition,  the  rulers  of  Atlantis  determined  to <br/>conquer  the  entire  world.  Zeus,  perceiving  the  wickedness  of  the  Atlanteans,  gathered  the  gods  into <br/>his  holy  habitation  and  addressed  them.  Here  Plato's  narrative  comes  to  an  abrupt  end,  for  the  Critias <br/>was  never  finished.  In  the  Timgeus  is  a  further  description  of  Atlantis,  supposedly  given  to  Solon  by  an <br/>Egyptian  priest  and  which  concludes  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;But  afterwards  there  occurred  violent  earthquakes  and  floods;  and  in  a  single  day  and  night  of  rain <br/>all  your  warlike  men  in  a  body  sank  into  the  earth,  and  the  island  of  Atlantis  in  like  manner <br/>disappeared,  and  was  sunk  beneath  the  sea.  And  that  is  the  reason  why  the  sea  in  those  parts  is <br/>impassable  and  impenetrable,  because  there  is  such  a  quantity  of  shallow  mud  in  the  way;  and  this <br/>was  caused  by  the  subsidence  of  the  island.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  introduction  to  his  translation  of  the  Timgeus,  Thomas  Taylor  quotes  from  a  History  of <br/>Ethiopia  written  by  Marcellus,  which  contains  the  following  reference  to  Atlantis:  &quot;For  they  relate <br/>that  in  their  time  there  were  seven  islands  in  the  Atlantic  sea,  sacred  to  Proserpine;  and  besides  these, <br/>three  others  of  an  immense  magnitude;  one  of  which  was  sacred  to  Pluto,  another  to  Ammon,  and <br/>another,  which  is  the  middle  of  these,  and  is  of  a  thousand  stadia,  to  Neptune.&quot;  Grantor,  commenting <br/>upon  Plato,  asserted  that  the  Egyptian  priests  declared  the  story  of  Atlantis  to  be  written  upon  pillars <br/>which  were  still  preserved  circa  300  B.C.  (See  Beginnings  or  Glimpses  of  Vanished  Civilizations.) <br/>Ignatius  Donnelly,  who  gave  the  subject  of  Atlantis  profound  study,  believed  that  horses  were  first <br/>domesticated  by  the  Atlanteans,  for  which  reason  they  have  always  been  considered  peculiarly  sacred <br/>to  Poseidon.  {See  Atlantis.) <br/><br/>From  a  careful  consideration  of  Plato's  description  of  Atlantis  it  is  evident  that  the  story  should  not  be <br/><br/>regarded  as  wholly  historical  but  rather  as  both  allegorical  and  historical.  Origen,  Porphyry,  Proclus, <br/>lamblichus,  and  Syrianus  realized  that  the  story  concealed  a  profound  philosophical  mystery,  but <br/>they  disagreed  as  to  the  actual  interpretation.  Plato's  Atlantis  symbolizes  the  threefold  nature  of  both <br/>the  universe  and  the  human  body.  The  ten  kings  of  Atlantis  are  the  tetractys,  or  numbers,  which  are <br/>born  as  five  pairs  of  opposites.  (Consult  Theon  of  Smyrna  for  the  Pythagorean  doctrine  of  opposites.) <br/>The  numbers  1  to  10  rule  every  creature,  and  the  numbers,  in  turn,  are  under  the  control  of  the <br/>Monad,  or  i~the  Eldest  among  them. <br/><br/>With  the  trident  scepter  of  Poseidon  these  kings  held  sway  over  the  inhabitants  of  the  seven  small  and <br/>three  great  islands  comprising  Atlantis.  Philosophically,  the  ten  islands  symbolize  the  triune  powers <br/>of  the  Superior  Deity  and  the  seven  regents  who  bow  before  His  eternal  throne.  If  Atlantis  be <br/>considered  as  the  archetypal  sphere,  then  its  immersion  signifies  the  descent  of  rational,  organized <br/>consciousness  into  the  illusionary,  impermanent  realm  of  irrational,  mortal  ignorance.  Both  the <br/>sinking  of  Atlantis  and  the  Biblical  story  of  the  &quot;fall  of  man&quot;  signify  spiritual  involution&#x2014;a <br/>prerequisite  to  conscious  evolution. <br/><br/>Either  the  initiated  Plato  used  the  Atlantis  allegory  to  achieve  two  widely  different  ends  or  else  the <br/>accounts  preserved  by  the  Egyptian  priests  were  tampered  with  to  perpetuate  the  secret  doctrine. <br/>This  does  not  mean  to  imply  that  Atlantis  is  purely  mythological,  but  it  overcomes  the  most  serious <br/>obstacle  to  acceptance  of  the  Atlantis  theory,  namely,  the  fantastic  accounts  of  its  origin,  size, <br/>appearance,  and  date  of  destruction~96oo  B.C.  In  the  midst  of  the  central  island  of  Atlantis  was  a <br/>lofty  mountain  which  cast  a  shadow  five  thousand  stadia  in  extent  and  whose  summit  touched  the <br/>sphere  of  aether.  This  is  the  axle  mountain  of  the  world,  sacred  among  many  races  and  symbolic  of  the <br/>human  head,  which  rises  out  of  the  four  elements  of  the  body.  This  sacred  mountain,  upon  whose <br/>summit  stood  the  temple  of  the  gods,  gave  rise  to  the  stories  of  Olympus,  Meru,  and  Asgard.  The  City <br/>of  the  Golden  Gates&#x2014;the  capital  of  Atlantis&#x2014; is  the  one  now  preserved  among  numerous  religions  as <br/><br/><br/>the  City  of  the  Gods  or  the  Holy  City.  Here  is  the  archetype  of  the  New  Jerusalem,  with  its  streets <br/>paved  with  gold  and  its  twelve  gates  shining  with  precious  stones. <br/><br/>&quot;The  history  of  Atlantis,&quot;  writes  Ignatius  Donnelly,  &quot;is  the  key  of  the  Greek  mythology.  There  can  be <br/>no  question  that  these  gods  of  Greece  were  human  beings.  The  tendency  to  attach  divine  attributes  to <br/>great  earthly  rulers  is  one  deeply  implanted  in  human  nature.&quot;  (See  Atlantis.) <br/><br/>The  same  author  sustains  his  views  by  noting  that  the  deities  of  the  Greek  pantheon  were  nor  looked <br/>upon  as  creators  of  the  universe  but  rather  as  regents  set  over  it  by  its  more  ancient  original <br/>fabricators.  The  Garden  of  Eden  from  which  humanity  was  driven  by  a  flaming  sword  is  perhaps  an <br/>allusion  to  the  earthly  paradise  supposedly  located  west  of  the  Pillars  of  Hercules  and  destroyed  by <br/>volcanic  cataclysms.  The  Deluge  legend  may  be  traced  also  to  the  Atlantean  inundation,  during  which <br/>a  &quot;world&quot;  was  destroyed  by  water.. <br/><br/>Was  the  religious,  philosophic,  and  scientific  knowledge  possessed  by  the  priestcrafts  of  antiquity <br/>secured  from  Atlantis,  whose  submergence  obliterated  every  vestige  of  its  part  in  the  drama  of  world <br/>progress?  Atlantean  sun  worship  has  been  perpetuated  in  the  ritualism  and  ceremonialism  of  both <br/>Christianity  and  pagandom.  Both  the  cross  and  the  serpent  were  Atlantean  emblems  of  divine <br/>wisdom.  The  divine  (Atlantean)  progenitors  of  the  Mayas  and  Quiches  of  Central  America  coexisted <br/>within  the  green  and  azure  radiance  of  Gucumatz,  the  &quot;plumed&quot;  serpent.  The  six  sky-born  sages  came <br/>into  manifestation  as  centers  of  light  bound  together  or  synthesized  by  the  seventh&#x2014;and  chief &#x2014;of <br/>their  order,  the  &quot;feathered&quot;  snake.  (See  the  Popol  Vuh.)  The  title  of  &quot;winged&quot;  or  &quot;plumed&quot;  snake  was <br/>applied  to  Quetzalcoatl,  or  Kukulcan,  the  Central  American  initiate.  The  center  of  the  Atlantean <br/>Wisdom-Religion  was  presumably  a  great  pyramidal  temple  standing  on  the  brow  of  a  plateau  rising <br/>in  the  midst  of  the  City  of  the  Golden  Gates.  From  here  the  Initiate-Priests  of  the  Sacred  Feather  went <br/>forth,  carrying  the  keys  of  Universal  Wisdom  to  the  uttermost  parts  of  the  earth. <br/><br/>The  mythologies  of  many  nations  contain  accounts  of  gods  who  &quot;came  out  of  the  sea.&quot;  Certain <br/>shamans  among  the  American  Indians  tell  of  holy  men  dressed  in  birds'  feathers  and  wampum  who <br/>rose  out  of  the  blue  waters  and  instructed  them  in  the  arts  and  crafts.  Among  the  legends  of  the <br/>Chaldeans  is  that  of  Cannes,  a  partly  amphibious  creature  who  came  out  of  the  sea  and  taught  the <br/>savage  peoples  along  the  shore  to  read  and  write,  till  the  soil,  cultivate  herbs  for  healing,  study  the <br/>stars,  establish  rational  forms  of  government,  and  become  conversant  with  the  sacred  Mysteries. <br/>Among  the  Mayas,  Quetzalcoatl,  the  Savior-God  (whom  some  Christian  scholars  believe  to  have  been <br/>St.  Thomas),  issued  from  the  waters  and,  after  instructing  the  people  in  the  essentials  of  civilization, <br/>rode  out  to  sea  on  a  magic  raft  of  serpents  to  escape  the  wrath  of  the  fierce  god  of  the  Fiery  Mirror, <br/>Tezcatlipoca. <br/><br/>May  it  not  have  been  that  these  demigods  of  a  fabulous  age  who,  Esdras-like,  came  out  of  the  sea  were <br/>Atlantean  priests?  All  that  primitive  man  remembered  of  the  Atlanteans  was  the  glory  of  their  golden <br/>ornaments,  the  transcendency  of  their  wisdom,  and  the  sanctity  of  their  symbols&#x2014;the  cross  and  the <br/>serpent.  That  they  came  in  ships  was  soon  forgotten,  for  untutored  minds  considered  even  boats  as <br/>supernatural.  Wherever  the  Atlanteans  proselyted  they  erected  pyramids  and  temples  patterned  after <br/>the  great  sanctuary  in  the  City  of  the  Golden  Gates.  Such  is  the  origin  of  the  pyramids  of  Egypt, <br/>Mexico,  and  Central  America.  The  mounds  in  Normandy  and  Britain,  as  well  as  those  of  the  American <br/>Indians,  are  remnants  of  a  similar  culture.  In  the  midst  of  the  Atlantean  program  of  world <br/>colonization  and  conversion,  the  cataclysms  which  sank  Atlantis  began.  The  Initiate-Priests  of  the <br/>Sacred  Feather  who  promised  to  come  back  to  their  missionary  settlements  never  returned;  and  after <br/>the  lapse  of  centuries  tradition  preserved  only  a  fantastic  account  of  gods  who  came  from  a  place <br/>where  the  sea  now  is. <br/><br/>H.  P.  Blavatsky  thus  sums  up  the  causes  which  precipitated  the  Atlantean  disaster:  &quot;Under  the  evil <br/>insinuations  of  their  demon,  Thevetat,  the  Atlantis-race  became  a  nation  of  wicked  magicians.  In <br/><br/><br/>consequence  of  this,  war  was  declared,  the  story  of  which  would  be  too  long  to  narrate;  its  substance <br/>maybe  found  in  the  disfigured  allegories  of  the  race  of  Cain,  the  giants,  and  that  of  Noah  and  his <br/>righteous  family.  The  conflict  came  to  an  end  by  the  submersion  of  the  Atlantis;  which  finds  its <br/>imitation  in  the  stories  of  the  Babylonian  and  Mosaic  flood:  The  giants  and  magicians  '*  *  *  and  all <br/>flesh  died  *  *  *  and  every  man.'  All  except  Xisuthrus  and  Noah,  who  are  substantially  identical  with <br/>the  great  Father  of  the  Thlinkithians  in  the  Popol  Vuh,  or  the  sacred  book  of  the  Guatemaleans,  which <br/>also  tells  of  his  escaping  in  a  large  boat,  like  the  Hindu  Noah&#x2014;Vaiswasvata. &quot;  (See  Isis  Unveiled.) <br/><br/>From  the  Atlanteans  the  world  has  received  not  only  the  heritage  of  arts  and  crafts,  philosophies  and <br/>sciences,  ethics  and  religions,  but  also  the  heritage  of  hate,  strife,  and  perversion.  The  Atlanteans <br/>instigated  the  first  war;  and  it  has  been  said  that  all  subsequent  wars  were  fought  in  a  fruitless  effort <br/>to  justify  the  first  one  and  right  the  wrong  which  it  caused.  Before  Atlantis  sank,  its  spiritually <br/>illumined  Initiates,  who  realized  that  their  land  was  doomed  because  it  had  departed  from  the  Path  of <br/>Light,  withdrew  from  the  ill-fated  continent.  Carrying  with  them  the  sacred  and  secret  doctrine,  these <br/>Atlanteans <br/><br/>P-  35 <br/><br/>established  themselves  in  Egypt,  where  they  became  its  first  &quot;divine&quot;  rulers.  Nearly  all  the  great <br/>cosmologic  myths  forming  the  foundation  of  the  various  sacred  books  of  the  world  are  based  upon  the <br/>Atlantean  Mystery  rituals. <br/><br/>THE  MYTH  OF  THE  DYING  GOD <br/><br/>The  mjith  of  Tammuz  and  Ishtar  is  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  the  dying-god  allegory,  probably <br/>antedating  4000  B.  C.  (See  Babylonia  and  Assyria  by  Lewis  Spence.)  The  imperfect  condition  of  the <br/>tablets  upon  which  the  legends  are  inscribed  makes  it  impossible  to  secure  more  than  a  fragmentary <br/>account  of  the  Tammuz  rites.  Being  the  esoteric  god  of  the  sun,  Tammuz  did  not  occupy  a  position <br/>among  the  first  deities  venerated  by  the  Babylonians,  who  for  lack  of  deeper  knowledge  looked  upon <br/>him  as  a  god  of  agriculture  or  a  vegetation  spirit.  Originally  he  was  described  as  being  one  of  the <br/>guardians  of  the  gates  of  the  underworld.  Like  many  other  Savior-Gods,  he  is  referred  to  as  a <br/>&quot;shepherd&quot;  or  &quot;the  lord  of  the  shepherd  seat.&quot;  Tammuz  occupies  the  remarkable  position  of  son  and <br/>husband  of  Ishtar,  the  Babylonian  and  Assyrian  Mother-goddess.  Ishtar~to  whom  the  planer  Venus <br/>was  sacred&#x2014;was  the  most  widely  venerated  deity  of  the  Babylonian  and  Assyrian  pantheon.  She  was <br/>probably  identical  with  Ashterorh,  Astarte,  and  Aphrodite.  The  story  of  her  descent  into  the <br/>underworld  in  search  presumably  for  the  sacred  elixir  which  alone  could  restore  Tammuz  to  life  is  the <br/>key  to  the  ritual  of  her  Mysteries.  Tammuz,  whose  annual  festival  took  place  just  before  the  summer <br/>solstice,  died  in  midsummer  in  the  ancient  month  which  bore  his  name,  and  was  mourned  with <br/>elaborate  ceremonies.  The  manner  of  his  death  is  unknown,  but  some  of  the  accusations  made  against <br/>Ishtar  by  Izdubar  (Nimrod)  would  indicate  that  she,  indirectly  at  least,  had  contributed  to  his  demise. <br/>The  resurrection  of  Tammuz  was  the  occasion  of  great  rejoicing,  at  which  time  he  was  hailed  as  a <br/>&quot;redeemer&quot;  of  his  people. <br/><br/>With  outspread  wings,  Ishtar,  the  daughter  of  Sin  (the  Moon),  sweeps  downward  to  the  gates  of  death. <br/>The  house  of  darkness&#x2014;the  dwelling  of  the  god  Irkalla&#x2014; is  described  as  &quot;the  place  of  no  return.&quot;  It  is <br/>without  light;  the  nourishment  of  those  who  dwell  therein  is  dust  and  their  food  is  mud.  Over  the <br/>bolts  on  the  door  of  the  house  of  Irkalla  is  scattered  dust,  and  the  keepers  of  the  house  are  covered <br/>with  feathers  like  birds.  Ishtar  demands  that  the  keepers  open  the  gates,  declaring  that  if  they  do  not <br/>she  will  shatter  the  doorposts  and  strike  the  hinges  and  raise  up  dead  devourers  of  the  living.  The <br/>guardians  of  the  gates  beg  her  to  be  patient  while  they  go  to  the  queen  of  Hades  from  whom  they <br/>secure  permission  to  admit  Ishtar,  but  only  in  the  same  manner  as  all  others  came  to  this  dreary <br/>house.  Ishtar  thereupon  descends  through  the  seven  gates  which  lead  downward  into  the  depths  of <br/>the  underworld.  At  the  first  gate  the  great  crown  is  removed  from  her  head,  at  the  second  gate  the <br/><br/><br/>earrings  from  her  ears,  at  the  third  gate  the  necklace  from  her  neck,  at  the  fourth  gate  the  ornaments <br/>from  her  breast,  at  the  fifth  gate  the  girdle  from  her  waist,  at  the  sixth  gate  the  bracelets  from  her <br/>hands  and  feet,  and  at  the  seventh  gate  the  covering  cloak  of  her  body.  Ishtar  remonstrates  as  each <br/>successive  article  of  apparel  is  taken  from  her,  bur  the  guardian  tells  her  that  this  is  the  experience  of <br/>all  who  enter  the  somber  domain  of  death.  Enraged  upon  beholding  Ishtar,  the  Mistress  of  Hades <br/>inflicts  upon  her  all  manner  of  disease  and  imprisons  her  in  the  underworld. <br/><br/>As  Ishtar  represents  the  spirit  of  fertility,  her  loss  prevents  the  ripening  of  the  crops  and  the  maturing <br/>of  all  life  upon  the  earth. <br/><br/>In  this  respect  the  story  parallels  the  legend  of  Persephone.  The  gods,  realizing  that  the  loss  of  Ishtar <br/>is  disorganizing  all  Nature,  send  a  messenger  to  the  underworld  and  demand  her  release.  The <br/>Mistress  of  Hades  is  forced  to  comply,  and  the  water  of  life  is  poured  over  Ishtar.  Thus  cured  of  the <br/>infirmities  inflicted  on  her,  she  retraces  her  way  upward  through  the  seven  gates,  at  each  of  which  she <br/>is  reinvested  with  the  article  of  apparel  which  the  guardians  had  removed.  (See  The  Chaldean <br/>Account  of  Genesis.)  No  record  exists  that  Ishtar  secured  the  water  of  life  which  would  have  wrought <br/>the  resurrection  of  Tammuz. <br/><br/>The  myth  of  Ishtar  symbolizes  the  descent  of  the  human  spirit  through  the  seven  worlds,  or  spheres  of <br/>the  sacred  planets,  until  finally,  deprived  of  its  spiritual  adornments,  it  incarnates  in  the  physical <br/>body~Hades~where  the  mistress  of  that  body  heaps  every  form  of  sorrow  and  misery  upon  the <br/>imprisoned  consciousness.  The  waters  of  life&#x2014;the  secret  doctrine&#x2014;cure  the  diseases  of  ignorance;  and <br/>the  spirit,  ascending  again  to  its  divine  source,  regains  its  God-given  adornments  as  it  passes  upward <br/>through  the  rings  of  the  planets. <br/><br/>Another  Mystery  ritual  among  the  Babylonians  and  Assyrians  was  that  of  Merodach  and  the  Dragon. <br/><br/>Merodach,  the  creator  of  the  inferior  universe,  slays  a  horrible  monster  and  out  of  her  body  forms  the <br/>universe.  Here  is  the  probable  source  of  the  so-called  Christian  allegory  of  St.  George  and  the  Dragon. <br/><br/>The  Mysteries  of  Adonis,  or  Adoni,  were  celebrated  annually  in  many  parts  of  Egypt,  Phcenicia,  and <br/>Biblos.  The  name  Adonis,  or  Adoni,  means  &quot;Lord&quot;  and  was  a  designation  applied  to  the  sun  and  later <br/>borrowed  by  the  Jews  as  the  exoteric  name  of  their  God.  Smyrna,  mother  of  Adonis,  was  turned  into  a <br/>tree  by  the  gods  and  after  a  time  the  bark  burst  open  and  the  infant  Savior  issued  forth.  According  to <br/>one  account,  he  was  liberated  by  a  wild  boar  which  split  the  wood  of  the  maternal  tree  with  its  tusks. <br/>Adonis  was  born  at  midnight  of  the  24th  of  December,  and  through  his  unhappy  death  a  Mystery  rite <br/>was  established  that  wrought  the  salvation  of  his  people.  In  the  Jewish  month  of  Tammuz  (another <br/>name  for  this  deity)  he  was  gored  to  death  by  a  wild  boar  sent  by  the  god  Ars  (Mars).  The  Adoniasmos <br/>was  the  ceremony  of  lamenting  the  premature  death  of  the  murdered  god. <br/><br/>In  Ezekiel  viii.  14,  it  is  written  that  women  were  weeping  for  Tammuz  (Adonis)  at  the  north  gate  of  the <br/>Lord's  House  in  Jerusalem.  Sir  James  George  Frazer  cites  Jerome  thus:  &quot;He  tells  us  that  Bethlehem, <br/>the  traditionary  birthplace  of  the  Lord,  was  shaded  by  a  grove  of  that  still  older  Syrian  Lord,  Adonis, <br/>and  that  where  the  infant  Jesus  had  wept,  the  lover  of  Venus  was  bewailed.&quot;  (See  The  Golden  Bough.) <br/>The  effigy  of  a  wild  boar  is  said  to  have  been  set  over  one  of  the  gates  of  Jerusalem  in  honor  of  Adonis, <br/>and  his  rites  celebrated  in  the  grotto  of  the  Nativity  at  Bethlehem.  Adonis  as  the  &quot;gored&quot;  (or  &quot;god&quot;) <br/>man  is  one  of  the  keys  to  Sir  Francis  Bacon's  use  of  the  &quot;wild  boar&quot;  in  his  cryptic  symbolism. <br/><br/>Adonis  was  originally  an  androgynous  deity  who  represented  the  solar  power  which  in  the  winter  was <br/>destroyed  by  the  evil  principle  of  cold&#x2014; the  boar.  After  three  days  (months)  in  the  tomb,  Adonis  rose <br/>triumphant  on  the  25th  day  of  March,  amidst  the  acclamation  of  his  priests  and  followers,  &quot;He  is <br/>risen!&quot;  Adonis  was  born  out  of  a  myrrh  tree.  Myrrh,  the  symbol  of  death  because  of  its  connection <br/>with  the  process  of  embalming,  was  one  of  the  gifts  brought  by  the  three  Magi  to  the  manger  of  Jesus. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  Mysteries  of  Adonis  the  neophyte  passed  through  the  symboUc  death  of  the  god  and,  &quot;raised&quot; <br/>by  the  priests,  entered  into  the  blessed  state  of  redemption  made  possible  by  the  sufferings  of  Adonis. <br/>Nearly  all  authors  believe  Adonis  to  have  been  originally  a  vegetation  god  directly  connected  with  the <br/>growth  and  maturing  of  flowers <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  CEdipusMgyptiacus. <br/><br/>The  great  Pan  was  celebrated  as  the  author  and  director  of  the  sacred  dances  which  he  is  supposed  to  have  instituted  to <br/>symboUze  the  circumambulations  of  the  heavenly  bodies.  Pan  was  a  composite  creature,  the  upper  part &#x2014;with  the <br/>exception  of  his  horns&#x2014;being  human,  and  the  lower  part  in  the  form  of  a  goat.  Pan  is  the  prototype  of  natural  energy  and, <br/>while  undoubtedly  a  phallic  deity,  should  nor  be  confused  with  Priapus.  The  pipes  of  Pan  signify  the  natural  harmony  of <br/>the  spheres,  and  the  god  himself  is  a  symbol  of  Saturn  because  this  planet  is  enthroned  in  Capricorn,  whose  emblem  is  a <br/>goat.  The  Eg)T)tians  were  initiated  into  the  Mysteries  of  Pan,  who  was  regarded  as  a  phase  of  Jupiter,  the  Demiurgus.  Pan <br/>represented  the  impregnating  power  of  the  sun  and  was  the  chief  of  a  horde  rustic  deities,  and  satyrs.  He  also  signified  the <br/>controlling  spirit  of  the  lower  worlds.  The  fabricated  a  story  to  the  effect  that  at  the  time  of  the  birth  of  Christ  the  oracles <br/>were  silenced  after  giving  utterance  to  one  last  cry,  &quot;Great  Pan  is  dead!&quot; <br/><br/>p-  36 <br/><br/>and  fruits.  In  support  of  this  viewpoint  they  describe  the  &quot;gardens  of  Adonis,  &quot;  which  were  small <br/>baskets  of  earth  in  which  seeds  were  planted  and  nurtured  for  a  period  of  eight  days.  When  those <br/>plants  prematurely  died  for  lack  of  sufficient  earth,  they  were  considered  emblematic  of  the  murdered <br/>Adonis  and  were  usually  cast  into  the  sea  with  images  of  the  god. <br/><br/>In  Phrygia  there  existed  a  remarkable  school  of  religious  philosophy  which  centered  around  the  life <br/>and  untimely  fate  of  another  Savior-God  known  as  Atys,  or  Attis,  by  many  considered  synonymous <br/><br/><br/>with  Adonis.  This  deity  was  born  at  midnight  on  the  24th  day  of  December.  Of  his  death  there  are  two <br/><br/>accounts.  In  one  he  was  gored  to  death  like  Adonis;  in  the  other  he  emasculated  himself  under  a  pine <br/>tree  and  there  died.  His  body  was  taken  to  a  cave  by  the  Great  Mother  (Cybele),  where  it  remained <br/>through  the  ages  without  decaying.  To  the  rites  of  Atys  the  modern  world  is  indebted  for  the <br/>symbolism  of  the  Christmas  tree.  Atys  imparted  his  immortality  to  the  tree  beneath  which  he  died, <br/>and  Cybele  took  the  tree  with  her  when  she  removed  the  body.  Atys  remained  three  days  in  the  tomb, <br/>rose  upon  a  date  corresponding  with  Easter  morn,  and  by  this  resurrection  overcame  death  for  all <br/>who  were  initiated  into  his  Mysteries. <br/><br/>&quot;In  the  Mysteries  of  the  Phrygians,  &quot;says  Julius  Firmicus,  &quot;which  are  called  those  of  the  MOTHER  OF <br/>THE  GODS,  every  year  a  PINE  TREE  is  cut  down  and  in  the  inside  of  the  tree  the  image  of  a  YOUTH <br/>is  tied  in!  In  the  Mysteries  of  Isis  the  trunk  of  a  PINE  TREE  is  cut:  the  middle  of  the  trunk  is  nicely <br/>hollowed  out;  the  idol  of  Osiris  made  from  those  hollowed  pieces  is  BURIED.  In  the  Mysteries  of <br/>Proserpine  a  tree  cut  is  put  together  into  the  effigy  and  form  of  the  VIRGIN,  and  when  it  has  been <br/>carried  within  the  city  it  is  MOURNED  40  nights,  but  the  fortieth  night  it  is  BURNED!&quot;  (See  Sod,  the <br/>Mysteries  ofAdoni.) <br/><br/>The  Mysteries  of  Atys  included  a  sacramental  meal  during  which  the  neophyte  ate  out  of  a  drum  and <br/>drank  from  a  cymbal.  After  being  baptized  by  the  blood  of  a  bull,  the  new  initiate  was  fed  entirely  on <br/>milk  to  symbolize  that  he  was  still  a  philosophical  infant,  having  but  recently  been  born  out  of  the <br/>sphere  of  materiality.  (See  Frazer's  The  Golden  Bough.)  Is  there  a  possible  connection  between  this <br/>lacteal  diet  prescribed  by  the  Attic  rite  and  St.  Paul's  allusion  to  the  food  for  spiritual  babes?  Sallust <br/>gives  a  key  to  the  esoteric  interpretation  of  the  Attic  rituals.  Cybele,  the  Great  Mother,  signifies  the <br/>vivifying  powers  of  the  universe,  and  Atys  that  aspect  of  the  spiritual  intellect  which  is  suspended <br/>between  the  divine  and  animal  spheres.  The  Mother  of  the  gods,  loving  Atys,  gave  him  a  starry  hat, <br/>signifying  celestial  powers,  but  Atys  (mankind),  falling  in  love  with  a  nymph  (symbolic  of  the  lower <br/>animal  propensities),  forfeited  his  divinity  and  lost  his  creative  powers.  It  is  thus  evident  that  Atys <br/>represents  the  human  consciousness  and  that  his  Mysteries  are  concerned  with  the  reattainment  of <br/>the  starry  hat.  (See  Sallust  on  the  Gods  and  the  World.) <br/><br/>The  rites  of  Sabazius  were  very  similar  to  those  of  Bacchus  and  it  is  generally  believed  that  the  two <br/>deities  are  identical.  Bacchus  was  born  at  Sabazius,  or  Sabaoth,  and  these  names  are  frequently <br/>assigned  to  him.  The  Sabazian  Mysteries  were  performed  at  night,  and  the  ritual  included  the  drawing <br/>of  a  live  snake  across  the  breast  of  the  candidate.  Clement  of  Alexandria  writes:  &quot;The  token  of  the <br/>Sabazian  Mysteries  to  the  initiated  is  'the  deity  gliding  over  the  breast.'&quot;  A  golden  serpent  was  the <br/>symbol  of  Sabazius  because  this  deity  represented  the  annual  renovation  of  the  world  by  the  solar <br/>power.  The  Jews  borrowed  the  name  Sabaoth  from  these  Mysteries  and  adopted  it  as  one  of  the <br/>appellations  of  their  supreme  God.  During  the  time  the  Sabazian  Mysteries  were  celebrated  in  Rome, <br/>the  cult  gained  many  votaries  and  later  influenced  the  symbolism  of  Christianity. <br/><br/>The  Cabiric  Mysteries  of  Samothrace  were  renowned  among  the  ancients,  being  next  to  the <br/>Eleusinian  in  public  esteem.  Herodotus  declares  that  the  Samothracians  received  their  doctrines, <br/>especially  those  concerning  Mercury,  from  the  Pelasgians.  Little  is  known  concerning  the  Cabiric <br/>rituals,  for  they  were  enshrouded  in  the  profoundest  secrecy.  Some  regard  the  Cabiri  as  seven  in <br/>number  and  refer  to  them  as  &quot;the  Seven  Spirits  of  fire  before  the  throne  of  Saturn.&quot;  Others  believe  the <br/>Cabiri  to  be  the  seven  sacred  wanderers,  later  called  the  planets. <br/><br/>While  a  vast  number  of  deities  are  associated  with  the  Samothracian  Mysteries,  the  ritualistic  drama <br/>centers  around  four  brothers.  The  first  three&#x2014;Aschieros,  Achiochersus,  and  Achiochersa&#x2014;attack  and <br/>murder  the  fourth&#x2014;Cashmala  (or  Cadmillus).  Dionysidorus,  however,  identifies  Aschieros  with <br/>Demeter,  Achiochersus  with  Pluto,  Achiochersa  with  Persephone,  and  Cashmala  with  Hermes. <br/>Alexander  Wilder  notes  that  in  the  Samothracian  ritual  &quot;Cadmillus  is  made  to  include  the  Theban <br/>Serpent-god,  Cadmus,  the  Thoth  of  Egypt,  the  Hermes  of  the  Greeks,  and  the  Emeph  or  ^sculapius <br/><br/><br/>of  the  Alexandrians  and  Phoenicians.  &quot;  Here  again  is  a  repetition  of  the  story  of  Osiris,  Bacchus, <br/>Adonis,  Balder,  and  Hiram  Abiff.  The  worship  of  Atys  and  Cybele  was  also  involved  in  the <br/>Samothracian  Mysteries.  In  the  rituals  of  the  Cabiri  is  to  be  traced  a  form  of  pine-tree  worship,  for <br/>this  tree,  sacred  to  Atys,  was  first  trimmed  into  the  form  of  a  cross  and  then  cut  down  in  honor  of  the <br/>murdered  god  whose  body  was  discovered  at  its  foot. <br/><br/>&quot;If  you  wish  to  inspect  the  orgies  of  the  Corybantes, &quot;  writes  Clement,  &quot;Then  know  that,  having  killed <br/>their  third  brother,  they  covered  the  head  of  the  dead  body  with  a  purple  cloth,  crowned  it,  and <br/>carrying  it  on  the  point  of  a  spear,  buried  it  under  the  roots  of  Olympus.  These  mysteries  are,  in  short, <br/>murders  and  funerals.  [This  ante-Nicene  Father  in  his  efforts  to  defame  the  pagan  rites  apparently <br/>ignores  the  fact  that,  like  the  Cabirian  martyr,  Jesus  Christ  was  foully  betrayed,  tortured,  and  finally <br/>murdered!]  And  the  priests  Of  these  rites,  who  are  called  kings  of  the  sacred  rites  by  those  whose <br/>business  it  is  to  name  them,  give  additional  strangeness  to  the  tragic  occurrence,  by  forbidding <br/>parsley  with  the  roots  from  being  placed  on  the  table,  for  they  think  that  parsley  grew  from  the <br/>Corybantic  blood  that  flowed  forth;  just  as  the  women,  in  celebrating  the  Thcsmophoria,  abstain  from <br/>eating  the  seeds  of  the  pomegranate,  which  have  fallen  on  the  ground,  from  the  idea  that <br/>pomegranates  sprang  from  the  drops  of  the  blood  of  Dionysus.  Those  Corybantes  also  they  call <br/>Cabiric;  and  the  ceremony  itself  they  announce  as  the  Cabiric  mystery.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Mysteries  of  the  Cabiri  were  divided  into  three  degrees,  the  first  of  which  celebrated  the  death  of <br/>Cashmala,  at  the  hands  of  his  three  brothers;  the  second,  the  discovery  of  his  mutilated  body,  the <br/>parts  of  which  had  been  found  and  gathered  after  much  labor;  and  the  third&#x2014;accompanied  by  great <br/>rejoicing  and  happiness&#x2014; his  resurrection  and  the  consequent  salvation  of  the  world.  The  temple  of <br/>the  Cabiri  at  Samothrace  contained  a  number  of  curious  divinities,  many  of  them  misshapen <br/>creatures  representing  the  elemental  powers  of  Nature,  possibly  the  Bacchic  Titans.  Children  were <br/>initiated  into  the  Cabirian  cult  with  the  same  dignity  as  adults,  and  criminals  who  reached  the <br/>sanctuary  were  safe  from  pursuit.  The  Samothracian  rites  were  particularly  concerned  with <br/>navigation,  the  Dioscuri&#x2014; Castor  and  Pollux,  or  the  gods  of  navigation&#x2014; being  among  those  propitiated <br/>by  members  of  that  cult.  The  Argonautic  expedition,  listening  to  the  advice  of  Orpheus,  stopped  at  the <br/>island  of  Samothrace  for  the  purpose  of  having  its  members  initiated  into  the  Cabiric  rites. <br/><br/>Herodotus  relates  that  when  Cambyses  entered  the  temple  of  the  Cabiri  he  was  unable  to  restrain  his <br/>mirth  at  seeing  before  him  the  figure  of  a  man  standing  upright  and,  facing  the  man,  the  figure  of  a <br/>woman  standing  on  her  head.  Had  Cambyses  been  acquainted  with  the  principles  of  divine <br/>astronomy,  he  would  have  realized  that  he  was  then  in  the  presence  of  the  key  to  universal <br/>equilibrium.  &quot;T  ask,'  says  Voltaire,  'who  were  these  Hierophants,  these  sacred  Freemasons,  who <br/>celebrated  their  Ancient  Mysteries  of  Samothracia,  and  whence  came  they  and  their  gods  Cabiri?'&quot; <br/>(See  Mackey's  Encyclopaedia  of  Freemasonry.)  Clement  speaks  of  the  Mysteries  of  the  Cabiri  as  &quot;the <br/>sacred  Mystery  of  a  brother  slain  by  his  brethren,&quot;  and  the  &quot;Cabiric  death&quot;  was  one  of  the  secret <br/>symbols  of  antiquity.  Thus  the  allegory  of  the  Self  murdered  by  the  not-self  is  perpetuated  through <br/>the  religious  mysticism  of  all  peoples.  The  philosophic  death  and  the  philosophic  resurrection  are  the <br/>Lesser  and  the  Greater  Mysteries  respectively. <br/><br/>A  curious  aspect  of  the  dying-god  myth  is  that  of  the  Hanged  Man.  The  most  important  example  of <br/>this  peculiar  conception  is  found  in  the  Odinic  rituals  where  Odin  hangs  himself  for  nine  nights  from <br/>the  branches  of  the  World  Tree  and  upon  the  same  occasion  also  pierces  his  own  side  with  the  sacred <br/>spear.  As  the  result  of  this  great  sacrifice,  Odin,  while  suspended  over  the  depths  of  Nifl-heim, <br/>discovered  by  meditation  the  runes  or  alphabets  by  which  later  the  records  of  his  people  were <br/>preserved.  Because  of  this  remarkable  experience,  Odin  is  sometimes  shown  seated  on  a  gallows  tree <br/>and  he  became  the  patron  deity  of  all  who  died  by  the  noose.  Esoterically,  the  Hanged  Man  is  the <br/>human  spirit  which  is  suspended  from  heaven  by  a  single  thread.  Wisdom,  not  death,  is  the  reward <br/>for  this  voluntary  sacrifice  during  which  the  human  soul,  suspended  above  the  world  of  illusion,  and <br/>meditating  upon  its  unreality,  is  rewarded  by  the  achievement  of  self-realization. <br/><br/><br/>From  a  consideration  of  all  these  ancient  and  secret  rituals  it  becomes  evident  that  the  mystery  of  the <br/>dying  god  was  universal  among  the  illumined  and  venerated  colleges  of  the  sacred  teaching.  This <br/>mystery  has  been  perpetuated  in  Christianity  in  the  crucifixion  and  death  of  the  God-man-Jesus  the <br/>Christ.  The  secret  import  of  this  world  tragedy  and  the  Universal  Martyr  must  be  rediscovered  if <br/>Christianity  is  to  reach  the  heights  attained  by  the  pagans  in  the  days  of  their  philosophic  supremacy. <br/>The  myth  of  the  dying  god  is  the  key  to  both  universal  and  individual  redemption  and  regeneration, <br/>and  those  who  do  not  comprehend  the  true  nature  of  this  supreme  allegory  are  not  privileged  to <br/>consider  themselves  either  wise  or  truly  religious. <br/><br/><br/>P-  37 <br/><br/><br/>The  Life  and  Teachings  of  Thoth  Hermes <br/><br/>Trismegistus <br/><br/>THUNDER  rolled,  lightning  flashed,  the  veil  of  the  Temple  was  rent  from  top  to  bottom.  The <br/>venerable  initiator,  in  his  robes  of  blue  and  gold,  slowly  raised  his  jeweled  wand  and  pointed  with  it <br/>into  the  darkness  revealed  by  the  tearing  of  the  silken  curtain:  &quot;Behold  the  Light  of  Egypt! &quot;  The <br/>candidate,  in  his  plain  white  robe,  gazed  into  the  utter  blackness  framed  by  the  two  great  Lotus- <br/>headed  columns  between  which  the  veil  had  hung.  As  he  watched,  a  luminous  haze  distributed  itself <br/>throughout  the  atmosphere  until  the  air  was  a  mass  of  shining  particles.  The  face  of  the  neophyte <br/>was  illumined  by  the  soft  glow  as  he  scanned  the  shimmering  cloud  for  some  tangible  object.  The <br/>initiator  spoke  again:  &quot;This  Light  which  ye  behold  is  the  secret  luminance  of  the  Mysteries.  Whence <br/>it  comes  none  knoweth,  save  the  'Master  of  the  Light. '  Behold  Him!&quot;  Suddenly,  through  the  gleaming <br/>mist  a  figure  appeared,  surrounded  by  a  flickering  greenish  sheen.  The  initiator  lowered  his  wand <br/>and,  bowing  his  head,  placed  one  hand  edgewise  against  his  breast  in  humble  salutation.  The <br/>neophyte  stepped  back  in  awe,  partly  blinded  by  the  glory  of  the  revealed  figure.  Gaining  courage, <br/>the  youth  gazed  again  at  the  Divine  One.  The  Form  before  him  was  considerably  larger  than  that  of <br/>a  mortal  man.  The  body  seemed  partly  transparent  so  that  the  heart  and  brain  could  be  seen <br/>pulsating  and  radiant.  As  the  candidate  watched,  the  heart  changed  into  an  ibis,  and  the  brain  into <br/>a  fiashing  emerald.  In  Its  hand  this  mysterious  Being  bore  a  winged  rod,  entwined  with  serpents. <br/>The  aged  initiator,  raising  his  wand,  cried  out  in  a  loud  voice:  &quot;All  hail  Thee,  Thoth  Hermes,  Thrice <br/>Greatest;  all  hail  Thee,  Prince  of  Men;  all  hail  Thee  who  standeth  upon  the  head  ofTyphon!&quot;At  the <br/>same  instant  a  lurid  writhing  dragon  appeared&#x2014; a  hideous  monster,  part  serpent,  part  crocodile, <br/>and  part  hog.  From  its  mouth  and  nostrils  poured  sheets  offiame  and  horrible  sounds  echoed <br/>through  the  vaulted  chambers.  Suddenly  Hermes  struck  the  advancing  reptile  with  the  serpent- <br/>wound  staff  and  with  snarling  cry  the  dragon  fell  over  upon  its  side,  while  the  fiames  about  it <br/>slowly  died  away.  Hermes  placed  His  foot  upon  the  skull  of  the  vanquished  Typhon.  The  next <br/>instant,  with  a  blaze  of  unbearable  glory  that  sent  the  neophyte  staggering  backward  against  a <br/>pillar,  the  immortal  Hermes,  followed  by  streamers  of  greenish  mist,  passed  through  the  chamber <br/>and  faded  into  nothingness. <br/><br/>SUPPOSITIONS  CONCERNING  THE  IDENTITY  OF  HERMES <br/><br/>lamblichus  averred  that  Hermes  was  the  author  of  twenty  thousand  books;  Manetho  increased  the <br/>number  to  more  than  thirty-six  thousand  (see  James  Gardner) &#x2014;figures  which  make  it  evident  that  a <br/>soHtary  individual,  even  though  he  be  overshadowed  by  divine  prerogative,  could  scarcely  have <br/>accomplished  such  a  monumental  labor.  Among  the  arts  and  sciences  which  it  is  affirmed  Hermes <br/>revealed  to  mankind  were  medicine,  chemistry,  law,  arc,  astrology,  music,  rhetoric.  Magic,  philosophy, <br/>geography,  mathematics  (especially  geometry),  anatomy,  and  oratory.  Orpheus  was  similarly <br/>acclaimed  by  the  Greeks. <br/><br/>In  his  Biographia  Antiqua,  Francis  Barrett  says  of  Hermes:  &quot;*  *  *  if  God  ever  appeared  in  man,  he <br/>appeared  in  him,  as  is  evident  both  from  his  books  and  his  Pymander;  in  which  works  he  has <br/><br/>communicated  the  sum  of  the  Abyss,  and  the  divine  knowledge  to  all  posterity;  by  which  he  has <br/>demonstrated  himself  to  have  been  not  only  an  inspired  divine,  but  also  a  deep  philosopher, <br/>obtaining  his  wisdom  from  God  and  heavenly  things,  and  not  from  man.&quot; <br/><br/>His  transcendent  learning  caused  Hermes  to  be  identified  with  many  of  the  early  sages  and  prophets. <br/>In  his  Ancient  Mythology,  Bryant  writes:  &quot;I  have  mentioned  that  Cadmus  was  the  same  as  the <br/>Egyptian  Thoth;  and  it  is  manifest  from  his  being  Hermes,  and  from  the  invention  of  letters  being <br/><br/><br/>attributed  to  him.  &quot;  (In  the  chapter  on  the  theory  of  Pythagorean  Mathematics  will  be  found  the  table <br/>of  the  original  Cadmean  letters.)  Investigators  believe  that  it  was  Hermes  who  was  known  to  the  Jews <br/>as  &quot;Enoch,&quot;  called  by  Kenealy  the  &quot;Second  Messenger  of  God.&quot;  Hermes  was  accepted  into  the <br/>mythology  of  the  Greeks,  later  becoming  the  Mercury  of  the  Latins.  He  was  revered  through  the  form <br/>of  the  planet  Mercury  because  this  body  is  nearest  to  the  sun:  Hermes  of  all  creatures  was  nearest  to <br/>God,  and  became  known  as  the  Messenger  of  the  Gods. <br/><br/>In  the  Egyptian  drawings  of  him,  Thoth  carries  a  waxen  writing  tablet  and  serves  as  the  recorder <br/>during  the  weighing  of  the  souls  of  the  dead  in  the  judgment  Hall  of  Osiris~a  ritual  of  great <br/>significance.  Hermes  is  of  first  importance  to  Masonic  scholars,  because  he  was  the  author  of  the <br/>Masonic  initiatory  rituals,  which  were  borrowed  from  the  Mysteries  established  by  Hermes.  Nearly  all <br/>of  the  Masonic  symbols  are  Hermetic  in  character.  Pythagoras  studied  mathematics  with  the <br/>Egyptians  and  from  them  gained  his  knowledge  of  the  symbolic  geometric  solids.  Hermes  is  also <br/>revered  for  his  reformation  of  the  calendar  system.  He  increased  the  year  from  360  to  365  days,  thus <br/>establishing  a  precedent  which  still  prevails.  The  appellation  &quot;Thrice  Greatest&quot;  was  given  to  Hermes <br/>because  he  was  considered  the  greatest  of  all  philosophers,  the  greatest  of  all  priests,  and  the  greatest <br/>of  all  kings.  It  is  worthy  of  note  that  the  last  poem  of  America's  beloved  poet,  Henry  Wadsworth <br/>Longfellow,  was  a  lyric  ode  to  Hermes.  (See  Chambers'  Encyclopaedia.) <br/><br/>THE  MUTILATED  HERMETIC  FRAGMENTS <br/><br/>On  the  subject  of  the  Hermetic  books,  James  Campbell  Brown,  in  his  History  of  Chemistry,  has <br/>written:  &quot;Leaving  the  Chaldean  and  earliest  Egyptian  periods,  of  which  we  have  remains  but  no <br/>record,  and  from  which  no  names  of  either  chemists  or  philosophers  have  come  down  to  us,  we  now <br/>approach  the  Historic  Period,  when  books  were  written,  not  at  first  upon  parchment  or  paper,  but <br/>upon  papyrus.  A  series  of  early  Egyptian  books  is  attributed  to  Hermes  Trismegistus,  who  may  have <br/>been  a  real  savant,  or  may  be  a  personification  of  a  long  succession  of  writers.  *  *  *  He  is  identified  by <br/>some  with  the  Greek  god  Hermes,  and  the  Egyptian  Thoth  or  Tuti,  who  was  the  moon-god,  and  is <br/>represented  in  ancient  paintings  as  ibis-headed  with  the  disc  and  crescent  of  the  moon.  The  Egyptians <br/>regarded  him  as  the  god  of  wisdom,  letters,  and  the  recording  of  time.  It  is  in  consequence  of  the <br/>great  respect  entertained  for  Hermes  by  the  old  alchemists  that  chemical  writings  were  called <br/>'hermetic,'  and  that  the  phrase  'hermetically  sealed'  is  still  in  use  to  designate  the  closing  of  a  glass <br/>vessel  by  fusion,  after  the  manner  of  chemical  manipulators.  We  find  the  same  root  in  the  hermetic <br/>medicines  of  Paracelsus,  and  the  hermetic  freemasonry  of  the  Middle  Ages.&quot; <br/><br/>Among  the  fragmentary  writings  believed  to  have  come  from  the  stylus  of  Hermes  are  two  famous <br/>works.  The  first  is  the  Emerald  Table,  and  the  second  is  the  Divine  Pymander,  or,  as  it  is  more <br/>commonly  called.  The  Shepherd  of  Men,  a  discussion  of  which  follows.  One  outstanding  point  in <br/>connection  with  Hermes  is  that  he  was  one  of  the  few  philosopher-priests  of  pagandom  upon  whom <br/>the  early  Christians  did  not  vent  their  spleen.  Some  Church  Fathers  went  so  far  as  to  declare  that <br/>Hermes  exhibited  many  symptoms  of  intelligence,  and  that  if  he  had  only  been  born  in  a  more <br/>enlightened  age  so  that  he  might  have  benefited  by  their  instructions  he  would  have  been  a  really <br/>great  man! <br/><br/>In  his  Stromata,  Clement  of  Alexandria,  one  of  the  few  chroniclers  of  pagan  lore  whose  writings  have <br/>been  preserved  to  this  age,  gives  practically  all  the  information  that  is  known  concerning  the  original <br/>forty-two  books  of  Hermes  and  the  importance  with  which  these  books  were  regarded  by  both  the <br/>temporal  and  spiritual  powers  of  Egypt.  Clement  describes  one  of  their  ceremonial  processions  as <br/>follows: <br/><br/>&quot;For  the  Egyptians  pursue  a  philosophy  of  their  own.  This  is <br/><br/><br/>HERMES  MERCURIUS  TRISMEGISTUS. <br/><br/>From  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>Master  of  all  arts  and  sciences,  perfect  in  all  crafts,  Ruler  of  the  Three  Worlds,  Scribe  of  the  Gods,  and  Keeper  of  the  Books <br/>of  Life,  Thoth  Hermes  Trismegistus~the  Three  Times  Greatest,  the  &quot;First  Intelligencer&quot;~was  regarded  by  the  ancient <br/>Egyptians  as  the  embodiment  of  the  Universal  Mind.  While  in  all  probability  there  actually  existed  a  great  sage  and <br/>educator  by  the  name  of  Hermes,  it  is  impossible  to  extricate  the  historical  man  from  the  mass  of  legendary  accounts <br/>which  attempt  to  identify  him  with  the  Cosmic  Principle  of  Thought. <br/><br/>p.  38 <br/><br/>principally  shown  by  their  sacred  ceremonial.  For  first  advances  the  Singer,  bearing  some  one  of  the <br/>symbols  of  music.  For  they  say  that  he  must  learn  two  of  the  books  of  Hermes,  the  one  of  which <br/>contains  the  hymns  of  the  gods,  the  second  the  regulations  for  the  king's  life.  And  after  the  Singer <br/>advances  the  Astrologer,  with  a  horologe  in  his  hand,  and  a  palm,  the  symbols  of  astrology.  He  must <br/>have  the  astrological  books  of  Hermes,  which  are  four  in  number,  always  in  his  mouth.  Of  these,  one <br/>is  about  the  order  of  the  fixed  stars  that  are  visible,  and  another  about  the  conjunctions  and  luminous <br/>appearances  of  the  sun  and  moon;  and  the  rest  respecting  their  risings.  Next  in  order  advances  the <br/>sacred  Scribe,  with  wings  on  his  head,  and  in  his  hand  a  book  and  rule,  in  which  were  writing  ink  and <br/>the  reed,  with  which  they  write.  And  he  must  be  acquainted  with  what  are  called  hieroglyphics,  and <br/>know  about  cosmography  and  geography,  the  position  of  the  sun  and  moon,  and  about  the  five <br/>planets;  also  the  description  of  Egypt,  and  the  chart  of  the  Nile;  and  the  description  of  the  equipment <br/>of  the  priests  and  of  the  place  consecrated  to  them,  and  about  the  measures  and  the  things  in  use  in <br/>the  sacred  rites.  Then  the  Stole-keeper  follows  those  previously  mentioned,  with  the  cubit  of  justice <br/>and  the  cup  for  libations.  He  is  acquainted  with  all  points  called  Pgedeutic  (relating  to  training)  and <br/>Moschophaltic  (sacrificial).  There  are  also  ten  books  which  relate  to  the  honour  paid  by  them  to  their <br/>gods,  and  containing  the  Egyptian  worship;  as  that  relating  to  sacrifices,  first-fruits,  hymns,  prayers, <br/>processions,  festivals,  and  the  like.  And  behind  all  walks  the  Prophet,  with  the  water-vase  carried <br/>openly  in  his  arms;  who  is  followed  by  those  who  carry  the  issue  of  loaves.  He,  as  being  the  governor <br/>of  the  temple,  learns  the  ten  books  called  'Hieratic';  and  they  contain  all  about  the  laws,  and  the  gods, <br/>and  the  whole  of  the  training  of  the  priests.  For  the  Prophet  is,  among  the  Egyptians,  also  over  the <br/>distribution  of  the  revenues.  There  are  then  forty-two  books  of  Hermes  indispensably  necessary;  of <br/><br/><br/>which  the  six-and-thirty  containing  the  whole  philosophy  of  the  Egyptians  are  learned  by  the <br/><br/>forementioned  personages;  and  the  other  six,  which  are  medical,  by  the  Pastophoroi  (image- <br/>bearers), &#x2014;treating  of  the  structure  of  the  body,  and  of  disease,  and  instruments,  and  medicines,  and <br/>about  the  eyes,  and  the  last  about  women. <br/><br/>One  of  the  greatest  tragedies  of  the  philosophic  world  was  the  loss  of  nearly  all  of  the  forty-two  books <br/>of  Hermes  mentioned  in  the  foregoing.  These  books  disappeared  during  the  burning  of  Alexandria, <br/>for  the  Romans&#x2014;and  later  the  Christians&#x2014; realized  that  until  these  books  were  eliminated  they  could <br/>never  bring  the  Egyptians  into  subjection.  The  volumes  which  escaped  the  fire  were  buried  in  the <br/>desert  and  their  location  is  now  known  to  only  a  few  initiates  of  the  secret  schools. <br/><br/>THE  BOOK  OF  THOTH <br/><br/>While  Hermes  still  walked  the  earth  with  men,  he  entrusted  to  his  chosen  successors  the  sacred  Book <br/>ofThoth.  This  work  contained  the  secret  processes  by  which  the  regeneration  of  humanity  was  to  be <br/>accomplished  and  also  served  as  the  key  to  his  other  writings.  Nothing  definite  is  known  concerning <br/>the  contents  of  the  Book  ofThoth  other  than  that  its  pages  were  covered  with  strange  hieroglyphic <br/>figures  and  symbols,  which  gave  to  those  acquainted  with  their  use  unlimited  power  over  the  spirits  of <br/>the  air  and  the  subterranean  divinities.  When  certain  areas  of  the  brain  are  stimulated  by  the  secret <br/>processes  of  the  Mysteries,  the  consciousness  of  man  is  extended  and  he  is  permitted  to  behold  the <br/>Immortals  and  enter  into  the  presence  of  the  superior  gods.  The  Book  ofThoth  described  the  method <br/>whereby  this  stimulation  was  accomplished.  In  truth,  therefore,  it  was  the  &quot;Key  to  Immortality.&quot; <br/><br/>According  to  legend,  the  Book  ofThoth  was  kept  in  a  golden  box  in  the  inner  sanctuary  of  the  temple. <br/>There  was  but  one  key  and  this  was  in  the  possession  of  the  &quot;Master  of  the  Mysteries,&quot;  the  highest <br/>initiate  of  the  Hermetic  Arcanum.  He  alone  knew  what  was  written  in  the  secret  book.  The  Book  of <br/>Thoth  was  lost  to  the  ancient  world  with  the  decay  of  the  Mysteries,  but  its  faithful  initiates  carried  it <br/>sealed  in  the  sacred  casket  into  another  land.  The  book  is  still  in  existence  and  continues  to  lead  the <br/>disciples  of  this  age  into  the  presence  of  the  Immortals.  No  other  information  can  be  given  to  the <br/>world  concerning  it  now,  but  the  apostolic  succession  from  the  first  hierophant  initiated  by  Hermes <br/>himself  remains  unbroken  to  this  day,  and  those  who  are  peculiarly  fitted  to  serve  the  Immortals  may <br/>discover  this  priceless  document  if  they  will  search  sincerely  and  tirelessly  for  it. <br/><br/>It  has  been  asserted  that  the  Book  ofThoth  is,  in  reality,  the  mysterious  Tarot  of  the  Bohemians&#x2014; a <br/>strange  emblematic  book  of  seventy-eight  leaves  which  has  been  in  possession  of  the  gypsies  since  the <br/>time  when  they  were  driven  from  their  ancient  temple,  the  Serapeum.  (According  to  the  Secret <br/>Histories  the  gypsies  were  originally  Egyptian  priests.)  There  are  now  in  the  world  several  secret <br/>schools  privileged  to  initiate  candidates  into  the  Mysteries,  but  in  nearly  every  instance  they  lighted <br/>their  altar  fires  from  the  flaming  torch  of  Herm.  Hermes  in  his  Book  ofThoth  revealed  to  all  mankind <br/>the  &quot;One  Way,&quot;  and  for  ages  the  wise  of  every  nation  and  every  faith  have  reached  immortality  by  the <br/>&quot;Way&quot;  established  by  Hermes  in  the  midst  of  the  darkness  for  the  redemption  of  humankind. <br/><br/>POIMANDRES,  THE  VISION  OF  HERMES <br/><br/>The  Divine  Pymander  of  Hermes  Mercurius  Trismegistus  is  one  of  the  earliest  of  the  Hermetic <br/>writings  now  extant.  While  probably  not  in  its  original  form,  having  been  remodeled  during  the  first <br/>centuries  of  the  Christian  Era  and  incorrectly  translated  since,  this  work  undoubtedly  contains  many <br/>of  the  original  concepts  of  the  Hermetic  cultus.  The  Divine  Pymander  consists  of  seventeen <br/>fragmentary  writings  gathered  together  and  put  forth  as  one  work.  The  second  book  of  The  Divine <br/>Pymander,  called  Poimandres,  or  The  Vision,  is  believed  to  describe  the  method  by  which  the  divine <br/>wisdom  was  first  revealed  to  Hermes.  It  was  after  Hermes  had  received  this  revelation  that  he  began <br/><br/><br/>his  ministry,  teaching  to  all  who  would  listen  the  secrets  of  the  invisible  universe  as  they  had  been <br/>unfolded  to  him. <br/><br/>The  Vision  is  the  most:  famous  of  all  the  Hermetic  fragments,  and  contains  an  exposition  of  Hermetic <br/>cosmogony  and  the  secret  sciences  of  the  Egyptians  regarding  the  culture  and  unfoldment  of  the <br/>human  soul.  For  some  time  it  was  erroneously  called  &quot;The  Genesis  of  Enoch,&quot;  but  that  mistake  has <br/>now  been  rectified.  At  hand  while  preparing  the  following  interpretation  of  the  symbolic  philosophy <br/>concealed  within  The  Vision  of  Hermes  the  present  author  has  had  these  reference  works:  The  Divine <br/>Pymander  of  Hermes  Mercurius  Trismegistus  (London,  1650),  translated  out  of  the  Arabic  and <br/>Greek  by  Dr.  Everard;  Hermetica  (Oxford,  1924),  edited  by  Walter  Scott;  Hermes,  The  Mysteries  of <br/>Egypt  (Philadelphia,  1925),  by  Edouard  Schure;  and  the  Thrice-Greatest  Hermes  (London,  1906),  by <br/>G.  R.  S.  Mead.  To  the  material  contained  in  the  above  volumes  he  has  added  commentaries  based <br/>upon  the  esoteric  philosophy  of  the  ancient  Egyptians,  together  with  amplifications  derived  partly <br/>from  other  Hermetic  fragments  and  partly  from  the  secret  arcanum  of  the  Hermetic  sciences.  For  the <br/>sake  of  clarity,  the  narrative  form  has  been  chosen  in  preference  to  the  original  dialogic  style,  and <br/>obsolete  words  have  given  place  to  those  in  current  use. <br/><br/>Hermes,  while  wandering  in  a  rocky  and  desolate  place,  gave  himself  over  to  meditation  and  prayer. <br/>Following  the  secret  instructions  of  the  Temple,  he  gradually  freed  his  higher  consciousness  from  the <br/>bondage  of  his  bodily  senses;  and,  thus  released,  his  divine  nature  revealed  to  him  the  mysteries  of <br/>the  transcendental  spheres.  He  beheld  a  figure,  terrible  and  awe-inspiring.  It  was  the  Great  Dragon, <br/>with  wings  stretching  across  the  sky  and  light  streaming  in  all  directions  from  its  body.  (The <br/>Mysteries  taught  that  the  Universal  Life  was  personified  as  a  dragon.)  The  Great  Dragon  called <br/>Hermes  by  name,  and  asked  him  why  he  thus  meditated  upon  the  World  Mystery.  Terrified  by  the <br/>spectacle,  Hermes  prostrated  himself  before  the  Dragon,  beseeching  it  to  reveal  its  identity.  The  great <br/>creature  answered  that  it  was  Poimandres,  the  Mind  of  the  Universe,  the  Creative  Intelligence,  and <br/>the  Absolute  Emperor  of  all.  (Schure  identifies  Poimandres  as  the  god  Osiris.)  Hermes  then  besought <br/>Poimandres  to  disclose  the  nature  of  the  universe  and  the  constitution  of  the  gods.  The  Dragon <br/>acquiesced,  bidding  Trismegistus  hold  its  image  in  his  mind. <br/><br/>Immediately  the  form  of  Poimandres  changed.  Where  it  had  stood  there  was  a  glorious  and  pulsating <br/>Radiance.  This  Light  was  the  spiritual  nature  of  the  Great  Dragon  itself.  Hermes  was  &quot;raised&quot;  into  the <br/>midst  of  this  Divine  Effulgence  and  the  universe  of  material  things  faded  from  his  consciousness. <br/>Presently  a  great  darkness  descended  and,  expanding,  swallowed  up  the  Light.  Everything  was <br/>troubled.  About  Hermes  swirled  a  mysterious  watery  substance  which  gave  forth  a  smokelike  vapor. <br/>The  air  was  filled  with  inarticulate  moanings  and  sighings  which  seemed  to  come  from  the  Light <br/>swallowed  up  in  the  darkness.  His  mind  told  Hermes  that <br/><br/><br/>THOTH,  THE  IBIS-HEADED. <br/><br/>From  Wilkinson's  Manners  &amp;  Customs  of  the  Ancient  Egyptians. <br/><br/>It  is  doubtful  that  the  deity  called  Thoth  by  the  Egyptians  was  originally  Hermes,  but  the  two  personalities  were  blended <br/>together  and  it  is  now  impossible  to  separate  them.  Thoth  was  called  &quot;The  Lord  of  the  Divine  Books&quot;  and  &quot;Scribe  of  the <br/>Company  of  the  Gods.&quot;  He  is  generally  depicted  with  the  body  of  a  man  and  the  head  of  an  ibis.  The  exact  symbolic <br/>meaning  of  this  latter  bird  has  never  been  discovered.  A  careful  analysis  of  the  peculiar  shape  of  the  ibis&#x2014;especially  its <br/>head  and  beak&#x2014;should  prove  illuminating. <br/><br/>p-  39 <br/><br/>the  Light  was  the  form  of  the  spiritual  universe  and  that  the  swirhng  darkness  which  had  engulfed  it <br/>represented  material  substance. <br/><br/>Then  out  of  the  imprisoned  Light  a  mysterious  and  Holy  Word  came  forth  and  took  its  stand  upon  the <br/>smoking  waters.  This  Word&#x2014; the  Voice  of  the  Light&#x2014; rose  out  of  the  darkness  as  a  great  pillar,  and  the <br/>fire  and  the  air  followed  after  it,  but  the  earth  and  the  water  remained  unmoved  below.  Thus  the <br/>waters  of  Light  were  divided  from  the  waters  of  darkness,  and  from  the  waters  of  Light  were  formed <br/>the  worlds  above  and  from  the  waters  of  darkness  were  formed  the  worlds  below.  The  earth  and  the <br/>water  next  mingled,  becoming  inseparable,  and  the  Spiritual  Word  which  is  called  Reason  moved <br/>upon  their  surface,  causing  endless  turmoil. <br/><br/>Then  again  was  heard  the  voice  of  Poimandres,  but  His  form  was  not  revealed:  &quot;I  Thy  God  am  the <br/>Light  and  the  Mind  which  were  before  substance  was  divided  from  spirit  and  darkness  from  Light. <br/>And  the  Word  which  appeared  as  a  pillar  of  flame  out  of  the  darkness  is  the  Son  of  God,  born  of  the <br/>mystery  of  the  Mind.  The  name  of  that  Word  is  Reason.  Reason  is  the  offspring  of  Thought  and <br/>Reason  shall  divide  the  Light  from  the  darkness  and  establish  Truth  in  the  midst  of  the  waters. <br/>Understand,  O  Hermes,  and  meditate  deeply  upon  the  mystery.  That  which  in  you  sees  and  hears  is <br/>not  of  the  earth,  but  is  the  Word  of  God  incarnate.  So  it  is  said  that  Divine  Light  dwells  in  the  midst  of <br/>mortal  darkness,  and  ignorance  cannot  divide  them.  The  union  of  the  Word  and  the  Mind  produces <br/>that  mystery  which  is  called  Life.  As  the  darkness  without  you  is  divided  against  itself,  so  the  darkness <br/>within  you  is  likewise  divided.  The  Light  and  the  fire  which  rise  are  the  divine  man,  ascending  in  the <br/>path  of  the  Word,  and  that  which  fails  to  ascend  is  the  mortal  man,  which  may  not  partake  of <br/>immortality.  Learn  deeply  of  the  Mind  and  its  mystery,  for  therein  lies  the  secret  of  immortality.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Dragon  again  revealed  its  form  to  Hermes,  and  for  a  long  time  the  two  looked  steadfastly  one <br/>upon  the  other,  eye  to  eye,  so  that  Hermes  trembled  before  the  gaze  of  Poimandres.  At  the  Word  of <br/><br/><br/>the  Dragon  the  heavens  opened  and  the  innumerable  Light  Powers  were  revealed,  soaring  through <br/>Cosmos  on  pinions  of  streaming  fire.  Hermes  beheld  the  spirits  of  the  stars,  the  celestials  controlling <br/>the  universe,  and  all  those  Powers  which  shine  with  the  radiance  of  the  One  Fire&#x2014;the  glory  of  the <br/>Sovereign  Mind.  Hermes  realized  that  the  sight  which  he  beheld  was  revealed  to  him  only  because <br/>Poimandres  had  spoken  a  Word.  The  Word  was  Reason,  and  by  the  Reason  of  the  Word  invisible <br/>things  were  made  manifest.  Divine  Mind&#x2014;the  Dragon&#x2014; continued  its  discourse: <br/><br/>&quot;Before  the  visible  universe  was  formed  its  mold  was  cast.  This  mold  was  called  the  Archetype,  and <br/>this  Archetype  was  in  the  Supreme  Mind  long  before  the  process  of  creation  began.  Beholding  the <br/>Archetypes,  the  Supreme  Mind  became  enamored  with  Its  own  thought;  so,  taking  the  Word  as  a <br/>mighty  hammer,  It  gouged  out  caverns  in  primordial  space  and  cast  the  form  of  the  spheres  in  the <br/>Archetypal  mold,  at  the  same  time  sowing  in  the  newly  fashioned  bodies  the  seeds  of  living  things. <br/>The  darkness  below,  receiving  the  hammer  of  the  Word,  was  fashioned  into  an  orderly  universe.  The <br/>elements  separated  into  strata  and  each  brought  forth  living  creatures.  The  Supreme  Being&#x2014; the <br/>Mind&#x2014; male  and  female,  brought  forth  the  Word;  and  the  Word,  suspended  between  Light  and <br/>darkness,  was  delivered  of  another  Mind  called  the  Workman,  the  Master-Builder,  or  the  Maker  of <br/>Things. <br/><br/>&quot;In  this  manner  it  was  accomplished,  O  Hermes:  The  Word  moving  like  a  breath  through  space  called <br/>forth  the  Fire  by  the  friction  of  its  motion.  Therefore,  the  Fire  is  called  the  Son  of  Striving.  The <br/>Workman  passed  as  a  whirlwind  through  the  universe,  causing  the  substances  to  vibrate  and  glow <br/>with  its  friction,  The  Son  of  Striving  thus  formed  Seven  Governors,  the  Spirits  of  the  Planets,  whose <br/>orbits  bounded  the  world;  and  the  Seven  Governors  controlled  the  world  by  the  mysterious  power <br/>called  Destiny  given  them  by  the  Fiery  Workman.  When  the  Second  Mind  (The  Workman)  had <br/>organized  Chaos,  the  Word  of  God  rose  straightway  our  of  its  prison  of  substance,  leaving  the <br/>elements  without  Reason,  and  joined  Itself  to  the  nature  of  the  Fiery  Workman.  Then  the  Second <br/>Mind,  together  with  the  risen  Word,  established  Itself  in  the  midst  of  the  universe  and  whirled  the <br/>wheels  of  the  Celestial  Powers.  This  shall  continue  from  an  infinite  beginning  to  an  infinite  end,  for <br/>the  beginning  and  the  ending  are  in  the  same  place  and  state. <br/><br/>&quot;Then  the  downward-turned  and  unreasoning  elements  brought  forth  creatures  without  Reason. <br/>Substance  could  not  bestow  Reason,  for  Reason  had  ascended  out  of  it.  The  air  produced  flying  things <br/>and  the  waters  such  as  swim.  The  earth  conceived  strange  four-footed  and  creeping  beasts,  dragons, <br/>composite  demons,  and  grotesque  monsters.  Then  the  Father&#x2014; the  Supreme  Mind&#x2014; being  Light  and <br/>Life,  fashioned  a  glorious  Universal  Man  in  Its  own  image,  not  an  earthy  man  but  a  heavenly  Man <br/>dwelling  in  the  Light  of  God.  The  Supreme  Mind  loved  the  Man  It  had  fashioned  and  delivered  to <br/>Him  the  control  of  the  creations  and  workmanships. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Man,  desiring  to  labor,  took  up  His  abode  in  the  sphere  of  generation  and  observed  the  works  of <br/>His  brother&#x2014; the  Second  Mind&#x2014; which  sat  upon  the  Ring  of  the  Fire.  And  having  beheld  the <br/>achievements  of  the  Fiery  Workman,  He  willed  also  to  make  things,  and  His  Father  gave  permission. <br/>The  Seven  Governors,  of  whose  powers  He  partook,  rejoiced  and  each  gave  the  Man  a  share  of  Its  own <br/>nature. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Man  longed  to  pierce  the  circumference  of  the  circles  and  understand  the  mystery  of  Him  who <br/>sat  upon  the  Eternal  Fire.  Having  already  all  power.  He  stooped  down  and  peeped  through  the  seven <br/>Harmonies  and,  breaking  through  the  strength  of  the  circles,  made  Himself  manifest  to  Nature <br/>stretched  out  below.  The  Man,  looking  into  the  depths,  smiled,  for  He  beheld  a  shadow  upon  the <br/>earth  and  a  likeness  mirrored  in  the  waters,  which  shadow  and  likeness  were  a  reflection  of  Himself. <br/>The  Man  fell  in  love  with  His  own  shadow  and  desired  to  descend  into  it.  Coincident  with  the  desire, <br/>the  Intelligent  Thing  united  Itself  with  the  unreasoning  image  or  shape. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;Nature,  beholding  the  descent,  wrapped  herself  about  the  Man  whom  she  loved,  and  the  two  were <br/>mingled.  For  this  reason,  earthy  man  is  composite.  Within  him  is  the  Sky  Man,  immortal  and <br/>beautiful;  without  is  Nature,  mortal  and  destructible.  Thus,  suffering  is  the  result  of  the  Immortal <br/>Man's  falling  in  love  with  His  shadow  and  giving  up  Reality  to  dwell  in  the  darkness  of  illusion;  for, <br/>being  immortal,  man  has  the  power  of  the  Seven  Governors&#x2014;also  the  Life,  the  Light,  and  the  Word- <br/>but  being  mortal,  he  is  controlled  by  the  Rings  of  the  Governors&#x2014;Fate  or  Destiny. <br/><br/>&quot;Of  the  Immortal  Man  it  should  be  said  that  He  is  hermaphrodite,  or  male  and  female,  and  eternally <br/>watchful.  He  neither  slumbers  nor  sleeps,  and  is  governed  by  a  Father  also  both  male  and  female,  and <br/>ever  watchful.  Such  is  the  mystery  kept  hidden  to  this  day,  for  Nature,  being  mingled  in  marriage  with <br/>the  Sky  Man,  brought  forth  a  wonder  most  wonderful&#x2014; seven  men,  all  bisexual,  male  and  female,  and <br/>upright  of  stature,  each  one  exemplifying  the  natures  of  the  Seven  Governors.  These  O  Hermes,  are <br/>the  seven  races,  species,  and  wheels. <br/><br/>&quot;After  this  manner  were  the  seven  men  generated.  Earth  was  the  female  element  and  water  the  male <br/>element,  and  from  the  fire  and  the  gether  they  received  their  spirits,  and  Nature  produced  bodies  after <br/>the  species  and  shapes  of  men.  And  man  received  the  Life  and  Light  of  the  Great  Dragon,  and  of  the <br/>Life  was  made  his  Soul  and  of  the  Light  his  Mind.  And  so,  all  these  composite  creatures  containing <br/>immortality,  but  partaking  of  mortality,  continued  in  this  state  for  the  duration  of  a  period.  They <br/>reproduced  themselves  out  of  themselves,  for  each  was  male  and  female.  But  at  the  end  of  the  period <br/>the  knot  of  Destiny  was  untied  by  the  will  of  God  and  the  bond  of  all  things  was  loosened. <br/><br/>&quot;Then  all  living  creatures,  including  man,  which  had  been  hermaphroditical,  were  separated,  the <br/>males  being  set  apart  by  themselves  and  the  females  likewise,  according  to  the  dictates  of  Reason. <br/><br/>&quot;Then  God  spoke  to  the  Holy  Word  within  the  soul  of  all  things,  saying:  'Increase  in  increasing  and <br/>multiply  in  multitudes,  all  you,  my  creatures  and  workmanships.  Let  him  that  is  endued  with  Mind <br/>know  himself  to  be  immortal  and  that  the  cause  of  death  is  the  love  of  the  body;  and  let  him  learn  all <br/>things  that  are,  for  he  who  has  recognized  himself  enters  into  the  state  of  Good.' <br/><br/><br/>The  name  Hermes  is  derived  from  &quot;Herm,&quot;  a  form  of  CHiram,  the  Personified  Universal  Life  Principle,  generally <br/>represented  by  fire.  The  Scandinavians  worshiped  Hermes  under  the  name  of  Odin;  the  Teutons  as  Wotan,  and  certain  of <br/>the  Oriental  peoples  as  Buddha,  or  Fo.  There  are  two  theories  concerning  his  demise.  The  first  declares  that  Hermes  was <br/><br/><br/>Sexmes  KTJIN. <br/><br/><br/>A  GREEK  FORM  OF  HERMES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Bryant's  Mythology. <br/><br/><br/>translated  like  Enoch  and  carried  without  death  into  the  presence  of  God,  the  second  states  that  he  was  buried  in  the <br/>Valley  of  Ebron  and  a  great  treasure  placed  in  his  tomb&#x2014;not  a  treasure  of  gold  but  of  books  and  sacred  learning. <br/><br/>The  Egyptians  likened  humanity  to  a  flock  of  sheep.  The  Supreme  and  Inconceivable  Father  was  the  Shepherd,  and <br/>Hermes  was  the  shepherd  dog.  The  origin  of  the  shepherd's  crook  in  religious  symbolism  may  be  traced  to  the  Egyptian <br/>rituals.  The  three  scepters  of  Egypt  include  the  shepherd's  crook,  symbolizing  that  by  virtue  of  the  power  reposing  in  that <br/>symbolic  staff  the  initiated  Pharaohs  guided  the  destiny  of  their  people. <br/><br/>p.  40 <br/><br/>&quot;And  when  God  had  said  this,  Providence,  with  the  aid  of  the  Seven  Governors  and  Harmony,  brought <br/>the  sexes  together,  making  the  mixtures  and  estabhshing  the  generations,  and  all  things  were <br/>multiplied  according  to  their  kind.  He  who  through  the  error  of  attachment  loves  his  body,  abides <br/>wandering  in  darkness,  sensible  and  suffering  the  things  of  death,  but  he  who  realizes  that  the  body  is <br/>but  the  tomb  of  his  soul,  rises  to  immortality.&quot; <br/><br/>Then  Hermes  desired  to  know  why  men  should  be  deprived  of  immortality  for  the  sin  of  ignorance <br/>alone.  The  Great  Dragon  answered:.  To  the  ignorant  the  body  is  supreme  and  they  are  incapable  of <br/>realizing  the  immortality  that  is  within  them.  Knowing  only  the  body  which  is  subject  to  death,  they <br/>believe  in  death  because  they  worship  that  substance  which  is  the  cause  and  reality  of  death.&quot; <br/><br/>Then  Hermes  asked  how  the  righteous  and  wise  pass  to  God,  to  which  Poimandres  replied:  &quot;That <br/>which  the  Word  of  God  said,  say  I:  'Because  the  Father  of  all  things  consists  of  Life  and  Light,  whereof <br/>man  is  made.'  If,  therefore,  a  man  shall  learn  and  understand  the  nature  of  Life  and  Light,  then  he <br/>shall  pass  into  the  eternity  of  Life  and  Light.&quot; <br/><br/>Hermes  next  inquired  about  the  road  by  which  the  wise  attained  to  Life  eternal,  and  Poimandres <br/>continued:  &quot;Let  the  man  endued  with  a  Mind  mark,  consider,  and  learn  of  himself,  and  with  the <br/>power  of  his  Mind  divide  himself  from  his  not-self  and  become  a  servant  of  Reality.&quot; <br/><br/>Hermes  asked  if  all  men  did  not  have  Minds,  and  the  Great  Dragon  replied:  &quot;Take  heed  what  you  say, <br/>for  I  am  the  Mind&#x2014;the  Eternal  Teacher.  I  am  the  Father  of  the  Word&#x2014;the  Redeemer  of  all  men&#x2014; and <br/>in  the  nature  of  the  wise  the  Word  takes  flesh.  By  means  of  the  Word,  the  world  is  saved.  I,  Thought <br/>(Thoth)~the  Father  of  the  Word,  the  Mind&#x2014; come  only  unto  men  that  are  holy  and  good,  pure  and <br/>merciful,  and  that  live  piously  and  religiously,  and  my  presence  is  an  inspiration  and  a  help  to  them, <br/>for  when  I  come  they  immediately  know  all  things  and  adore  the  Universal  Father.  Before  such  wise <br/>and  philosophic  ones  die,  they  learn  to  renounce  their  senses,  knowing  that  these  are  the  enemies  of <br/>their  immortal  souls. <br/><br/>&quot;I  will  not  permit  the  evil  senses  to  control  the  bodies  of  those  who  love  me,  nor  will  I  allow  evil <br/>emotions  and  evil  thoughts  to  enter  them.  I  become  as  a  porter  or  doorkeeper,  and  shut  out  evil, <br/>protecting  the  wise  from  their  own  lower  nature.  But  to  the  wicked,  the  envious  and  the  covetous,  I <br/>come  not,  for  such  cannot  understand  the  mysteries  of  Mind;  therefore,  I  am  unwelcome.  I  leave <br/>them  to  the  avenging  demon  that  they  are  making  in  their  own  souls,  for  evil  each  day  increases  itself <br/>and  torments  man  more  sharply,  and  each  evil  deed  adds  to  the  evil  deeds  that  are  gone  before  until <br/>finally  evil  destroys  itself.  The  punishment  of  desire  is  the  agony  of  unfulfillment.&quot; <br/><br/>Hermes  bowed  his  head  in  thankfulness  to  the  Great  Dragon  who  had  taught  him  so  much,  and <br/>begged  to  hear  more  concerning  the  ultimate  of  the  human  soul.  So  Poimandres  resumed:  &quot;At  death <br/>the  material  body  of  man  is  returned  to  the  elements  from  which  it  came,  and  the  invisible  divine <br/>man  ascends  to  the  source  from  whence  he  came,  namely  the  Eighth  Sphere.  The  evil  passes  to  the <br/>dwelling  place  of  the  demon,  and  the  senses,  feelings,  desires,  and  body  passions  return  to  their <br/>source,  namely  the  Seven  Governors,  whose  natures  in  the  lower  man  destroy  but  in  the  invisible <br/>spiritual  man  give  life. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;After  the  lower  nature  has  returned  to  the  brutishness,  the  higher  struggles  again  to  regain  its <br/>spiritual  estate.  It  ascends  the  seven  Rings  upon  which  sit  the  Seven  Governors  and  returns  to  each <br/>their  lower  powers  in  this  manner:  Upon  the  first  ring  sits  the  Moon,  and  to  it  is  returned  the  ability <br/>to  increase  and  diminish.  Upon  the  second  ring  sits  Mercury,  and  to  it  are  returned  machinations, <br/>deceit,  and  craftiness.  Upon  the  third  ring  sits  Venus,  and  to  it  are  returned  the  lusts  and  passions. <br/>Upon  the  fourth  ring  sits  the  Sun,  and  to  this  Lord  are  returned  ambitions.  Upon  the  fifth  ring  sits <br/>Mars,  and  to  it  are  returned  rashness  and  profane  boldness.  Upon  the  sixth  ring  sits  Jupiter,  and  to  it <br/>are  returned  the  sense  of  accumulation  and  riches.  And  upon  the  seventh  ring  sits  Saturn,  at  the  Gate <br/>of  Chaos,  and  to  it  are  returned  falsehood  and  evil  plotting. <br/><br/>&quot;Then,  being  naked  of  all  the  accumulations  of  the  seven  Rings,  the  soul  comes  to  the  Eighth  Sphere, <br/>namely,  the  ring  of  the  fixed  stars.  Here,  freed  of  all  illusion,  it  dwells  in  the  Light  and  sings  praises  to <br/>the  Father  in  a  voice  which  only  the  pure  of  spirit  may  understand.  Behold,  O  Hermes,  there  is  a  great <br/>mystery  in  the  Eighth  Sphere,  for  the  Milky  Way  is  the  seed-ground  of  souls,  and  from  it  they  drop <br/>into  the  Rings,  and  to  the  Milky  Way  they  return  again  from  the  wheels  of  Saturn.  But  some  cannot <br/>climb  the  seven-runged  ladder  of  the  Rings.  So  they  wander  in  darkness  below  and  are  swept  into <br/>eternity  with  the  illusion  of  sense  and  earthiness. <br/><br/>&quot;The  path  to  immortality  is  hard,  and  only  a  few  find  it.  The  rest  await  the  Great  Day  when  the  wheels <br/>of  the  universe  shall  be  stopped  and  the  immortal  sparks  shall  escape  from  the  sheaths  of  substance. <br/>Woe  unto  those  who  wait,  for  they  must  return  again,  unconscious  and  unknowing,  to  the  seed- <br/>ground  of  stars,  and  await  a  new  beginning.  Those  who  are  saved  by  the  light  of  the  mystery  which  I <br/>have  revealed  unto  you,  O  Hermes,  and  which  I  now  bid  you  to  establish  among  men,  shall  return <br/>again  to  the  Father  who  dwelleth  in  the  White  Light,  and  shall  deliver  themselves  up  to  the  Light  and <br/>shall  be  absorbed  into  the  Light,  and  in  the  Light  they  shall  become  Powers  in  God.  This  is  the  Way  of <br/>Good  and  is  revealed  only  to  them  that  have  wisdom. <br/><br/>&quot;Blessed  art  thou,  O  Son  of  Light,  to  whom  of  all  men,  I,  Poimandres,  the  Light  of  the  World,  have <br/>revealed  myself.  I  order  you  to  go  forth,  to  become  as  a  guide  to  those  who  wander  in  darkness,  that <br/>all  men  within  whom  dwells  the  spirit  of  My  Mind  (The  Universal  Mind)  may  be  saved  by  My  Mind  in <br/>you,  which  shall  call  forth  My  Mind  in  them.  Establish  My  Mysteries  and  they  shall  not  fail  from  the <br/>earth,  for  I  am  the  Mind  of  the  Mysteries  and  until  Mind  fails  (which  is  never)  my  Mysteries  cannot <br/>fail.&quot;  With  these  parting  words,  Poimandres,  radiant  with  celestial  light,  vanished,  mingling  with  the <br/>powers  of  the  heavens.  Raising  his  eyes  unto  the  heavens,  Hermes  blessed  the  Father  of  All  Things <br/>and  consecrated  his  life  to  the  service  of  the  Great  Light. <br/><br/>Thus  preached  Hermes:  &quot;O  people  of  the  earth,  men  born  and  made  of  the  elements,  but  with  the <br/>spirit  of  the  Divine  Man  within  you,  rise  from  your  sleep  of  ignorance!  Be  sober  and  thoughtful. <br/>Realize  that  your  home  is  not  in  the  earth  but  in  the  Light.  Why  have  you  delivered  yourselves  over <br/>unto  death,  having  power  to  partake  of  immortality?  Repent,  and  change  your  minds.  Depart  from <br/>the  dark  light  and  forsake  corruption  forever.  Prepare  yourselves  to  climb  through  the  Seven  Rings <br/>and  to  blend  your  souls  with  the  eternal  Light.&quot; <br/><br/>Some  who  heard  mocked  and  scoffed  and  went  their  way,  delivering  themselves  to  the  Second  Death <br/>from  which  there  is  no  salvation.  But  others,  casting  themselves  before  the  feet  of  Hermes,  besought <br/>him  to  teach  them  the  Way  of  Life.  He  lifted  them  gently,  receiving  no  approbation  for  himself,  and <br/>staff  in  hand,  went  forth  teaching  and  guiding  mankind,  and  showing  them  how  they  might  be  saved. <br/>In  the  worlds  of  men,  Hermes  sowed  the  seeds  of  wisdom  and  nourished  the  seeds  with  the  Immortal <br/>Waters.  And  at  last  came  the  evening  of  his  life,  and  as  the  brightness  of  the  light  of  earth  was <br/>beginning  to  go  down,  Hermes  commanded  his  disciples  to  preserve  his  doctrines  inviolate <br/>throughout  all  ages.  The  Vision  of  Poimandres  he  committed  to  writing  that  all  men  desiring <br/>immortality  might  therein  find  the  way. <br/><br/><br/>In  concluding  his  exposition  of  the  Vision,  Hermes  wrote:  &quot;The  sleep  of  the  body  is  the  sober <br/>watchfulness  of  the  Mind  and  the  shutting  of  my  eyes  reveals  the  true  Light.  My  silence  is  filled  with <br/>budding  life  and  hope,  and  is  full  of  good.  My  words  are  the  blossoms  of  fruit  of  the  tree  of  my  soul. <br/>For  this  is  the  faithful  account  of  what  I  received  from  my  true  Mind,  that  is  Poimandres,  the  Great <br/>Dragon,  the  Lord  of  the  Word,  through  whom  I  became  inspired  by  God  with  the  Truth.  Since  that <br/>day  my  Mind  has  been  ever  with  me  and  in  my  own  soul  it  hath  given  birth  to  the  Word:  the  Word  is <br/>Reason,  and  Reason  hath  redeemed  me.  For  which  cause,  with  all  my  soul  and  all  my  strength,  I  give <br/>praise  and  blessing  unto  God  the  Father,  the  Life  and  the  Light,  and  the  Eternal  Good. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  is  God,  the  Father  of  all  things,  the  One  who  is  before  the  First  Beginning. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  is  God,  whose  will  is  performed  and  accomplished  by  His  own  Powers  which  He  hath  given <br/>birth  to  out  of  Himself. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  is  God,  who  has  determined  that  He  shall  be  known,  and  who  is  known  by  His  own  to  whom  He <br/>reveals  Himself. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  who  by  Thy  Word  (Reason)  hast  established  all  things. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  of  whom  all  Nature  is  the  image. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  whom  the  inferior  nature  has  not  formed. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  who  art  stronger  than  all  powers. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  who  art  greater  than  all  excellency. <br/><br/>&quot;Holy  art  Thou,  who  art  better  than  all  praise. <br/><br/>&quot;Accept  these  reasonable  sacrifices  from  a  pure  soul  and  a  heart  stretched  out  unto  Thee. <br/>&quot;O  Thou  Unspeakable,  Unutterable,  to  be  praised  with  silence! <br/><br/>&quot;I  beseech  Thee  to  look  mercifully  upon  me,  that  I  may  not  err  from  the  knowledge  of  Thee  and  that  I <br/>may  enlighten  those  that  are  in  ignorance,  my  brothers  and  Thy  sons. <br/><br/>&quot;Therefore  I  believe  Thee  and  bear  witness  unto  Thee,  and  depart  in  peace  and  in  trustfulness  into <br/>Thy  Light  and  Life. <br/><br/>&quot;Blessed  art  Thou,  O  Father!  The  man  Thou  hast  fashioned  would  be  sanctified  with  Thee  as  Thou <br/>hast  given  him  power  to  sanctify  others  with  Thy  Word  and  Thy  Truth.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Vision  of  Hermes,  like  nearly  all  of  the  Hermetic  writings,  is  an  allegorical  exposition  of  great <br/>philosophic  and  mystic  truths,  and  its  hidden  meaning  may  be  comprehended  only  by  those  who  have <br/>been  &quot;raised&quot;  into  the  presence  of  the  True  Mind. <br/><br/><br/>&#x2022;  41 <br/><br/>The  Initiation  of  the  Pyramid <br/><br/>SUPREME  among  the  wonders  of  antiquity,  unrivaled  by  the  achievements  of  later  architects  and <br/>builders,  the  Great  Pyramid  of  Gizeh  bears  mute  witness  to  an  unknown  civilization  which,  having <br/>completed  its  predestined  span,  passed  into  oblivion.  Eloquent  in  its  silence,  inspiring  in  its  majesty, <br/>divine  in  its  simplicity,  the  Great  Pyramid  is  indeed  a  sermon  in  stone.  Its  magnitude  overwhelms  the <br/>puny  sensibilities  of  man.  Among  the  shifting  sands  of  time  it  stands  as  a  fitting  emblem  of  eternity <br/>itself.  Who  were  the  illumined  mathematicians  who  planned  its  parts  and  dimensions,  the  master <br/>craftsmen  who  supervised  its  construction,  the  skilled  artisans  who  trued  its  blocks  of  stone? <br/><br/>The  earliest  and  best-known  account  of  the  building  of  the  Great  Pyramid  is  that  given  by  that  highly <br/>revered  but  somewhat  imaginative  historian,  Herodotus.  &quot;The  pyramid  was  built  in  steps,  battlement- <br/>wise,  as  it  is  called,  or,  according  to  others,  altar-wise.  After  laying  the  stones  for  the  base,  they  raised <br/>the  remaining  stones  to  their  places  by  means  of  machines  formed  of  short  wooden  planks.  The  first <br/>machine  raised  them  from  the  ground  to  the  top  of  the  first  step.  On  this  there  was  another  machine, <br/>which  received  the  stone  upon  its  arrival,  and  conveyed  it  to  the  second  step,  whence  a  third  machine <br/>advanced  it  still  higher.  Either  they  had  as  many  machines  as  there  were  steps  in  the  pyramid,  or <br/>possibly  they  had  but  a  single  machine,  which,  being  easily  moved,  was  transferred  from  tier  to  tier  as <br/>the  stone  rose.  Both  accounts  are  given,  and  therefore  I  mention  both.  The  upper  portion  of  the <br/>pyramid  was  finished  first,  then  the  middle,  and  finally  the  part  which  was  lowest  and  nearest  the <br/>ground.  There  is  an  inscription  in  Egyptian  characters  on  the  pyramid  which  records  the  quantity  of <br/>radishes,  onions,  and  garlick  consumed  by  the  labourers  who  constructed  it;  and  I  perfectly  well <br/>remember  that  the  interpreter  who  read  the  writing  to  me  said  that  the  money  expended  in  this  way <br/>was  1600  talents  of  silver.  If  this  then  is  a  true  record,  what  a  vast  sum  must  have  been  spent  on  the <br/>iron  tools  used  in  the  work,  and  on  the  feeding  and  clothing  of  the  labourers,  considering  the  length <br/>of  time  the  work  lasted,  which  has  already  been  stated  [ten  years],  and  the  additional  time&#x2014;no  small <br/>space,  I  imagine&#x2014;which  must  have  been  occupied  by  the  quarrying  of  the  stones,  their  conveyance, <br/>and  the  formation  of  the  underground  apartments.&quot; <br/><br/>While  his  account  is  extremely  colorful,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Father  of  History,  for  reasons  which  he <br/>doubtless  considered  sufficient,  concocted  a  fraudulent  story  to  conceal  the  true  origin  and  purpose  of <br/>the  Great  Pyramid.  This  is  but  one  of  several  instances  in  his  writings  which  would  lead  the <br/>thoughtful  reader  to  suspect  that  Herodotus  himself  was  an  initiate  of  the  Sacred  Schools  and <br/>consequently  obligated  to  preserve  inviolate  the  secrets  of  the  ancient  orders.  The  theory  advanced  by <br/>Herodotus  and  now  generally  accepted  that  the  Pyramid  was  the  tomb  of  the  Pharaoh  Cheops  cannot <br/>be  substantiated.  In  fact,  Manetho,  Eratosthenes,  and  Diodorus  Siculus  all  differ  from  Herodotus&#x2014; as <br/>well  as  from  each  other&#x2014; regarding  the  name  of  the  builder  of  this  supreme  edifice.  The  sepulchral <br/>vault,  which,  according  to  the  Lepsius  Law  of  pyramid  construction,  should  have  been  finished  at  the <br/>same  time  as  the  monument  or  sooner,  was  never  completed.  There  is  no  proof  that  the  building  was <br/>erected  by  the  Egyptians,  for  the  elaborate  carvings  with  which  the  burial  chambers  of  Egyptian <br/>royalty  are  almost  invariably  ornamented  are  entirely  lacking  and  it  embodies  none  of  the  elements  of <br/>their  architecture  or  decoration,  such  as  inscriptions,  images,  cartouches,  paintings,  and  other <br/>distinctive  features  associated  with  dynastic  mortuary  art.  The  only  hieroglyphics  to  be  found  within <br/>the  Pyramid  are  a  few  builders'  marks  sealed  up  in  the  chambers  of  construction,  first  opened  by <br/>Howard  Vyse.  These  apparently  were  painted  upon  the  stones  before  they  were  set  in  position,  for  in  a <br/>number  of  instances  the  marks  were  either  inverted  or  disfigured  by  the  operation  of  fitting  the  blocks <br/>together.  While  Egyptologists  have  attempted  to  identify  the  crude  dabs  of  paint  as  cartouches  of <br/>Cheops,  it  is  almost  inconceivable  that  this  ambitious  ruler  would  have  permitted  his  royal  name  to <br/>suffer  such  indignities.  As  the  most  eminent  authorities  on  the  subject  are  still  uncertain  as  to  the  true <br/>meaning  of  these  crude  markings,  whatever  proof  they  might  be  that  the  building  was  erected  during <br/><br/><br/>the  fourth  dynasty  is  certainly  offset  by  the  sea  shells  at  the  base  of  the  Pyramid  which  Mr.  Gab <br/><br/>advances  as  evidence  that  it  was  erected  before  the  Deluge&#x2014;a  theory  substantiated  by  the  much- <br/>abused  Arabian  traditions.  One  Arabian  historian  declared  that  the  Pyramid  was  built  by  the  Egyptian <br/>sages  as  a  refuge  against  the  Flood,  while  another  proclaimed  it  to  have  been  the  treasure  house  of  the <br/>powerful  antediluvian  king  Sheddad  Ben  Ad.  A  panel  of  hieroglyphs  over  the  entrance,  which  the <br/>casual  observer  might  consider  to  afford  a  solution  of  the  mystery,  unfortunately  dates  back  no <br/>further  than  A.D.  1843,  having  been  cut  at  that  time  by  Dr.  Lepsius  as  a  tribute  to  the  King  of  Prussia. <br/><br/>Caliph  al  Mamoun,  an  illustrious  descendant  of  the  Prophet,  inspired  by  stories  of  the  immense <br/>treasures  sealed  within  its  depths,  journeyed  from  Bagdad  to  Cairo,  A.D.  820,  with  a  great  force  of <br/>workmen  to  open  the  mighty  Pyramid.  When  Caliph  al  Mamoun  first  reached  the  foot  of  the  &quot;Rock  of <br/>Ages&quot;  and  gazed  up  at  its  smooth  glistening  surface,  a  tumult  of  emotions  undoubtedly  racked  his <br/>soul.  The  casing  stones  must  have  been  in  place  at  the  time  of  his  visit,  for  the  Caliph  could  find  no <br/>indication  of  an  entrance&#x2014;four  perfectly  smooth  surfaces  confronted  him.  Following  vague  rumors, <br/>he  set  his  followers  to  work  on  the  north  side  of  the  Pyramid,  with  instructions  to  keep  on  cutting  and <br/>chiseling  until  they  discovered  something.  To  the  Moslems  with  their  crude  instruments  and  vinegar <br/>it  was  a  herculean  effort  to  tunnel  a  full  hundred  feet  through  the  limestone.  Many  times  they  were  on <br/>the  point  of  rebellion,  but  the  word  of  the  Caliph  was  law  and  the  hope  of  a  vast  fortune  buoyed  them <br/>up. <br/><br/>At  last  on  the  eve  of  total  discouragement  fate  came  to  their  rescue.  A  great  stone  was  heard  to  fall <br/>somewhere  in  the  wall  near  the  toiling  and  disgruntled  Arabs.  Pushing  on  toward  the  sound  with <br/>renewed  enthusiasm,  they  finally  broke  into  the  descending  passage  which  leads  into  the <br/>subterranean  chamber.  They  then  chiseled  their  way  around  the  great  stone  portcullis  which  had <br/>fallen  into  a  position  barring  their  progress,  and  attacked  and  removed  one  after  another  the  granite <br/>plugs  which  for  a  while  continued  to  slide  down  the  passage  leading  from  the  Queen's  Chamber  above. <br/><br/>Finally  no  more  blocks  descended  and  the  way  was  clear  for  the  followers  of  the  Prophet.  But  where <br/>were  the  treasures?  From  room  to  room  the  frantic  workmen  rushed,  looking  in  vain  for  loot.  The <br/>discontent  of  the  Moslems  reached  such  a  height  that  Caliph  al  Mamoun&#x2014; who  had  inherited  much  of <br/>the  wisdom  of  his  illustrious  father,  the  Caliph  al  Raschid&#x2014; sent  to  Bagdad  for  funds,  which  he  caused <br/>to  be  secretly  buried  near  the  entrance  of  the  Pyramid.  He  then  ordered  his  men  to  dig  at  that  spot <br/>and  great  was  their  rejoicing  when  the  treasure  was  discovered,  the  workmen  being  deeply  impressed <br/>by  the  wisdom  of  the  antediluvian  monarch  who  had  carefully  estimated  their  wages  and  thoughtfully <br/>caused  the  exact  amount  to  be  buried  for  their  benefit! <br/><br/>The  Caliph  then  returned  to  the  city  of  his  fathers  and  the  Great  Pyramid  was  left  to  the  mercy  of <br/>succeeding  generations.  In  the  ninth  century  the  sun's  rays  striking  the  highly  polished  surfaces  of  the <br/>original  casing  stones  caused  each  side  of  the  Pyramid  to  appear  as <br/><br/><br/>CEDIPUS  AND  THE  SPHINX. <br/><br/><br/>From  Levi's  Les  Mysteres  de  la  Kaballe. <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  Sphinx  is  closely  related  to  the  Greek  legend  of  (Edipus,  who  first  solved  the  famous  riddle  propounded  by <br/>the  mysterious  creature  with  the  body  of  a  winged  lion  and  the  head  of  a  woman  which  frequented  the  highway  leading  to <br/>Thebes.  To  each  who  passed  her  lair  the  sphinx  addressed  the  question,  &quot;What  animal  is  it  that  in  the  morning  goes  on <br/>four  feet,  at  noon  on  two  feet,  and  in  the  evening  on  three  feet?&quot;  These  who  failed  to  answer  her  riddle  she  destroyed. <br/>CEdipus  declared  the  answer  to  be  man  himself,  who  in  childhood  crawled  upon  his  hands  and  knees,  in  manhood  stood <br/>erect,  and  in  old  age  shuffled  along  supporting  himself  by  a  staff.  Discovering  one  who  knew  the  answer  to  her  riddle,  the <br/>sphinx  cast  herself  from  the  cliff  which  bordered  the  road  and  perished. <br/><br/>There  is  still  another  answer  to  the  riddle  of  the  sphinx,  an  answer  best  revealed  by  a  consideration  of  the  Pythagorean <br/>values  of  numbers.  The  4,  the  2  and  the  3  produce  the  sum  of  9,  which  is  the  natural  number  of  man  and  also  of  the  lower <br/>worlds.  The  4  represents  the  ignorant  man,  the  2  the  intellectual  man,  and  the  3  the  spiritual  man.  Infant  humanity  walks <br/>on  four  legs,  evolving  humanity  on  two  legs,  and  to  the  power  of  his  own  mind  the  redeemed  and  illumined  magus  adds <br/>the  staff  of  wisdom.  The  sphinx  is  therefore  the  mystery  of  Nature,  the  embodiment  of  the  secret  doctrine,  and  all  who <br/>cannot  solve  her  riddle  perish.  To  pass  the  sphinx  is  to  attain  personal  immortality. <br/><br/>p.  42 <br/><br/>a  dazzling  triangle  of  light.  Since  that  time,  all  but  two  of  these  casing  stones  have  disappeared. <br/>Investigation  has  resulted  in  their  discovery,  recut  and  resurfaced,  in  the  walls  of  Mohammedan <br/>mosques  and  palaces  in  various  parts  of  Cairo  and  its  environs. <br/><br/>PYRAMID  PROBLEMS <br/><br/>C.  Piazzi  Smyth  asks:  &quot;Was  the  Great  Pyramid,  then,  erected  before  the  invention  of  hieroglyphics, <br/><br/>and  previous  to  the  birth  of  the  Egyptian  religion?&quot;  Time  may  yet  prove  that  the  upper  chambers  of <br/>the  Pyramid  were  a  sealed  mystery  before  the  establishment  of  the  Egyptian  empire.  In  the <br/>subterranean  chamber,  however,  are  markings  which  indicate  that  the  Romans  gained  admission <br/>there.  In  the  light  of  the  secret  philosophy  of  the  Egyptian  initiates,  W.  W.  Harmon,  by  a  series  of <br/>extremely  complicated  yet  exact  mathematical  calculations;  determines  that  the  first  ceremonial  of <br/>the  Pyramid  was  performed  68,890  years  ago  on  the  occasion  when  the  star  Vega  for  the  first  time <br/><br/><br/>sent  its  ray  down  the  descending  passage  into  the  pit.  The  actual  building  of  the  Pyramid  was <br/>accomplished  in  the  period  of  from  ten  to  fifteen  years  immediately  preceding  this  date. <br/><br/>While  such  figures  doubtless  will  evoke  the  ridicule  of  modern  Egyptologists,  they  are  based  upon  an <br/>exhaustive  study  of  the  principles  of  sidereal  mechanics  as  incorporated  into  the  structure  of  the <br/>Pyramid  by  its  initiated  builders.  If  the  casing  stones  were  in  position  at  the  beginning  of  the  ninth <br/>century,  the  so-called  erosion  marks  upon  the  outside  were  not  due  to  water.  The  theory  also  that  the <br/>salt  upon  the  interior  stones  of  the  Pyramid  is  evidence  that  the  building  was  once  submerged  is <br/>weakened  by  the  scientific  fact  that  this  kind  of  stone  is  subject  to  exudations  of  salt.  While  the <br/>building  may  have  been  submerged,  at  least  in  part,  during  the  many  thousands  of  years  since  its <br/>erection,  the  evidence  adduced  to  prove  this  point  is  not  conclusive. <br/><br/>The  Great  Pyramid  was  built  of  limestone  and  granite  throughout,  the  two  kinds  of  rock  being <br/>combined  in  a  peculiar  and  significant  manner.  The  stones  were  trued  with  the  utmost  precision,  and <br/>the  cement  used  was  of  such  remarkable  quality  that  it  is  now  practically  as  hard  as  the  stone  itself. <br/>The  limestone  blocks  were  sawed  with  bronze  saws,  the  teeth  of  which  were  diamonds  or  other  jewels. <br/>The  chips  from  the  stones  were  piled  against  the  north  side  of  the  plateau  on  which  the  structure <br/>stands,  where  they  form  an  additional  buttress  to  aid  in  supporting  the  weight  of  the  structure.  The <br/>entire  Pyramid  is  an  example  of  perfect  orientation  and  actually  squares  the  circle.  This  last  is <br/>accomplished  by  dropping  a  vertical  line  from  the  apex  of  the  Pyramid  to  its  base  line.  If  this  vertical <br/>line  be  considered  as  the  radius  of  an  imaginary  circle,  the  length  of  the  circumference  of  such  a  circle <br/>will  be  found  to  equal  the  sum  of  the  base  lines  of  the  four  sides  of  the  Pyramid. <br/><br/>If  the  passage  leading  to  the  King's  Chamber  and  the  Queen's  Chamber  was  sealed  up  thousands  of <br/>years  before  the  Christian  Era,  those  later  admitted  into  the  Pyramid  Mysteries  must  have  received <br/>their  initiations  in  subterranean  galleries  now  unknown.  Without  such  galleries  there  could  have  been <br/>no  possible  means  of  ingress  or  egress,  since  the  single  surface  entrance  was  completely  dosed  with <br/>casing  stones.  If  not  blocked  by  the  mass  of  the  Sphinx  or  concealed  in  some  part  of  that  image,  the <br/>secret  entrance  may  be  either  in  one  of  the  adjacent  temples  or  upon  the  sides  of  the  limestone <br/>plateau. <br/><br/>Attention  is  called  to  the  granite  plugs  filling  the  ascending  passageway  to  the  Queen's  Chamber <br/>which  Caliph  al  Mamoun  was  forced  practically  to  pulverize  before  he  could  clear  a  way  into  the  upper <br/>chambers.  C.  Piazzi  Sm5ith  notes  that  the  positions  of  the  stones  demonstrate  that  they  were  set  in <br/>place  from  above&#x2014;which  made  it  necessary  for  a  considerable  number  of  workmen  to  depart  from  the <br/>upper  chambers.  How  did  they  do  it?  Smyth  believes  they  descended  through  the  well  (see  diagram), <br/>dropping  the  ramp  stone  into  place  behind  them.  He  further  contends  that  robbers  probably  used  the <br/>well  as  a  means  of  getting  into  the  upper  chambers.  The  ramp  stone  having  been  set  in  a  bed  of <br/>plaster,  the  robbers  were  forced  to  break  through  it,  leaving  a  jagged  opening.  Mr.  Dupre,  an  architect <br/>who  has  spent  years  investigating  the  pyramids,  differs  from  Smyth,  however,  in  that  he  believes  the <br/>well  itself  to  be  a  robbers'  hole,  being  the  first  successful  attempt  made  to  enter  the  upper  chambers <br/>from  the  subterranean  chamber,  then  the  only  open  section  of  the  Pyramid. <br/><br/>Mr.  Dupre  bases  his  conclusion  upon  the  fact  that  the  well  is  merely  a  rough  hole  and  the  grotto  an <br/>irregular  chamber,  without  any  evidence  of  the  architectural  precision  with  which  the  remainder  of <br/>the  structure  was  erected.  The  diameter  of  the  well  also  precludes  the  possibility  of  its  having  been <br/>dug  downward;  it  must  have  been  gouged  out  from  below,  and  the  grotto  was  necessary  to  supply  air <br/>to  the  thieves.  It  is  inconceivable  that  the  Pyramid  builders  would  break  one  of  their  own  ramp  stones <br/>and  leave  its  broken  surface  and  a  gaping  hole  in  the  side  wall  of  their  otherwise  perfect  gallery.  If  the <br/>well  is  a  robbers'  hole,  it  may  explain  why  the  Pyramid  was  empty  when  Caliph  al  Mamoun  entered  it <br/>and  what  happened  to  the  missing  coffer  lid.  A  careful  examination  of  the  so-called  unfinished <br/>subterranean  chamber,  which  must  have  been  the  base  of  operations  for  the  robbers,  might  disclose <br/>traces  of  their  presence  or  show  where  they  piled  the  rubble  which  must  have  accumulated  as  a  result <br/><br/><br/>of  their  operations.  While  it  is  not  entirely  clear  by  what  entrance  the  robbers  reached  the <br/>subterranean  chamber,  it  is  improbable  that  they  used  the  descending  passageway. <br/><br/>There  is  a  remarkable  niche  in  the  north  wall  of  the  Queen's  Chamber  which  the  Mohammedan <br/>guides  glibly  pronounce  to  be  a  shrine.  The  general  shape  of  this  niche,  however,  with  its  walls <br/>converging  by  a  series  of  overlaps  like  those  of  the  Grand  Gallery,  would  indicate  that  originally  it  had <br/>been  intended  as  a  passageway.  Efforts  made  to  explore  this  niche  have  been  nonproductive,  but  Mr. <br/>Dupre  believes  an  entrance  to  exist  here  through  which&#x2014;if  the  well  did  not  exist  at  the  time&#x2014;the <br/>workmen  made  their  exit  from  the  Pyramid  after  dropping  the  stone  plugs  into  the  ascending  gallery. <br/><br/>Biblical  scholars  have  contributed  a  number  of  most  extraordinary  conceptions  regarding  the  Great <br/>Pyramid.  This  ancient  edifice  has  been  identified  by  them  as  Joseph's  granary  (despite  its  hopelessly <br/>inadequate  capacity);  as  the  tomb  prepared  for  the  unfortunate  Pharaoh  of  the  Exodus  who  could  not <br/>be  buried  there  because  his  body  was  never  recovered  from  the  Red  Sea;  and  finally  as  a  perpetual <br/>confirmation  of  the  infallibility  of  the  numerous  prophecies  contained  in  the  Authorized  Version! <br/><br/>THE  SPHINX <br/><br/>Although  the  Great  Pyramid,  as  Ignatius  Donnelly  has  demonstrated,  is  patterned  after  an <br/>antediluvian  type  of  architecture,  examples  of  which  are  to  be  found  in  nearly  every  part  of  the  world, <br/>the  Sphinx  (Hu)  is  typically  Egyptian.  The  stele  between  its  paws  states  the  Sphinx  is  an  image  of  the <br/>Sun  God,  Harmackis,  which  was  evidently  made  in  the  similitude  of  the  Pharaoh  during  whose  reign <br/>it  was  chiseled.  The  statue  was  restored  and  completely  excavated  by  Tahutmes  IV  as  the  result  of  a <br/>vision  in  which  the  god  had  appeared  and  declared  himself  oppressed  by  the  weight  of  the  sand  about <br/>his  body.  The  broken  beard  of  the  Sphinx  was  discovered  during  excavations  between  the  front  paws. <br/>The  steps  leading  up  to  the  sphinx  and  also  the  temple  and  altar  between  the  paws  are  much  later <br/>additions,  probably  Roman,  for  it  is  known  that  the  Romans  reconstructed  many  Egyptian  antiquities. <br/>The  shallow  depression  in  the  crown  of  the  head,  once  thought  to  be  the  terminus  of  a  closed  up <br/>passageway  leading  from  the  Sphinx  to  the  Great  Pyramid,  was  merely  intended  to  help  support  a <br/>headdress  now  missing. <br/><br/>Metal  rods  have  been  driven  into  the  Sphinx  in  a  vain  effort  to  discover  chambers  or  passages  within <br/>its  body.  The  major  part  of  the  Sphinx  is  a  single  stone,  but  the  front  paws  have  been  built  up  of <br/>smaller  stones.  The  Sphinx  is  about  200  feet  long,  70  feet  high,  and  38  feet  wide  across  the  shoulders. <br/>The  main  stone  from  which  it  was  carved  is  believed  by  some  to  have  been  transported  from  distant <br/>quarries  by  methods  unknown,  while  others  assert  it  to  be  native  rock,  possibly  an  outcropping <br/>somewhat  resembling  the  form  into  which  it  was  later  carved.  The  theory  once  advanced  that  both  the <br/>Pyramid  and  the  Sphinx  were  built  from  artificial  stones  made  on  the  spot  has  been  abandoned.  A <br/>careful  analysis  of  the  limestone  shows  it  to  be  composed  of  small  sea  creatures  called  mummulites. <br/><br/>The  popular  supposition  that  the  Sphinx  was  the  true  portal  of  the  Great  Pyramid,  while  it  survives <br/>with  surprising  tenacity,  has  never  been  substantiated.  P.  Christian  presents  this  theory  as  follows, <br/>basing  it  in  part  upon  the  authority  of  lamblichus: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Sphinx  of  Gizeh,  says  the  author  of  the  Traite  des  Mysteres,  served  as  the  entrance  to  the  sacred <br/>subterranean  chambers  in  which  the  trials  of  the  initiate  were  undergone.  This  entrance,  obstructed <br/>in  our  day  by  sands  and  rubbish,  may  still  be  traced  between  the  forelegs  of  the  crouched  colossus.  It <br/>was  formerly  closed  by  a  bronze  gate  whose  secret  spring  could  be  operated  only  by  the  Magi.  It  was <br/>guarded  by  public  respect:  and  a  sort  of  religious  fear  maintained  its  inviolability  better  than  armed <br/>protection  would  have  done.  In  the  belly  of  the  Sphinx  were  cut  out  galleries  leading  to  the <br/>subterranean  part  of  the  Great  Pyramid.  These  galleries  were  so  artfully  crisscrossed  along  their <br/>course  to  the  Pyramid  that  in  setting  forth  into  the  passage  without  a  guide  through  this  network,  one <br/>ceaselessly  and  inevitably  returned  to  the  starting  point.&quot;  (See  Histoire  de  la  Magie.) <br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately,  the  bronze  door  referred  to  cannot  be  found,  nor  is  there  any  evidence  that  it  ever  existed.  The  passing  centuries  have <br/>wrought  many  changes  in  the  colossus,  however,  and  the  original  opening  may  have  been  closed. <br/><br/>Nearly  all  students  of  the  subject  believe  that  subterranean  chambers  exist  beneath  the  Great  Pyramid.  Robert  Ballard  writes:  &quot;The  priests <br/>of  the  Pyramids  of  Lake  Moeris  had  their  vast  subterranean  residences.  It  appears  to  me  more  than  probable  that  those  of  Gizeh  were <br/>similarly  provided.  And  I  may  go  further:~Out  of  these  very  caverns  may  have  been  excavated  the  limestone  of  which  the  Pyramids  were <br/>built.  *  *  *  In  the  bowels  of  the  limestone  ridge  on  which <br/><br/>P-43 <br/><br/><br/>VtriidSali  Sa-tij&gt;n/,  Iseidu  Wtst/, <br/>QftiAT  PYJtAMW <br/><br/>tit <br/><br/><br/>By    jtM^Mjjmi  ^it/. <br/><br/>^  .Ti-   '  &#x2014; J-  B&gt; <br/><br/><br/>A  VERTICAL  SECTION  OF  THE  GREAT  PYRAMID. <br/><br/><br/>From  Smyth's  Life  and  Wok  at  the  Great  Pyramid. <br/><br/><br/>The  Great  Pyramid  stands  upon  a  limestone  plateau  at  the  base  of  which,  according  to  ancient  history,  the  Nile  once <br/>flooded,  thus  supplying  a  method  for  the  huge  blocks  used  in  its  construction.  Presuming  that  the  capstone  as  originally  in <br/>place,  the  Pyramid  is,  according  to  John  Taylor,  in  round  figures  486  feet  high;  the  base  of  each  side  is  764  feet  long,  and <br/>the  entire  structure  covers  a  ground  area  of  more  than  13  acres. <br/><br/>The  Great  Pyramid  is  the  only  one  in  the  group  at  Gizeh~in  fact,  as  far  as  known,  the  only  one  in  Egypt&#x2014;that  has <br/>chambers  within  the  actual  body  of  the  Pyramid  itself  Far  this  reason  it  is  said  to  refute  the  Lepsius  Law,  which  asserts <br/>that  each  of  these  structures  is  a  monument  raised  over  a  subterranean  chamber  in  which  a  ruler  is  entombed.  The <br/>Pyramid  contains  four  chambers,  which  in  the  diagram  are  lettered  K,  H,  F,  and  O. <br/><br/>The  King's  Chamber  (K)  is  an  oblong  apartment  39  feet  long,  17  felt  wide,  and  19  feet  high  (disregarding  fractional  parts  of <br/>a  foot  in  each  case),  with  a  flat  roof  consisting  of  nine  great  stones,  the  largest  in  the  Pyramid.  Above  the  King's  Chamber <br/>are  five  low  compartments  (L),  generally  termed  construction  chambers.  In  the  lowest  of  these  the  so-called  hieroglj^hs <br/>of  the  Pharaoh  Cheops  are  located.  The  roof  of  the  fifth  construction  chamber  is  peaked.  At  the  end  of  the  King's  Chamber <br/>opposite  the  entrance  stands  the  famous  sarcophagus,  or  coffer  (I),  and  behind  it  is  a  shallow  opening  that  was  dug  in  the <br/>hope  of  discovering  valuables.  Two  air  vents  (M,  N)  passing  through  the  entire  body  of  the  Pyramid  ventilate  the  King's <br/>Chamber.  In  itself  this  is  sufficient  to  establish  that  the  building  was  not  intended  for  a  tomb. <br/><br/>Between  the  upper  end  of  the  Grand  Gallery  (G.  G.)  and  the  King's  Chamber  is  a  small  antechamber  (H),  its  extreme <br/>length  9  feet,  its  extreme  width  5  feet,  and  its  extreme  height  12  feet,  with  its  walls  grooved  far  purposes  now  unknown.  In <br/>the  groove  nearest  the  Grand  Gallery  is  a  slab  of  stone  in  two  sections,  with  a  peculiar  boss  or  knob  protruding  about  an <br/>inch  from  the  surface  of  the  upper  part  facing  the  Grand  Gallery.  This  stone  does  not  reach  to  the  floor  of  the  antechamber <br/>and  those  entering  the  King's  Chamber  must  pass  under  the  slab.  From  the  King's  Chamber,  the  Grand  Gallery&#x2014; 157  feet  in <br/>length,  28  feet  in  height,  7  feet  in  width  at  its  widest  point  and  decreasing  to  31/2  feet  as  the  result  of  seven  converging <br/>overlaps,  of  the  stones  forming  the  walls&#x2014; descends  to  a  little  above  the  level  of  the  Queen's  Chamber.  Here  a  gallery  (E) <br/>branches  off,  passing  mere  than  100  feet  back  towards  the  center  of  the  Pyramid  and  opening  into  the  Queen's  Chamber <br/>(F).  The  Queen's  Chamber  is  19  feet  long,  17  feet  wide,  and  20  feet  high.  Its  roof  is  peaked  and  composed  of  great  slabs  of <br/>stone.  Air  passages  not  shown  lead  from  the  Queen's  Chamber,  but  these  were  not  open  originally.  In  the  east  wall  of  the <br/>Queen's  Chamber  is  a  peculiar  niche  of  gradually  converging  stone,  which  in  all  likelihood,  may  prove  to  be  a  new  lost <br/>entrance  way. <br/><br/>At  the  paint  where  the  Grand  Gallery  ends  and  the  horizontal  passage  towards  the  Queen's  Chamber  begins  is  the <br/>entrance  to  the  well  and  also  the  opening  leading  down  the  first  ascending  passage  (D)  to  the  point  where  this  passage <br/>meets  the  descending  passage  (A)  leading  from  the  outer  wall  of  the  Pyramid  down  to  the  subterranean  chamber.  After <br/>descending  59  feet  down  the  well  (P),  the  grotto  is  reached.  Continuing  through  the  floor  of  the  grotto  the  well  leads <br/>downward  133  feet  to  the  descending  entrance  passage  (A),  which  it  meets  a  short  distance  before  this  passage  becomes <br/>horizontal  and  leads  into  the  subterranean  chamber. <br/><br/>The  subterranean  chamber  (O)  is  about  46  feet  long  and  27  feet  wide,  but  is  extremely  low,  the  ceiling  varying  in  height <br/>from  a  little  over  3  feet  to  about  13  feet  fi-om  the  rough  and  apparently  unflnished  floor.  From  the  south  side  of  the <br/>subterranean  chamber  a  low  tunnel  runs  about  50  feet  and  then  meets  a  blank  wall.  These  constitute  the  only  known <br/>openings  in  the  Pyramid,  with  the  exception  of  a  few  niches,  exploration  holes,  blind  passages,  and  the  rambling <br/>cavernous  tunnel  (B)  hewn  out  by  the  Moslems  under  the  leadership  of  the  Prophet's  descendant.  Caliph  al  Mamoun. <br/><br/><br/>the  Pyramids  are  built  will  yet  be  found,  I  feel  convinced,  ample  information  as  to  their  uses.  A  good <br/>diamond  drill  with  two  or  three  hundred  feet  of  rods  is  what  is  wanted  to  test  this,  and  the  solidarity <br/>of  the  Pyramids  at  the  same  time.&quot;  (See  The  Solution  of  the  Pyramid  Problem.) <br/><br/>Mr.  Ballard's  theory  of  extensive  underground  apartments  and  quarries  brings  up  an  important <br/>problem  in  architectonics.  The  Pyramid  builders  were  too  farsighted  to  endanger  the  permanence  of <br/>the  Great  Pyramid  by  placing  over  five  million  tons  of  limestone  and  granite  on  any  but  a  solid <br/>foundation.  It  is  therefore  reasonably  certain  that  such  chambers  or  passageways  as  may  exist <br/>beneath  the  building  are  relatively  insignificant,  like  those  within  the  body  of  the  structure,  which <br/>occupy  less  than  one  sixteen-hundredth  of  the  cubic  contents  of  the  Pyramid. <br/><br/>The  Sphinx  was  undoubtedly  erected  for  symbolical  purposes  at  the  instigation  of  the  priestcraft.  The <br/>theories  that  the  urseus  upon  its  forehead  was  originally  the  finger  of  an  immense  sundial  and  that <br/><br/><br/>both  the  Pyramid  and  the  Sphinx  were  used  to  measure  time,  the  seasons,  and  the  precession  of  the <br/>equinoxes  are  ingenious  but  not  wholly  convincing.  If  this  great  creature  was  erected  to  obliterate  the <br/>ancient  passageway  leading  into  the  subterranean  temple  of  the  Pyramid,  its  symbolism  would  be <br/>most  appropriate.  In  comparison  with  the  overwhelming  size  and  dignity  of  the  Great  Pyramid,  the <br/>Sphinx  is  almost  insignificant.  Its  battered  face,  upon  which  may  still  be  seen  vestiges  of  the  red  paint <br/>with  which  the  figure  was  originally  covered,  is  disfigured  beyond  recognition.  Its  nose  was  broken  off <br/>by  a  fanatical  Mohammedan,  lest  the  followers  of  the  Prophet  be  led  into  idolatry.  The  very  nature  of <br/>its  construction  and  the  present  repairs  necessary  to  prevent  the  head  from  falling  off  indicate  that  it <br/>could  not  have  survived  the  great  periods  of  time  which  have  elapsed  since  the  erection  of  the <br/>Pyramid. <br/><br/>To  the  Egyptians,  the  Sphinx  was  the  symbol  of  strength  and  intelligence.  It  was  portrayed  as <br/>androgynous  to  signify  that  they  recognized  the  initiates  and  gods  as  partaking  of  both  the  positive <br/>and  negative  creative  powers.  Gerald  Massey  writes:  &quot;This  is  the  secret  of  the  Sphinx.  The  orthodox <br/>sphinx  of  Egypt  is  masculine  in  front  and  feminine  behind.  So  is  the  image  of  Sut-Typhon,  a  type  of <br/>horn  and  tail,  male  in  front  and  female  behind.  The  Pharaohs,  who  wore  the  tail  of  the  Lioness  or  Cow <br/>behind  them,  were  male  in  front  and  female  behind.  Like  the  Gods  they  included  the  dual  totality  of <br/>Being  in  one  person,  born  of  the  Mother,  but  of  both  sexes  as  the  Child.&quot;  (See  The  Natural  Genesis.) <br/><br/>Most  investigators  have  ridiculed  the  Sphinx  and,  without  even  deigning  to  investigate  the  great <br/>colossus,  have  turned  their  attention  to  the  more  overwhelming  mystery  of  the  Pyramid. <br/><br/>THE  PYRAMID  MYSTERIES <br/><br/>The  word  pyramid  is  popularly  supposed  to  be  derived  from  nvp,  fire,  thus  signifying  that  it  is  the <br/>symbolic  representation  of  the  One  Divine  Flame,  the  life  of  every  creature.  John  Taylor  believes  the <br/>word  pyramid  to  mean  a  &quot;measure  of  wheat,  &quot;  while  C.  Piazzi  Smyth  favors  the  Coptic  meaning,  &quot;a <br/>division  into  ten.&quot;  The  initiates  of <br/><br/>p-44 <br/><br/>old  accepted  the  pyramid  form  as  the  ideal  symbol  of  both  the  secret  doctrine  and  those  institutions <br/>established  for  its  dissemination.  Both  pyramids  and  mounds  are  antitypes  of  the  Holy  Mountain,  or <br/>High  Place  of  God,  which  was  believed  to  stand  in  the  &quot;midst&quot;  of  the  earth.  John  P.  Lundy  relates  the <br/>Great  Pyramid  to  the  fabled  Olympus,  further  assuming  that  its  subterranean  passages  correspond  to <br/>the  tortuous  byways  of  Hades. <br/><br/>The  square  base  of  the  Pyramid  is  a  constant  reminder  that  the  House  of  Wisdom  is  firmly  founded <br/>upon  Nature  and  her  immutable  laws.  &quot;The  Gnostics,&quot;  writes  Albert  Pike,  &quot;claimed  that  the  whole <br/>edifice  of  their  science  rested  on  a  square  whose  angles  were:  Siyr),  Silence;  BuGog,  Profundity;  Noug, <br/>Intelligence;  and  AXriGeia  Truth.&quot;  (See  Morals  and  Dogma.)  The  sides  of  the  Great  Pyramid  face  the <br/>four  cardinal  angles,  the  latter  signifying  according  to  Eliphas  Levi  the  extremities  of  heat  and  cold <br/>(south  and  north)  and  the  extremities  of  light  and  darkness  (east  and  west).  The  base  of  the  Pyramid <br/>further  represents  the  four  material  elements  or  substances  from  the  combinations  of  which  the <br/>quaternary  body  of  man  is  formed.  From  each  side  of  the  square  there  rises  a  triangle,  typifying  the <br/>threefold  divine  being  enthroned  within  every  quaternary  material  nature.  If  each  base  line  be <br/>considered  a  square  from  which  ascends  a  threefold  spiritual  power,  then  the  sum  of  the  lines  of  the <br/>four  faces  (12)  and  the  four  hypothetical  squares  (16)  constituting  the  base  is  28,  the  sacred  number <br/>of  the  lower  world.  If  this  be  added  to  the  three  septenaries  composing  the  sun  (21),  it  equals  49,  the <br/>square  of  7  and  the  number  of  the  universe. <br/><br/>The  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac,  like  the  Governors'  of  the  lower  worlds,  are  symbolized  by  the  twelve <br/>lines  of  the  four  triangles&#x2014;the  faces  of  the  Pyramid.  In  the  midst  of  each  face  is  one  of  the  beasts  of <br/><br/><br/>Ezekiel,  and  the  structure  as  a  whole  becomes  the  Cherubim.  The  three  main  chambers  of  the <br/><br/>Pyramid  are  related  to  the  heart,  the  brain,  and  the  generative  system&#x2014;the  spiritual  centers  of  the <br/>human  constitution.  The  triangular  form  of  the  Pyramid  also  is  similar  to  the  posture  assumed  by  the <br/>body  during  the  ancient  meditative  exercises.  The  Mysteries  taught  that  the  divine  energies  from  the <br/>gods  descended  upon  the  top  of  the  Pyramid,  which  was  likened  to  an  inverted  tree  with  its  branches <br/>below  and  its  roots  at  the  apex.  From  this  inverted  tree  the  divine  wisdom  is  disseminated  by <br/>streaming  down  the  diverging  sides  and  radiating  throughout  the  world. <br/><br/>The  size  of  the  capstone  of  the  Great  Pyramid  cannot  be  accurately  determined,  for,  while  most <br/>investigators  have  assumed  that  it  was  once  in  place,  no  vestige  of  it  now  remains.  There  is  a  curious <br/>tendency  among  the  builders  of  great  religious  edifices  to  leave  their  creations  unfinished,  thereby <br/>signifying  that  God  alone  is  complete.  The  capstone&#x2014;if  it  existed&#x2014; was  itself  a  miniature  pyramid,  the <br/>apex  of  which  again  would  be  capped  by  a  smaller  block  of  similar  shape,  and  so  on  ad  infinitum.  The <br/>capstone  therefore  is  the  epitome  of  the  entire  structure.  Thus,  the  Pyramid  may  be  likened  to  the <br/>universe  and  the  capstone  to  man.  Following  the  chain  of  analogy,  the  mind  is  the  capstone  of  man, <br/>the  spirit  the  capstone  of  the  mind,  and  God&#x2014; the  epitome  of  the  whole&#x2014; the  capstone  of  the  spirit.  As <br/>a  rough  and  unfinished  block,  man  is  taken  from  the  quarry  and  by  the  secret  culture  of  the  Mysteries <br/>gradually  transformed  into  a  trued  and  perfect  pyramidal  capstone.  The  temple  is  complete  only <br/>when  the  initiate  himself  becomes  the  living  apex  through  which  the  divine  power  is  focused  into  the <br/>diverging  structure  below. <br/><br/>W.  Marsham  Adams  calls  the  Great  Pyramid  &quot;the  House  of  the  Hidden  Places&quot;;  such  indeed  it  was, <br/>for  it  represented  the  inner  sanctuary  of  pre-Egyptian  wisdom.  By  the  Egyptians  the  Great  Pyramid <br/>was  associated  with  Hermes,  the  god  of  wisdom  and  letters  and  the  Divine  Illuminator  worshiped <br/>through  the  planet  Mercury.  Relating  Hermes  to  the  Pyramid  emphasizes  anew  the  fact  that  it  was  in <br/>reality  the  supreme  temple  of  the  Invisible  and  Supreme  Deity.  The  Great  Pyramid  was  not  a <br/>lighthouse,  an  observatory,  or  a  tomb,  but  the  first  temple  of  the  Mysteries,  the  first  structure  erected <br/>as  a  repository  for  those  secret  truths  which  are  the  certain  foundation  of  all  arts  and  sciences.  It  was <br/>the  perfect  emblem  of  the  microcosm  and  the  macrocosm  and,  according  to  the  secret  teachings,  the <br/>tomb  of  Osiris,  the  black  god  of  the  Nile.  Osiris  represents  a  certain  manifestation  of  solar  energy,  and <br/>therefore  his  house  or  tomb  is  emblematic  of  the  universe  within  which  he  is  entombed  and  upon  the <br/>cross  of  which  he  is  crucified. <br/><br/>Through  the  mystic  passageways  and  chambers  of  the  Great  Pyramid  passed  the  illumined  of <br/>antiquity.  They  entered  its  portals  as  men;  they  came  forth  as  gods.  It  was  the  place  of  the  &quot;second <br/>birth,&quot;  the  &quot;womb  of  the  Mysteries,&quot;  and  wisdom  dwelt  in  it  as  God  dwells  in  the  hearts  of  men. <br/>Somewhere  in  the  depths  of  its  recesses  there  resided  an  unknown  being  who  was  called  &quot;The <br/>Initiator,&quot;  or  &quot;The  Illustrious  One,&quot;  robed  in  blue  and  gold  and  bearing  in  his  hand  the  sevenfold  key <br/>of  Eternity.  This  was  the  lion-faced  hierophant,  the  Holy  One,  the  Master  of  Masters,  who  never  left <br/>the  House  of  Wisdom  and  whom  no  man  ever  saw  save  he  who  had  passed  through  the  gates  of <br/>preparation  and  purification.  It  was  in  these  chambers  that  Plato&#x2014; he  of  the  broad  brow &#x2014; came  face <br/>to  face  with  the  wisdom  of  the  ages  personified  in  the  Master  of  the  Hidden  House. <br/><br/>Who  was  the  Master  dwelling  in  the  mighty  Pyramid,  the  many  rooms  of  which  signified  the  worlds  in <br/>space;  the  Master  whom  none  might  behold  save  those  who  had  been  &quot;born  again&quot;?  He  alone  fully <br/>knew  the  secret  of  the  Pyramid,  but  he  has  departed  the  way  of  the  wise  and  the  house  is  empty.  The <br/>hymns  of  praise  no  longer  echo  in  muffled  tones  through  the  chambers;  the  neophyte  no  longer <br/>passes  through  the  elements  and  wanders  among  the  seven  stars;  the  candidate  no  longer  receives  the <br/>&quot;Word  of  Life&quot;  from  the  lips  of  the  Eternal  One.  Nothing  now  remains  that  the  eye  of  man  can  see  but <br/>an  empty  shell&#x2014; the  outer  symbol  of  an  inner  truth&#x2014; and  men  call  the  House  of  God  a  tomb! <br/><br/>The  technique  of  the  Mysteries  was  unfolded  by  the  Sage  Illuminator,  the  Master  of  the  Secret  House. <br/>The  power  to  know  his  guardian  spirit  was  revealed  to  the  new  initiate;  the  method  of  disentangling <br/><br/><br/>his  material  body  from,  his  divine  vehicle  was  explained;  and  to  consummate  the  magnum  opus, <br/>there  was  revealed  the  Divine  Name&#x2014;the  secret  and  unutterable  designation  of  the  Supreme  Deity,  by <br/>the  very  knowledge  of  which  man  and  his  God  are  made  consciously  one.  With  the  giving  of  the  Name, <br/>the  new  initiate  became  himself  a  pyramid,  within  the  chambers  of  whose  soul  numberless  other <br/>human  beings  might  also  receive  spiritual  enlightenment. <br/><br/>In  the  King's  Chamber  was  enacted  the  drama  of  the  &quot;second  death.&quot;  Here  the  candidate,  after  being <br/>crucified  upon  the  cross  of  the  solstices  and  the  equinoxes,  was  buried  in  the  great  coffer.  There  is  a <br/>profound  mystery  to  the  atmosphere  and  temperature  of  the  King's  Chamber:  it  is  of  a  peculiar <br/>deathlike  cold  which  cuts  to  the  marrow  of  the  bone.  This  room  was  a  doorway  between  the  material <br/>world  and  the  transcendental  spheres  of  Nature.  While  his  body  lay  in  the  coffer,  the  soul  of  the <br/>neophyte  soared  as  a  human-headed  hawk  through  the  celestial  realms,  there  to  discover  first  hand <br/>the  eternity  of  Life,  Light,  and  Truth,  as  well  as  the  illusion  of  Death,  Darkness,  and  Sin.  Thus  in  one <br/>sense  the  Great  Pyramid  may  be  likened  to  a  gate  through  which  the  ancient  priests  permitted  a  few <br/>to  pass  toward  the  attainment  of  individual  completion.  It  is  also  to  be  noted  incidentally  that  if  the <br/>coffer  in  the  King's  Chamber  be  struck,  the  sound  emitted  has  no  counterpart  in  any  known  musical <br/>scale.  This  tonal  value  may  have  formed  part  of  that  combination  of  circumstances  which  rendered <br/>the  King's  Chamber  an  ideal  setting  for  the  conferment  of  the  highest  degree  of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>The  modern  world  knows  little  of  these  ancient  rites.  The  scientist  and  the  theologian  alike  gaze  upon <br/>the  sacred  structure,  wondering  what  fundamental  urge  inspired  the  herculean  labor.  If  they  would <br/>but  think  for  a  moment,  they  would  realize  that  there  is  only  one  urge  in  the  soul  of  man  capable  of <br/>supplying  the  required  incentive&#x2014;namely,  the  desire  to  know,  to  understand,  and  to  exchange  the <br/>narrowness  of  human  mortality  for  the  greater  breadth  and  scope  of  divine  enlightenment.  So  men <br/>say  of  the  Great  Pjramid  that  it  is  the  most  perfect  building  in  the  world,  the  source  of  weights  and <br/>measures,  the  original  Noah's  Ark,  the  origin  of  languages,  alphabets,,  and  scales  of  temperature  and <br/>humidity.  Few  realize,  however,  that  it  is  the  gateway  to  the  Eternal. <br/><br/>Though  the  modern  world  may  know  a  million  secrets,  the  ancient  world  knew  one&#x2014; and  that  one  was <br/>greater  than  the  million;  for  the  million  secrets  breed  death,  disaster,  sorrow,  selfishness,  lust,  and <br/>avarice,  but  the  one  secret  confers  life,  light,  and  truth.  The  time  will  come  when  the  secret  wisdom <br/>shall  again  be  the  dominating  religious  and  philosophical  urge  of  the  world.  The  day  is  at  hand  when <br/>the  doom  of  dogma  shall  be  sounded.  The  great  theological  Tower  of  Babel,  with  its  confusion  of <br/>tongues,  was  built  of  bricks  of  mud  and  the  mortar  of  slime.  Out  of  the  cold  ashes  of  lifeless  creeds, <br/>however,  shall  rise  phoenixlike  the  ancient  Mysteries.  No  other  institution  has  so  completely  satisfied <br/>the  religious  aspirations  of  humanity,  for  since  the  destruction  of  the  Mysteries  there  never  has  been  a <br/>religious  code  to  which  Plato  could  have  subscribed.  The  unfolding  of  man's  spiritual  nature  is  as <br/>much  an  exact  science  as  astronomy,  medicine  or  jurisprudence.  To  accomplish  this  end  religions <br/>were  primarily  established;  and  out  of  religion  have  come  science,  philosophy,  and  logic  as  methods <br/>whereby  this  divine  purpose  might  be  realized. <br/><br/>The  Dying  God  shall  rise  again!  The  secret  room  in  the  House  of  the  Hidden  Places  shall  be <br/>rediscovered.  The  Pyramid  again  shall  stand  as  the  ideal  emblem  of  solidarity,  inspiration,  aspiration, <br/>resurrection,  and  regeneration.  As  the  passing  sands  of  time  bury  civilization  upon  civilization <br/>beneath  their  weight,  the  Pyramid  shall  remain  as  the  Visible  covenant  between  Eternal  Wisdom  and <br/>the  world.  The  time  may  yet  come  when  the  chants  of  the  illumined  shall  be  heard  once  more  in  its <br/>ancient  passageways  and  the  Master  of  the  Hidden  House  shall  await  in  the  Silent  Place  for  the <br/>coming  of  that  man  who,  casting  aside  the  fallacies  of  dogma  and  tenet,  seeks  simply  Truth  and  will <br/>be  satisfied  with  neither  substitute  nor  counterfeit. <br/><br/><br/>p-45 <br/><br/><br/>Isis,  the  Virgin  of  the  World <br/><br/>IT  is  especially  fitting  that  a  study  of  Hermetic  symbolism  should  begin  with  a  discussion  of  the <br/>symbols  and  attributes  of  the  Saitic  Isis.  This  is  the  Isis  of  Sais,  famous  for  the  inscription  concerning <br/>her  which  appeared  on  the  front  of  her  temple  in  that  city:  &quot;I,  Isis,  am  all  that  has  been,  that  is  or <br/>shall  be;  no  mortal  Man  hath  ever  me  unveiled.&quot; <br/><br/>Plutarch  affirms  that  many  ancient  authors  believed  this  goddess  to  be  the  daughter  of  Hermes; <br/>others  held  the  opinion  that  she  was  the  child  of  Prometheus.  Both  of  these  demigods  were  noted  for <br/>their  divine  wisdom.  It  is  not  improbable  that  her  kinship  to  them  is  merely  allegorical.  Plutarch <br/>translates  the  name  Isis  to  mean  wisdom.  Godfrey  Higgins,  in  his  Anacalypsis,  derives  the  name  of <br/>Isis  from  the  Hebrew      Iso,  and  the  Greek  ^coco,  to  save.  Some  authorities,  however,  for  example, <br/>Richard  Payne  Knight  (as  stated  in  his  Symbolical  Language  of  Ancient  Art  and  Mythology),  believe <br/>the  word  to  be  of  Northern  extraction,  possibly  Scandinavian  or  Gothic.  In  these  languages  the  name <br/>is  pronounced  Isa,  meaning  ice,  or  water  in  its  most  passive,  crystallized,  negative  state. <br/><br/>This  Egyptian  deity  under  many  names  appears  as  the  principle  of  natural  fecundity  among  nearly  all <br/>the  religions  of  the  ancient  world.  She  was  known  as  the  goddess  with  ten  thousand  appellations  and <br/>was  metamorphosed  by  Christianity  into  the  Virgin  Mary,  for  Isis,  although  she  gave  birth  to  all  living <br/>things&#x2014;chief  among  them  the  Sun&#x2014;still  remained  a  virgin,  according  to  the  legendary  accounts. <br/><br/>Apuleius  in  the  eleventh  book  of  The  Golden  Ass  ascribes  to  the  goddess  the  following  statement <br/><br/>concerning  her  powers  and  attributes:  &quot;Behold,  *  *,  I,  moved  by  thy  prayers,  am  present  with  thee;  I, <br/>who  am  Nature,  the  parent  of  things,  the  queen  of  all  the  elements,  the  primordial  progeny  of  ages, <br/>the  supreme  of  Divinities,  the  sovereign  of  the  spirits  of  the  dead,  the  first  of  the  celestials,  and  the <br/>uniform  resemblance  of  Gods  and  Goddesses.  I,  who  rule  by  my  nod  the  luminous  summits  of  the <br/>heavens,  the  salubrious  breezes  of  the  sea,  and  the  deplorable  silences  of  the  realms  beneath,  and <br/>whose  one  divinity  the  whole  orb  of  the  earth  venerates  under  a  manifold  form,  by  different  rites  and <br/>a  variety  of  appellations.  Hence  the  primogenial  Phrygians  call  me  Pessinuntica,  the  mother  of  the <br/>Gods,  the  Attic  Aborigines,  Cecropian  Minerva;  the  floating  Cyprians,  Paphian  Venus;  the  arrow- <br/>bearing  Cretans,  Diana  Dictynna;  the  three-tongued  Sicilians,  Stygian  Proserpine;  and  the <br/>Eleusinians,  the  ancient  Goddess  Ceres.  Some  also  call  me  Juno,  others  Bellona,  others  Hecate,  and <br/>others  Rhamnusia.  And  those  who  are  illuminated  by  the  incipient  rays  of  that  divinity  the  Sun,  when <br/>he  rises,  viz.  the  Ethiopians,  the  Arii,  and  the  Egyptians  skilled  in  ancient  learning,  worshipping  me <br/>by  ceremonies  perfectly  appropriate,  call  me  by  my  true  name.  Queen  Isis.&quot; <br/><br/>Le  Plongeon  believes  that  the  Egyptian  myth  of  Isis  had  a  historical  basis  among  the  Mayas  of  Central <br/>America,  where  this  goddess  was  known  as  Queen  Moo.  In  Prince  Coh  the  same  author  finds  a <br/>correspondence  to  Osiris,  the  brother-husband  of  Isis.  Le  Plongeon's  theory  is  that  Mayan  civilization <br/>was  far  more  ancient  than  that  of  Egypt.  After  the  death  of  Prince  Coh,  his  widow.  Queen  Moo,  fleeing <br/>to  escape  the  wrath  of  his  murderers,  sought  refuge  among  the  Mayan  colonies  in  Egypt,  where  she <br/>was  accepted  as  their  queen  and  was  given  the  name  of  Isis.  While  Le  Plongeon  may  be  right,  the <br/>possible  historical  queen  sinks  into  insignificance  when  compared  with  the  allegorical,  symbolic <br/>World  Virgin;  and  the  fact  that  she  appears  among  so  many  different  races  and  peoples  discredits  the <br/>theory  that  she  was  a  historical  individual. <br/><br/>According  to  Sextus  Empyricus,  the  Trojan  war  was  fought  over  a  statue  of  the  moon  goddess.  For <br/>this  lunar  Helena,  and  not  for  a  woman,  the  Greeks  and  Trojans  struggled  at  the  gates  of  Troy. <br/><br/><br/>Several  authors  have  attempted  to  prove  that  Isis,  Osiris,  Typhon,  Nephthys,  and  Aroueris  (Thoth,  or <br/>Mercury)  were  grandchildren  of  the  great  Jewish  patriarch  Noah  by  his  son  Ham.  But  as  the  story  of <br/>Noah  and  his  ark  is  a  cosmic  allegory  concerning  the  repopulation  of  planets  at  the  beginning  of  each <br/>world  period,  this  only  makes  it  less  likely  that  they  were  historical  personages.  According  to  Robert <br/>Fludd,  the  sun  has  three  properties~/i/e,  light,  and  heat.  These  three  vivify  and  vitalize  the  three <br/>worlds&#x2014;spiritual,  intellectual,  and  material.  Therefore,  it  is  said  &quot;from  one  light,  three  lights,&quot;  i.  e.  the <br/>first  three  Master  Masons.  In  all  probability,  Osiris  represents  the  third,  or  material,  aspect  of  solar <br/>activity,  which  by  its  beneficent  influences  vitalizes  and  enlivens  the  flora  and  fauna  of  the  earth. <br/>Osiris  is  not  the  sun,  but  the  sun  is  symbolic  of  the  vital  principle  of  Nature,  which  the  ancients  knew <br/>as  Osiris.  His  symbol,  therefore,  was  an  opened  eye,  in  honor  of  the  Great  Eye  of  the  universe,  the  sun, <br/>Opposed  to  the  active,  radiant  principle  of  impregnating  fire,  hear,  and  motion  was  the  passive, <br/>receptive  principle  of  Nature. <br/><br/>Modern  science  has  proved  that  forms  ranging  in  magnitude  from  solar  systems  to  atoms  are <br/>composed  of  positive,  radiant  nuclei  surrounded  by  negative  bodies  that  exist  upon  the  emanations  of <br/>the  central  life.  From  this  allegory  we  have  the  story  of  Solomon  and  his  wives,  for  Solomon  is  the  sun <br/>and  his  wives  and  concubines  are  the  planets,  moons,  asteroids,  and  other  receptive  bodies  within  his <br/>house&#x2014;the  solar  mansion.  Isis,  represented  in  the  Song  of  Solomon  by  the  dark  maid  of  Jerusalem,  is <br/>symbolic  of  receptive  Nature&#x2014; the  watery,  maternal  principle  which  creates  all  things  out  of  herself <br/>after  impregnation  has  been  achieved  by  the  virility  of  the  sun. <br/><br/>In  the  ancient  world  the  year  had  360  days.  The  five  extra  days  were  gathered  together  by  the  God  of <br/>Cosmic  Intelligence  to  serve  as  the  birthdays  of  the  five  gods  and  goddesses  who  are  called  the  sons <br/>and  daughters  of  Ham.  Upon  the  first  of  these  special  days  Osiris  was  born  and  upon  the  fourth  of <br/>them  Isis.  (The  number /our  shows  the  relation  that  this  goddess  bears  to  the  earth  and  its  elements.) <br/>Typhon,  the  Egyptian  Demon  or  Spirit  of  the  Adversary,  was  born  upon  the  third  day.  Typhon  is  often <br/>symbolized  by  a  crocodile;  sometimes  his  body  is  a  combination  of  crocodile  and  hog.  Isis  stands  for <br/>knowledge  and  wisdom,  and  according  to  Plutarch  the  word  Typhon  means  insolence  and  pride. <br/>Egotism,  self-centeredness,  and  pride  are  the  deadly  enemies  of  understanding  and  truth.  This  part  of <br/>the  allegory  is  revealed. <br/><br/>After  Osiris,  here  symbolized  as  the  sun,  had  become  King  of  Egypt  and  had  given  to  his  people  the <br/>full  advantage  of  his  intellectual  light,  he  continued  his  path  through  the  heavens,  visiting  the  peoples <br/>of  other  nations  and  converting  all  with  whom  he  came  in  contact.  Plutarch  further  asserts  that  the <br/>Greeks  recognized  in  Osiris  the  same  person  whom  they  revered  under  the  names  of  Dionysos  and <br/>Bacchus.  While  he  was  away  from  his  country,  his  brother,  Typhon,  the  Evil  One,  like  the  Loki  of <br/>Scandinavia,  plotted  against  the  Sun  God  to  destroy  him.  Gathering  seventy-two  persons  as  fellow <br/>conspirators,  he  attained  his  nefarious  end  in  a  most  subtle  manner.  He  had  a  wonderful  ornamented <br/>box  made  just  the  size  of  the  body  of  Osiris.  This  he  brought  into  a  banquet  hall  where  the  gods  and <br/>goddesses  were  feasting  together.  All  admired  the  beautiful  chest,  and  Typhon  promised  to  give  it  to <br/>the  one  whose  body  fitted  it  most  perfectly.  One  after  another  lay  down  in  the  box,  but  in <br/>disappointment <br/><br/><br/>ISIS,  QUEEN  OF  HEAVEN. <br/><br/><br/>From  Mosaize  Historie  der  Hebreeuwse  Kerke. <br/><br/>Diodorus  writes  of  a  famous  inscription  carved  on  a  column  at  Nysa,  in  Arabia,  wherein  Isis  described  herself  as  follows: <br/>&quot;I  am  Isis,  Queen  of  this  country.  I  was  instructed  by  Mercury.  No  one  can  destroy  the  laws  which  I  have  established.  I  am <br/>the  eldest  daughter  of  Saturn,  most  ancient  of  the  gods.  I  am  the  wife  and  sister  of  Osiris  the  King.  I  first  made  known  to <br/>mortals  the  use  of  wheat.  I  am  the  mother  of  Orus  the  King.  In  my  honor  was  the  city  of  Bubaste  built.  Rejoice,  O  Egypt, <br/>rejoice,  land  that  gave  me  birth!&quot;  (See  &quot;Morals  and  Dogma,&quot;  by  Albert  Pike.) <br/><br/>p.  46 <br/><br/>rose  again,  until  at  last  Osiris  also  tried.  The  moment  he  was  in  the  chest  Typhon  and  his  accomplices <br/><br/>nailed  the  cover  down  and  sealed  the  cracks  wdth  molten  lead.  They  then  cast  the  box  into  the  Nile, <br/>down  which  it  floated  to  the  sea.  Plutarch  states  that  the  date  upon  which  this  occurred  was  the <br/>seventeenth  day  of  the  month  Athyr,  when  the  sun  was  in  the  constellation  of  Scorpio.  This  is  most <br/><br/><br/>significant,  for  the  Scorpion  is  the  symbol  of  treachery.  The  time  when  Osiris  entered  the  chest  was <br/>also  the  same  season  that  Noah  entered  the  ark  to  escape  from  the  Deluge. <br/><br/>Plutarch  further  declares  that  the  Pans  and  Satyrs  (the  Nature  spirits  and  elementals)  first  discovered <br/>that  Osiris  had  been  murdered.  These  immediately  raised  an  alarm,  and  from  this  incident  the  word <br/>panic,  meaningfright  or  amazement  of  the  multitudes,  originated.  Isis,  upon  receiving  the  news  of <br/>her  husband's  murder,  which  she  learned  from  some  children  who  had  seen  the  murderers  making  off <br/>with  the  box,  at  once  robed  herself  in  mourning  and  started  forth  in  quest  of  him. <br/><br/>At  length  Isis  discovered  that  the  chest  had  floated  to  the  coast  of  Byblos.  There  it  had  lodged  in  the <br/>branches  of  a  tree,  which  in  a  short  time  miraculously  grew  up  around  the  box.  This  so  amazed  the <br/>king  of  that  country  that  he  ordered  the  tree  to  be  cut  down  and  a  pillar  made  from  its  trunk  to <br/>support  the  roof  of  his  palace.  Isis,  visiting  Byblos,  recovered  the  body  of  her  husband,  but  it  was <br/>again  stolen  by  Typhon,  who  cut  it  into  fourteen  parts,  which  he  scattered  all  over  the  earth.  Isis,  in <br/>despair,  began  gathering  up  the  severed  remains  of  her  husband,  but  found  only  thirteen  pieces.  The <br/>fourteenth  part  (the  phallus)  she  reproduced  in  gold,  for  the  original  had  fallen  into  the  river  Nile  and <br/>had  been  swallowed  by  a  fish. <br/><br/>Typhon  was  later  slain  in  battle  by  the  son  of  Osiris.  Some  of  the  Egyptians  believed  that  the  souls  of <br/>the  gods  were  taken  to  heaven,  where  they  shone  forth  as  stars.  It  was  supposed  that  the  soul  of  Isis <br/>gleamed  from  the  Dog  Star,  while  Typhon  became  the  constellation  of  the  Bear.  It  is  doubtful, <br/>however,  whether  this  idea  was  ever  generally  accepted. <br/><br/>Among  the  Egyptians,  Isis  is  often  represented  with  a  headdress  consisting  of  the  empty  throne  chair <br/>of  her  murdered  husband,  and  this  peculiar  structure  was  accepted  during  certain  dynasties  as  her <br/>hieroglyphic.  The  headdresses  of  the  Egyptians  have  great  symbolic  and  emblematic  importance,  for <br/>they  represent  the  auric  bodies  of  the  superhuman  intelligences,  and  are  used  in  the  same  way  that <br/>the  nimbus,  halo,  and  aureole  are  used  in  Christian  religious  art.  Frank  C.  Higgins,  a  well-known <br/>Masonic  symbolist,  has  astutely  noted  that  the  ornate  headgears  of  certain  gods  and  Pharaohs  are <br/>inclined  backward  at  the  same  angle  as  the  earth's  axis.  The  robes,  insignia,  jewels,  and <br/>ornamentations  of  the  ancient  hierophants  symbolized  the  spiritual  energies  radiating  from  the <br/>human  body.  Modern  science  is  rediscovering  many  of  the  lost  secrets  of  Hermetic  philosophy.  One  of <br/>these  is  the  ability  to  gauge  the  mental  development,  the  soul  qualities,  and  the  physical  health  of  an <br/>individual  from  the  streamers  of  semi-visible  electric  force  which  pour  through  the  surface  of  the  skin <br/>of  every  human  being  at  all  times  during  his  life.  (For  details  concerning  a  scientific  process  for <br/>making  the  auric  emanations  visible,  see  The  Human  Atmosphere  by  Dr.  Walter  J.  Kilner.) <br/><br/>Isis  is  sometimes  symbolized  by  the  head  of  a  cow;  occasionally  the  entire  animal  is  her  symbol.  The <br/>first  gods  of  the  Scandinavians  were  licked  out  of  blocks  of  ice  by  the  Mother  Cow  (Audhumla),  who <br/>symbolized  the  principle  of  natural  nutriment  and  fecundity  because  of  her  milk.  Occasionally  Isis  is <br/>represented  as  a  bird.  She  often  carries  in  one  hand  the  crux  ansata,  the  symbol  of  eternal  life,  and  in <br/>the  other  the  flowered  scepter,  symbolic  of  her  authority. <br/><br/>Thoth  Hermes  Trismegistus,  the  founder  of  Egyptian  learning,  the  Wise  Man  of  the  ancient  world, <br/>gave  to  the  priests  and  philosophers  of  antiquity  the  secrets  which  have  been  preserved  to  this  day  in <br/>myth  and  legend.  These  allegories  and  emblematic  figures  conceal  the  secret  formulae  for  spiritual, <br/>mental,  moral,  and  physical  regeneration  commonly  known  as  the  Mystic  Chemistry  of  the  Soul <br/>(alchemy).  These  sublime  truths  were  communicated  to  the  initiates  of  the  Mystery  Schools,  but  were <br/>concealed  from  the  profane.  The  latter,  unable  to  understand  the  abstract  philosophical  tenets, <br/>worshiped  the  concrete  sculptured  idols  which  were  emblematic  of  these  secret  truths.  The  wisdom <br/>and  secreq?^  of  Egypt  are  epitomized  in  the  Sphinx,  which  has  preserved  its  secret  from  the  seekers  of <br/>a  hundred  generations.  The  mysteries  of  Hermeticism,  the  great  spiritual  truths  hidden  from  the <br/>world  by  the  ignorance  of  the  world,  and  the  keys  of  the  secret  doctrines  of  the  ancient  philosophers. <br/><br/><br/>are  all  symbolized  by  the  Virgin  Isis.  Veiled  from  head  to  foot,  she  reveals  her  wisdom  only  to  the <br/>tried  and  initiated  few  who  have  earned  the  right  to  enter  her  sacred  presence,  tear  from  the  veiled <br/>figure  of  Nature  its  shroud  of  obscurity,  and  stand  face  to  face  with  the  Divine  Reality. <br/><br/>The  explanations  in  these  pages  of  the  symbols  peculiar  to  the  Virgin  Isis  are  based  (unless  otherwise <br/>noted)  on  selections  from  a  free  translation  of  the  fourth  book  of  Biblioteque  des  Philosophes <br/>Hermetiques,  entitled  &quot;The  Hermetical  Signification  of  the  Symbols  and  Attributes  of  Isis,&quot;  with <br/>interpolations  by  the  compiler  to  amplify  and  clarify  the  text. <br/><br/>The  statues  of  Isis  were  decorated  with  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars,  and  many  emblems  pertaining  to <br/>the  earth,  over  which  Isis  was  believed  to  rule  (as  the  guardian  spirit  of  Nature  personified).  Several <br/>images  of  the  goddess  have  been  found  upon  which  the  marks  of  her  dignity  and  position  were  still <br/>intact.  According  to  the  ancient  philosophers,  she  personified  Universal  Nature,  the  mother  of  all <br/>productions.  The  deity  was  generally  represented  as  a  partly  nude  woman,  often  pregnant,  sometimes <br/>loosely  covered  with  a  garment  either  of  green  or  black  color,  or  of  four  different  shades  intermingled- <br/>black,  white,  yellow,  and  red. <br/><br/>Apuleius  describes  her  as  follows:  &quot;In  the  first  place,  then,  her  most  copious  and  long  hairs,  being <br/>gradually  intorted,  and  promiscuously  scattered  on  her  divine  neck,  were  softly  defluous.  A  multiform <br/>crown,  consisting  of  various  flowers,  bound  the  sublime  summit  of  her  head.  And  in  the  middle  of  the <br/>crown,  just  on  her  forehead,  there  was  a  smooth  orb  resembling  a  mirror,  or  rather  a  white  refulgent <br/>light,  which  indicated  that  she  was  the  moon.  Vipers  rising  up  after  the  manner  of  furrows,  environed <br/>the  crown  on  the  right  hand  and  on  the  left,  and  Cerealian  ears  of  corn  were  also  extended  from  above. <br/>Her  garment  was  of  many  colours,  and  woven  from  the  finest  flax,  and  was  at  one  time  lucid  with  a <br/>white  splendour,  at  another  yellow  from  the  flower  of  crocus,  and  at  another  flaming  with  a  rosy <br/>redness.  But  that  which  most  excessively  dazzled  my  sight,  was  a  very  black  robe,  fulgid  with  a  dark <br/>splendour,  and  which,  spreading  round  and  passing  under  her  right  side,  and  ascending  to  her  left <br/>shoulder,  there  rose  protuberant  like  the  center  of  a  shield,  the  dependent  part  of  the  robe  falling  in <br/>many  folds,  and  having  small  knots  of  fringe,  gracefully  flowing  in  its  extremities.  Glittering  stars <br/>were  dispersed  through  the  embroidered  border  of  the  robe,  and  through  the  whole  of  its  surface:  and <br/>the  full  moon,  shining  in  the  middle  of  the  stars,  breathed  forth  flaming  fires.  Nevertheless,  a  crown, <br/>wholly  consisting  of  flowers  and  fruits  of  every  kind,  adhered  with  indivisible  connexion  to  the  border <br/>of  that  conspicuous  robe,  in  all  its  undulating  motions.  What  she  carried  in  her  hands  also  consisted <br/>of  things  of  a  very  different  nature.  For  her  right  hand,  indeed,  bore  a  brazen  rattle  [sistrum]  through <br/>the  narrow  lamina  of  which  bent  like  a  belt,  certain  rods  passing,  produced  a  sharp  triple  sound, <br/>through  the  vibrating  motion  of  her  arm.  An  oblong  vessel,  in  the  shape  of  a  boat,  depended  from  her <br/>left  hand,  on  the  handle  of  which,  in  that  part  in  which  it  was  conspicuous,  an  asp  raised  its  erect  head <br/>and  largely  swelling  neck.  And  shoes  woven  from  the  leaves  of  the  victorious  palm  tree  covered  her <br/>immortal  feet.&quot; <br/><br/>The  green  color  alludes  to  the  vegetation  which  covers  the  face  of  the  earth,  and  therefore  represents <br/>the  robe  of  Nature.  The  black  represents  death  and  corruption  as  being  the  way  to  a  new  life  and <br/>generation.  &quot;Except  a  man  be  born  again,  he  cannot  see  the  kingdom  of  God.&quot;  (John  iii.  3.)  White, <br/>yellow,  and  red  signify  the  three  principal  colors  of  the  alchemical,  Hermetical,  universal  medicine <br/>after  the  blackness  of  its  putrefaction  is  over. <br/><br/>The  ancients  gave  the  name  Isis  to  one  of  their  occult  medicines;  therefore  the  description  here  given <br/>relates  somewhat  to  chemistry.  Her  black  drape  also  signifies  that  the  moon,  or  the  lunar  humidity&#x2014; <br/>the  sophic  universal  mercury  and  the  operating  substance  of  Nature  in  alchemical  terminology&#x2014;has <br/>no  light  of  its  own,  but  receives  its  light,  its  fire,  and  its  vitalizing  force  from  the  sun.  Isis  was <br/><br/><br/>THE  SISTRUM. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;The  sistrum  is  designed  *  *  *  to  represent  to  us,  that  every  thing  must  be  kept  in  continual  agitation,  and  never  cease <br/>from  motion;  that  they  ought  to  be  mused  and  well-shaken,  whenever  they  begin  to  grow  drowsy  as  it  were,  and  to  droop <br/>in  their  motion.  For,  say  they,  the  sound  of  these  sistra  averts  and  drives  away  Typho;  meaning  hereby,  that  as  corruption <br/>clogs  and  puts  a  stop  to  the  regular  course  of  nature;  so  generation,  by  the  means  of  motion,  loosens  it  again,  and  restores <br/>it  to  its  former  vigour.  Now  the  outer  surface  of  this  instrument  is  of  a  convex  figure,  as  within  its  circumference  are <br/>contained  those  four  chords  or  bars  [only  three  shown],  which  make  such  a  rattling  when  they  are  shaken&#x2014; nor  is  this <br/>without  its  meaning;  for  that  part  of  the  universe  which  is  subject  to  generation  and  corruption  is  contained  within  the <br/>sphere  of  the  moon;  and  whatever  motions  or  changes  may  happen  therein,  they  are  all  effected  by  the  different <br/>combinations  of  the  four  elementary  bodies,  fire,  earth,  water,  and  air &#x2014;moreover,  upon  the  upper  part  of  the  convex <br/>surface  of  the  sistrum  is  carved  the  effigies  of  a  cat  with  a  human  visage,  as  on  the  lower  edge  of  it,  under  those  moving <br/>chords,  is  engraved  on  the  one  side  the  face  of  Isis,  and  on  the  other  that  of  Nephthys~by  the  faces  symbolically <br/>representing  generation  and  corruption  (which,  as  has  been  already  observed,  is  nothing  but  the  motion  and  alteration  of <br/>the  four  elements  one  amongst  another),&quot; <br/><br/>(From  Plutarch's  Isis  and  Osiris.) <br/><br/>p-47 <br/><br/>the  image  or  representative  of  the  Great  Works  of  the  wise  men:  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  the  Elixir  of <br/>Life,  and  the  Universal  Medicine. <br/><br/>Other  hieroglyphics  seen  in  connection  with  Isis  are  no  less  curious  than  those  already  described,  but <br/>it  is  impossible  to  enumerate  all,  for  many  symbols  were  used  interchangeably  by  the  Egyptian <br/>Hermetists.  The  goddess  often  wore  upon  her  head  a  hat  made  of  cypress  branches,  to  signify <br/>mourning  for  her  dead  husband  and  also  for  the  physical  death  which  she  caused  every  creature  to <br/>undergo  in  order  to  receive  a  new  life  in  posterity  or  a  periodic  resurrection.  The  head  of  Isis  is <br/>sometimes  ornamented  with  a  crown  of  gold  or  a  garland  of  olive  leaves,  as  conspicuous  marks  of  her <br/>sovereignty  as  queen  of  the  world  and  mistress  of  the  entire  universe.  The  crown  of  gold  signifies  also <br/>the  aurific  unctuosity  or  sulphurous  fatness  of  the  solar  and  vital  fires  which  she  dispenses  to  every <br/>individual  by  a  continual  circulation  of  the  elements,  this  circulation  being  symbolized  by  the  musical <br/>rattle  which  she  carries  in  her  hand.  This  sistrum  is  also  the  yonic  symbol  of  purity. <br/><br/>A  serpent  interwoven  among  the  olive  leaves  on  her  head,  devouring  its  own  tail,  denotes  that  the <br/>aurific  unctuosity  was  soiled  with  the  venom  of  terrestrial  corruption  which  surrounded  it  and  must <br/>be  mortified  and  purified  by  seven  planetary  circulations  or  purifications  called/Zi/mg^  eagles <br/>(alchemical  terminology)  in  order  to  make  it  medicinal  for  the  restoration  of  health.  (Here  the <br/>emanations  from  the  sun  are  recognized  as  a  medicine  for  the  healing  of  human  ills.)  The  seven <br/><br/><br/>planetary  circulations  are  represented  by  the  circumambulations  of  the  Masonic  lodge;  by  the <br/><br/>marching  of  the  Jewish  priests  seven  times  around  the  walls  of  Jericho,  and  of  the  Mohammedan <br/>priests  seven  times  around  the  Kabba  at  Mecca.  From  the  crown  of  gold  project  three  horns  of  plenty, <br/>signifying  the  abundance  of  the  gifts  of  Nature  proceeding  from  one  root  having  its  origin  in  the <br/>heavens  (head  of  Isis). <br/><br/>In  this  figure  the  pagan  naturalists  represent  all  the  vital  powers  of  the  three  kingdoms  and  families <br/>of  sublunary  nature-mineral,  plant,  and  animal  (man  considered  as  an  animal).  At  one  of  her  ears  was <br/>the  moon  and  at  the  other  the  sun,  to  indicate  that  these  two  were  the  agent  and  patient,  or  father  and <br/>mother  principles  of  all  natural  objects;  and  that  Isis,  or  Nature,  makes  use  of  these  two  luminaries  to <br/>communicate  her  powers  to  the  whole  empire  of  animals,  vegetables,  and  minerals.  On  the  back  of <br/>her  neck  were  the  characters  of  the  planets  and  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  which  assisted  the  planets  in <br/>their  functions.  This  signified  that  the  heavenly  influences  directed  the  destinies  of  the  principles  and <br/>sperms  of  all  things,  because  they  were  the  governors  of  all  sublunary  bodies,  which  they  transformed <br/>into  little  worlds  made  in  the  image  of  the  greater  universe. <br/><br/>Isis  holds  in  her  right  hand  a  small  sailing  ship  with  the  spindle  of  a  spinning  wheel  for  its  mast.  From <br/>the  top  of  the  mast  projects  a  water  jug,  its  handle  shaped  like  a  serpent  swelled  with  venom.  This <br/>indicates  that  Isis  steers  the  bark  of  life,  full  of  troubles  and  miseries,  on  the  stormy  ocean  of  Time. <br/>The  spindle  symbolizes  the  fact  that  she  spins  and  cuts  the  thread  of  Life.  These  emblems  further <br/>signify  that  Isis  abounds  in  humidity,  by  means  of  which  she  nourishes  all  natural  bodies,  preserving <br/>them  from  the  heat  of  the  sun  by  humidifying  them  with  nutritious  moisture  from  the  atmosphere. <br/>Moisture  supports  vegetation,  but  this  subtle  humidity  (life  ether)  is  always  more  or  less  infected  by <br/>some  venom  proceeding  from  corruption  or  decay.  It  must  be  purified  by  being  brought  into  contact <br/>with  the  invisible  cleansing  fire  of  Nature.  This  fire  digests,  perfects,  and  revitalizes  this  substance,  in <br/>order  that  the  humidity  may  become  a  universal  medicine  to  heal  and  renew  all  the  bodies  in  Nature. <br/><br/>The  serpent  throws  off  its  skin  annually  and  is  thereby  renewed  (symbolic  of  the  resurrection  of  the <br/>spiritual  life  from  the  material  nature).  This  renewal  of  the  earth  takes  place  every  spring,  when  the <br/>vivifying  spirit  of  the  sun  returns  to  the  countries  of  the  Northern  Hemisphere, <br/><br/>The  symbolic  Virgin  carries  in  her  left  hand  a  sistrum  and  a  cymbal,  or  square  frame  of  metal,  which <br/>when  struck  gives  the  key-note  of  Nature  (Fa);  sometimes  also  an  olive  branch,  to  indicate  the <br/>harmony  she  preserves  among  natural  things  with  her  regenerating  power.  By  the  processes  of  death <br/>and  corruption  she  gives  life  to  a  number  of  creatures  of  diverse  forms  through  periods  of  perpetual <br/>change.  The  cymbal  is  made  square  instead  of  the  usual  triangular  shape  in  order  to  symbolize  that  all <br/>things  are  transmuted  and  regenerated  according  to  the  harmony  of  the  four  elements. <br/><br/>Dr.  Sigismund  Bacstrom  believed  that  if  a  physician  could  establish  harmony  among  the  elements  of <br/>earth,  fire,  air,  and  water,  and  unite  them  into  a  stone  (the  Philosopher's  Stone)  symbolized  by  the <br/>six-pointed  star  or  two  interlaced  triangles,  he  would  possess  the  means  of  healing  all  disease.  Dr. <br/>Bacstrom  further  stated  that  there  was  no  doubt  in  his  mind  that  the  universal,  omnipresent  fire <br/>(spirit)  of  Nature:  &quot;does  all  and  is  all  in  all.&quot;  By  attraction,  repulsion,  motion,  heat,  sublimation, <br/>evaporation,  exsiccation,  inspissation,  coagulation,  and  fixation,  the  Universal  Fire  (Spirit) <br/>manipulates  matter,  and  manifests  throughout  creation.  Any  individual  who  can  understand  these <br/>principles  and  adapt  them  to  the  three  departments  of  Nature  becomes  a  true  philosopher. <br/><br/>From  the  right  breast  of  Isis  protruded  a  bunch  of  grapes  and  from,  the  left  an  ear  of  corn  or  a  sheaf <br/>of  wheat,  golden  in  color.  These  indicate  that  Nature  is  the  source  of  nutrition  for  plant,  animal,  and <br/>human  life,  nourishing  all  things  from  herself.  The  golden  color  in  the  wheat  (corn)  indicates  that  in <br/>the  sunlight  or  spiritual  gold  is  concealed  the  first  sperm  of  all  life. <br/><br/><br/>On  the  girdle  surrounding  the  upper  part  of  the  body  of  the  statue  appear  a  number  of  mysterious <br/>emblems.  The  girdle  is  joined  together  in  front  by  four  golden  plates  (the  elements),  placed  in  the <br/>form  of  a  square.  This  signified  that  Isis,  or  Nature,  the  first  matter  (alchemical  terminology),  was  the <br/>essence-  of  the  four  elements  (life,  light,  heat,  and  force),  which  quintessence  generated  all  things. <br/>Numerous  stars  are  represented  on  this  girdle,  thereby  indicating  their  influence  in  darkness  as  well <br/>as  the  influence  of  the  sun  in  light.  Isis  is  the  Virgin  immortalized  in  the  constellation  of  Virgo,  where <br/>the  World  Mother  is  placed  with  the  serpent  under  her  feet  and  a  crown,  of  stars  on  her  head.  In  her <br/>arms  she  carries  a  sheaf  of  grain  and  sometimes  the  young  Sun  God. <br/><br/>The  statue  of  Isis  was  placed  on  a  pedestal  of  dark  stone  ornamented  with  rams'  heads.  Her  feet  trod <br/>upon  a  number  of  venomous  reptiles.  This  indicates  that  Nature  has  power  to  free  from  acidity  or <br/>saltness  all  corrosives  and  to  overcome  all  impurities  from  terrestrial  corruption  adhering  to  bodies. <br/>The  rams'  heads  indicate  that  the  most  auspicious  time  for  the  generation  of  life  is  during  the  period <br/>when  the  sun  passes  through  the  sign  of  Aries.  The  serpents  under  her  feet  indicate  that  Nature  is <br/>inclined  to  preserve  life  and  to  heal  disease  by  expelling  impurities  and  corruption. <br/><br/>In  this  sense  the  axioms  known  to  the  ancient  philosophers  are  verified;  namely: <br/><br/>Nature  contains  Nature, <br/><br/>Nature  rejoices  in  her  own  nature, <br/><br/>Nature  surmounts  Nature; <br/><br/>Nature  cannot  be  amended  but  in  her  own  nature. <br/><br/>Therefore,  in  contemplating  the  statue  of  Isis,  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  occult  sense  of  its <br/>allegories;  otherwise,  the  Virgin  remains  an  inexplicable  enigma. <br/><br/>From  a  golden  ring  on  her  left  arm  a  line  descends,  to  the  end  of  which  is  suspended  a  deep  box  filled <br/>with  flaming  coals  and  incense.  Isis,  or  Nature  personified,  carries  with  her  the  sacred  fire,  religiously <br/>preserved  and  kept  burning  in.  a  special  temple  by  the  vestal  virgins.  This  fire  is  the  genuine, <br/>immortal  flame  of  Nature&#x2014;ethereal,  essential,  the  author  of  life.  The  inconsumable  oil;  the  balsam  of <br/>life,  so  much  praised  by  the  wise  and  so  often  referred  to  in  the  Scriptures,  is  frequently  symbolized  as <br/>the  fuel  of  this  immortal  flame. <br/><br/>From  the  right  arm  of  the  figure  also  descends  a  thread,  to  the  end  of  which  is  fastened  a  pair  of  scales, <br/>to  denote  the  exactitude  of  Nature  in  her  weights  and  measures.  Isis  is  often  represented  as  the <br/>symbol  of  justice,  because  Nature  is  eternally  consistent. <br/><br/><br/>THOTH,  THE  DOG-HEADED. <br/><br/><br/>From  Lenoir's  La  Franche-Maconnerie. <br/><br/><br/>Aroueris,  or  Thoth,  one  of  the  five  immortals,  protected  the  infant  Horus  from  the  wrath  of  Typhon  after  the  murder  of <br/>Osiris.  He  also  revised  the  ancient  Egyptian  calendar  by  increasing  the  year  from  360  days  to  365.  Thoth  Hermes  was <br/>called  &quot;The  Dog-Headed&quot;  because  of  his  faithfulness  and  integrity.  He  is  shown  crowned  with  a  solar  nimbus,  carrying  in <br/>one  hand  the  Crux  Ansata,  the  symbol  of  eternal  life,  and  in  the  other  a  serpent- wound  staff  symbolic  of  his  dignity  as <br/>counselor  of  the  gods. <br/><br/><br/>Isis  is  shown  with  her  son  Horus  in  her  arms.  She  is  crowned  with  the  lunar  orb,  ornamented  with  the  horns  of  rams  or <br/>bulls.  Orus,  or  Horus  as  he  is  more  generally  known,  was  the  son  of  Isis  and  Osiris.  He  was  the  god  of  time,  hours,  days, <br/>and  this  narrow  span  of  life  recognized  as  mortal  existence.  In  all  probability,  the  four  sons  of  Horus  represent  the  four <br/>kingdoms  of  Nature.  It  was  Horus  who  finally  avenged  the  murder  of  his  father,  Osiris,  by  slaying  Typhon,  the  spirit  of <br/>Evil. <br/><br/><br/>THE  EGYPTIAN  MADONNA. <br/><br/><br/>From  Lenoir's  La  Franche-Maconnerie. <br/><br/><br/>p.  48 <br/><br/><br/>The  World  Virgin  is  sometimes  shown  standing  between  two  great  pillars&#x2014;the  Jachin  and  Boaz  of <br/><br/>Freemasonry~symbolizing  the  fact  that  Nature  attains  productivity  by  means  of  polarity.  As  wisdom <br/>personified,  Isis  stands  between  the  pillars  of  opposites,  demonstrating  that  understanding  is  always <br/>found  at  the  point  of  equilibrium  and  that  truth  is  often  crucified  between  the  two  thieves  of  apparent <br/>contradiction. <br/><br/>The  sheen  of  gold  in  her  dark  hair  indicates  that  while  she  is  lunar,  her  power  is  due  to  the  sun's  rays, <br/>from  which  she  secures  her  ruddy  complexion.  As  the  moon  is  robed  in  the  reflected  light  of  the  sun, <br/>so  Isis,  like  the  virgin  of  Revelation,  is  clothed  in  the  glory  of  solar  luminosity.  Apuleius  states  that <br/>while  he  was  sleeping  he  beheld  the  venerable  goddess  Isis  rising  out  of  the  ocean.  The  ancients <br/>realized  that  the  primary  forms  of  life  first  came  out  of  water,  and  modem  science  concurs  in  this  view. <br/>H.  G.  Wells,  in  his  Outline  of  History,  describing  primitive  life  on  the  earth,  states:  &quot;But  though  the <br/>ocean  and  intertidal  water  already  swarmed  with  life,  the  land  above  the  high-tide  line  was  still,  so  far <br/>as  we  can  guess,  a  stony  wilderness  without  a  trace  of  life.&quot;  In  the  next  chapter  he  adds:  &quot;Wherever <br/>the  shore-line  ran  there  was  life,  and  that  life  went  on  in  and  by  and  with  water  as  its  home,  its <br/>medium,  and  its  fundamental  necessity.&quot;  The  ancients  believed  that  the  universal  sperm  proceeded <br/>from  warm  vapor,  humid  but  fiery.  The  veiled  Isis,  whose  very  coverings  represent  vapor,  is  symbolic <br/>of  this  humidity,  which  is  the  carrier  or  vehicle  for  the  sperm  life  of  the  sun,  represented  by  a  child  in <br/>her  arms.  Because  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars  in  setting  appear  to  sink  into  the  sea  and  also  because  the <br/>water  receives  their  rays  into  itself,  the  sea  was  believed  to  be  the  breeding  ground  for  the  sperm  of <br/>living  things.  This  sperm  is  generated  from  the  combination  of  the  influences  of  the  celestial  bodies; <br/>hence  Isis  is  sometimes  represented  as  pregnant. <br/><br/>Frequently  the  statue  of  Isis  was  accompanied  by  the  figure  of  a  large  black  and  white  ox.  The  ox <br/>represents  either  Osiris  as  Taurus,  the  bull  of  the  zodiac,  or  Apis,  an  animal  sacred  to  Osiris  because <br/>of  its  peculiar  markings  and  colorings.  Among  the  Egyptians,  the  bull  was  a  beast  of  burden.  Hence <br/>the  presence  of  the  animal  was  a  reminder  of  the  labors  patiently  performed  by  Nature  that  all <br/>creatures  may  have  life  and  health.  Harpocrates,  the  God  of  Silence,  holding  his  lingers  to  his  mouth, <br/>often  accompanies  the  statue  of  Isis.  He  warns  all  to  keep  the  secrets  of  the  wise  from  those  unfit  to <br/>know  them. <br/><br/>The  Druids  of  Britain  and  Gaul  had  a  deep  knowledge  concerning  the  mysteries  of  Isis  and  worshiped <br/>her  under  the  symbol  of  the  moon.  Godfrey  Higgins  considers  it  a  mistake  to  regard  Isis  as <br/>synonymous  with  the  moon.  The  moon  was  chosen  for  Isis  because  of  its  dominion  over  water.  The <br/>Druids  considered  the  sun  to  be  the  father  and  the  moon  the  mother  of  all  things.  By  means  of  these <br/>symbols  they  worshiped  Universal  Nature. <br/><br/>The  figure  of  Isis  is  sometimes  used  to  represent  the  occult  and  magical  arts,  such  as  necromancy, <br/>invocation,  sorcery,  and  thaumaturgy.  In  one  of  the  myths  concerning  her,  Isis  is  said  to  have <br/>conjured  the  invincible  God  of  Eternities,  Ra,  to  tell  her  his  secret  and  sacred  name,  which  he  did. <br/>This  name  is  equivalent  to  the  Lost  Word  of  Masonry.  By  means  of  this  Word,  a  magician  can  demand <br/>obedience  from  the  invisible  and  superior  deities.  The  priests  of  Isis  became  adepts  in  the  use  of  the <br/>unseen  forces  of  Nature.  They  understood  hypnotism,  mesmerism,  and  similar  practices  long  before <br/>the  modem  world  dreamed  of  their  existence. <br/><br/>Plutarch  describes  the  requisites  of  a  follower  of  Isis  in  this  manner:  &quot;For  as  'tis  not  the  length  of  the <br/>beard,  or  the  coarseness  of  the  habit  which  makes  a  philosopher,  so  neither  will  those  frequent <br/>shavings,  or  the  mere  wearing  [of]  a  linen  vestment  constitute  a  votary  of  Isis;  but  he  alone  is  a  true <br/>servant  or  follower  of  this  Goddess,  who  after  he  has  heard,  and  been  made  acquainted  in  a  proper <br/>manner  with  the  history  of  the  actions  of  these  Gods,  searches  into  the  hidden  truths  which  he <br/>concealed  under  them,  and  examines  the  whole  by  the  dictates  of  reason  and  philosophy.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages  the  troubadours  of  Central  Europe  preserved  in  song  the  legends  of  this <br/><br/>Egyptian  goddess.  They  composed  sonnets  to  the  most  beautiful  woman  in  all  the  world.  Though  few <br/>ever  discovered  her  identity,  she  was  Sophia,  the  Virgin  of  Wisdom,  whom  all  the  philosophers  of  the <br/>world  have  wooed.  Isis  represents  the  mystery  of  motherhood,  which  the  ancients  recognized  as  the <br/>most  apparent  proof  of  Nature's  omniscient  wisdom  and  God's  overshadowing  power.  To  the  modem <br/>seeker  she  is  the  epitome  of  the  Great  Unknown,  and  only  those  who  unveil  her  will  be  able  to  solve <br/>the  mysteries  of  life,  death,  generation,  and  regeneration. <br/><br/>MUMMIFICATION  OF  THE  EGYPTIAN  DEAD <br/><br/>Servius,  commenting  on  Virgil's  ^nezd,  observes  that  &quot;the  wise  Egyptians  took  care  to  embalm  their <br/>bodies,  and  deposit  them  in  catacombs,  in  order  that  the  soul  might  be  preserved  for  a  long  time  in <br/>connection  with  the  body,  and  might  not  soon  be  alienated;  while  the  Romans,  with  an  opposite <br/>design,  committed  the  remains  of  their  dead  to  the  funeral  pile,  intending  that  the  vital  spark  might <br/>immediately  be  restored  to  the  general  element,  or  return  to  its  pristine  nature.&quot;  (From  Prichard's  An <br/>Analysis  of  the  Egyptian  Mythology.) <br/><br/>No  complete  records  are  available  which  give  the  secret  doctrine  of  the  Egyptians  concerning  the <br/>relationship  existing  between  the  spirit,  or  consciousness,  and  the  body  which  it  inhabited.  It  is <br/>reasonably  certain,  however,  that  Pythagoras,  who  had  been  initiated  in  the  Egyptian  temples,  when <br/>he  promulgated  the  doctrine  of  metempsychosis,  restated,  in  part  at  least,  the  teachings  of  the <br/>Egyptian  initiates.  The  popular  supposition  that  the  Egyptians  mummified  their  dead  in  order  to <br/>preserve  the  form  for  a  physical  resurrection  is  untenable  in  the  light  of  modern  knowledge  regarding <br/>their  philosophy  of  death.  In  the  fourth  book  of  On  Abstinence  from  Animal  Food,  Porphyry <br/>describes  an  Egyptian  custom  of  purifying  the  dead  by  removing  the  contents  of  the  abdominal  cavity, <br/>which  they  placed  in  a  separate  chest.  He  then  reproduces  the  following  oration  which  had  been <br/>translated  out  of  the  Egyptian  tongue  by  Euphantus:  &quot;O  sovereign  Sun,  and  all  ye  Gods  who  impart <br/>life  to  men,  receive  me,  and  deliver  me  to  the  eternal  Gods  as  a  cohabitant.  For  I  have  always  piously <br/>worshipped  those  divinities  which  were  pointed  out  to  me  by  my  parents  as  long  as  I  lived  in  this  age, <br/>and  have  likewise  always  honored  those  who  procreated  my  body.  And,  with  respect  to  other  men,  I <br/>have  never  slain  any  one,  nor  defrauded  any  one  of  what  he  deposited  with  me,  nor  have  I  committed <br/>any  other  atrocious  deed.  If,  therefore,  during  my  life  I  have  acted  erroneously,  by  eating  or  drinking <br/>things  which  it  is  unlawful  to  cat  or  drink,  I  have  not  erred  through  myself,  but  through  these&quot; <br/>(pointing  to  the  chest  which  contained  the  viscera).  The  removal  of  the  organs  identified  as  the  seat  of <br/>the  appetites  was  considered  equivalent  to  the  purification  of  the  body  from  their  evil  influences. <br/><br/>So  literally  did  the  early  Christians  interpret  their  Scriptures  that  they  preserved  the  bodies  of  their <br/>dead  by  pickling  them  in  salt  water,  so  that  on  the  day  of  resurrection  the  spirit  of  the  dead  might <br/>reenter  a  complete  and  perfectly  preserved  body.  Believing  that  the  incisions  necessary  to  the <br/>embalming  process  and  the  removal  of  the  internal  organs  would  prevent  the  return  of  the  spirit  to  its <br/>body,  the  Christians  buried  their  dead  without  resorting  to  the  more  elaborate  mummification <br/>methods  employed  by  the  Egyptian  morticians. <br/><br/>In  his  work  on  Egyptian  Magic,  S.S.D.D.  hazards  the  following  speculation  concerning  the  esoteric <br/>purposes  behind  the  practice  of  mummification.  &quot;There  is  every  reason  to  suppose,&quot;  he  says,  &quot;that <br/>only  those  who  had  received  some  grade  of  initiation  were  mummified;  for  it  is  certain  that,  in  the <br/>eyes  of  the  Egyptians,  mummification  effectually  prevented  reincarnation.  Reincarnation  was <br/>necessary  to  imperfect  souls,  to  those  who  had  failed  to  pass  the  tests  of  initiation;  but  for  those  who <br/>had  the  Will  and  the  capacity  to  enter  the  Secret  Adytum,  there  was  seldom  necessity  for  that <br/>liberation  of  the  soul  which  is  said  to  be  effected  by  the  destruction  of  the  body.  The  body  of  the <br/>Initiate  was  therefore  preserved  after  death  as  a  species  of  Talisman  or  material  basis  for  the <br/>manifestation  of  the  Soul  upon  earth.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>During  the  period  of  its  inception  mummification  was  limited  to  the  Pharaoh  and  such  other  persons <br/>of  royal  rank  as  presumably  partook  of  the  attributes  of  the  great  Osiris,  the  divine,  mummified  King <br/>of  the  Egyptian  Underworld. <br/><br/><br/>OSIRIS,  KING  OF  THE  UNDERWORLD. <br/><br/><br/>Osiris  is  often  represented  with  the  lower  par,  of  his  body  enclosed  in  a  mummy  case  or  wrapped  about  with  funeral <br/>bandages.  Man's  spirit  consists  of  three  distinct  parts,  only  one  of  which  incarnates  in  physical  form.  The  human  body  was <br/>considered  to  be  a  tomb  or  sepulcher  of  this  incarnating  spirit.  Therefore  Osiris,  a  symbol  of  the  incarnating  ego,  was <br/>represented  with  the  lower  half  of  his  body  mummified  to  indicate  that  he  was  the  living  spirit  of  man  enclosed  within  the <br/>material  form  symbolized  by  the  mummy  case. <br/><br/>There  is  a  romance  between  the  active  principle  of  God  and  the  passive  principle  of  Nature.  From  the  union  of  these  two <br/>principles  is  produced  the  rational  creation.  Man  is  a  composite  creature.  From  his  Father  (the  active  principle)  he <br/>inherits  his  Divine  Spirit,  the  fire  of  aspiration&#x2014;that  immortal  part  of  himself  which  rises  triumphant  from  the  broken  clay <br/>of  mortality:  that  part  which  remains  after  the  natural  organisms  have  disintegrated  or  have  been  regenerated.  From  his <br/>Mother  (the  passive  principle)  he  inherits  his  body&#x2014;that  part  over  which  the  laws  of  Nature  have  control:  his  humanity, <br/>his  mortal  personality,  his  appetites,  his  feelings,  and  his  emotions.  The  Egyptians  also  believed  that  Osiris  was  the  river <br/>Nile  and  that  Isis  (his  sister-wife)  was  the  contiguous  land,  which,  when  inundated  by  the  river,  bore  fruit  and  harvest. <br/>The  murky  water  of  the  Nile  were  believed  to  account  for  the  blackness  of  Osiris,  who  was  generally  symbolized  as  being  of <br/>ebony  hue. <br/><br/><br/>p-49 <br/><br/><br/>The  Sun,  A  Universal  Deity <br/><br/>THE  adoration  of  the  sun  was  one  of  the  earhest  and  most  natural  forms  of  rehgious  expression. <br/>Complex  modern  theologies  are  merely  involvements  and  amplifications  of  this  simple  aboriginal <br/>belief.  The  primitive  mind,  recognizing  the  beneficent  power  of  the  solar  orb,  adored  it  as  the  proxy  of <br/>the  Supreme  Deity.  Concerning  the  origin  of  sun  worship,  Albert  Pike  makes  the  following  concise <br/>statement  in  his  Morals  and  Dogma:  &quot;To  them  [aboriginal  peoples]  he  [the  sun]  was  the  innate  fire  of <br/>bodies,  the  fire  of  Nature.  Author  of  Life,  heat,  and  ignition,  he  was  to  them  the  efficient  cause  of  all <br/>generation,  for  without  him  there  was  no  movement,  no  existence,  no  form.  He  was  to  them  immense, <br/>indivisible,  imperishable,  and  everywhere  present.  It  was  their  need  of  light,  and  of  his  creative <br/>energy,  that  was  felt  by  all  men;  and  nothing  was  more  fearful  to  them  than  his  absence.  His <br/>beneficent  influences  caused  his  identification  with  the  Principle  of  Good;  and  the  BRAHMA  of  the <br/>Hindus,  and  MITHRAS  of  the  Persians,  and  ATHOM,  AMUN,  PHTHA,  and  OSIRIS,  of  the  Egyptians, <br/>the  BEL  of  the  Chaldeans,  the  ADONAI  of  the  Phoenicians,  the  ADONIS  and  APOLLO  of  the  Greeks, <br/>became  but  personifications  of  the  Sun,  the  regenerating  Principle,  image  of  that  fecundity  which <br/>perpetuates  and  rejuvenates  the  world's  existence.&quot; <br/><br/>Among  all  the  nations  of  antiquity,  altars,  mounds,  and  temples  were  dedicated  to  the  worship  of  the <br/>orb  of  day.  The  ruins  of  these  sacred  places  yet  remain,  notable  among  them  being  the  pyramids  of <br/>Yucatan  and  Egypt,  the  snake  mounds  of  the  American  Indians,  the  Zikkurats  of  Babylon  and  Chaldea, <br/>the  round  towers  of  Ireland,  and  the  massive  rings  of  uncut  stone  in  Britain  and  Normandy.  The <br/>Tower  of  Babel,  which,  according  to  the  Scriptures,  was  built  so  that  man  might  reach  up  to  God,  was <br/>probably  an  astronomical  observatory. <br/><br/>Many  early  priests  and  prophets,  both  pagan  and  Christian,  were  versed  in  astronomy  and  astrology; <br/>their  writings  are  best  understood  when  read  in  the  light  of  these  ancient  sciences.  With  the  growth  of <br/>man's  knowledge  of  the  constitution  and  periodicity  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  astronomical  principles <br/>and  terminology  were  introduced  into  his  religious  systems.  The  tutelary  gods  were  given  planetary <br/>thrones,  the  celestial  bodies  being  named  after  the  deities  assigned  to  them.  The  fixed  stars  were <br/>divided  into  constellations,  and  through  these  constellations  wandered  the  sun  and  its  planets,  the <br/>latter  with  their  accompanying  satellites. <br/><br/>THE  SOLAR  TRINITY <br/><br/>The  sun,  as  supreme  among  the  celestial  bodies  visible  to  the  astronomers  of  antiquity,  was  assigned <br/>to  the  highest  of  the  gods  and  became  symbolic  of  the  supreme  authority  of  the  Creator  Himself. <br/>From  a  deep  philosophic  consideration  of  the  powers  and  principles  of  the  sun  has  come  the  concept <br/>of  the  Trinity  as  it  is  understood  in  the  world  today.  The  tenet  of  a  Triune  Divinity  is  not  peculiar  to <br/>Christian  or  Mosaic  theology,  but  forms  a  conspicuous  part  of  the  dogma  of  the  greatest  religions  of <br/>both  ancient  and  modern  times.  The  Persians,  Hindus,  Babylonians,  and  Egyptians  had  their  Trinities. <br/>In  every  instance  these  represented  the  threefold  form  of  one  Supreme  Intelligence.  In  modern <br/>Masonry,  the  Deity  is  symbolized  by  an  equilateral  triangle,  its  three  sides  representing  the  primary <br/>manifestations  of  the  Eternal  One  who  is  Himself  represented  as  a  tiny  flame,  called  by  the  Hebrews <br/>Yod  (').  Jakob  Bohme,  the  Teutonic  mystic,  calls  the  Trinity  The  Three  Witnesses,  by  means  of  which <br/>the  Invisible  is  made  known  to  the  visible,  tangible  universe. <br/><br/>The  origin  of  the  Trinity  is  obvious  to  anyone  who  will  observe  the  daily  manifestations  of  the  sun. <br/>This  orb,  being  the  symbol  of  all  Light,  has  three  distinct  phases:  rising,  midday,  and  setting.  The <br/>philosophers  therefore  divided  the  life  of  all  things  into  three  distinct  parts:  growth,  maturity,  and <br/>decay.  Between  the  twilight  of  dawn  and  the  twilight  of  evening  is  the  high  noon  of  resplendent  glory. <br/><br/><br/>God  the  Father,  the  Creator  of  the  world,  is  symboHzed  by  the  dawn.  His  color  is  blue,  because  the  sun <br/>rising  in  the  morning  is  veiled  in  blue  mist.  God  the  Son  he  Illuminating  One  sent  to  bear  witness  of <br/>His  Father  before  all  the  worlds,  is  the  celestial  globe  at  noonday,  radiant  and  magnificent,  the  maned <br/>Lion  of  Judah,  the  Golden-haired  Savior  of  the  World.  Yellow  is  His  color  and  His  power  is  without <br/>end.  God  the  Holy  Ghost  is  the  sunset  phase,  when  the  orb  of  day,  robed  in  flaming  red,  rests  for  a <br/>moment  upon  the  horizon  line  and  then  vanishes  into  the  darkness  of  the  night  to  wandering  the <br/>lower  worlds  and  later  rise  again  triumphant  from  the  embrace  of  darkness. <br/><br/>To  the  Egyptians  the  sun  was  the  symbol  of  immortality,  for,  while  it  died  each  night,  it  rose  again <br/>with  each  ensuing  dawn.  Not  only  has  the  sun  this  diurnal  activity,  but  it  also  has  its  annual <br/>pilgrimage,  during  which  time  it  passes  successively  through  the  twelve  celestial  houses  of  the <br/>heavens,  remaining  in  each  for  thirty  days.  Added  to  these  it  has  a  third  path  of  travel,  which  is  called <br/>the  precession  of  the  equinoxes,  in  which  it  retrogrades  around  the  zodiac  through  the  twelve  signs  at <br/>the  rate  of  one  degree  every  seventy-two  years. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  annual  passage  of  the  sun  through  the  twelve  houses  of  the  heavens,  Robert  Hewitt <br/>Brown,  32&#x00b0;,  makes  the  following  statement:  &quot;The  Sun,  as  he  pursued  his  way  among  these  'living <br/>creatures'  of  the  zodiac,  was  said,  in  allegorical  language,  either  to  assume  the  nature  of  or  to  triumph <br/>over  the  sign  he  entered.  The  sun  thus  became  a  Bull  in  Taurus,  and  was  worshipped  as  such  by  the <br/>Egyptians  under  the  name  of  Apis,  and  by  the  Assyrians  as  Bel,  Baal,  or  Bui.  In  Leo  the  sun  became  a <br/>Lion-slayer,  Hercules,  and  an  Archer  in  Sagittarius.  In  Pisces,  the  Fishes,  he  was  a  fish&#x2014;Dagon,  or <br/>Vishnu,  the  fish-god  of  the  Philistines  and  Hindoos.&quot; <br/><br/>A  careful  analysis  of  the  religious  systems  of  pagandom  uncovers  much  evidence  of  the  fact  that  its <br/>priests  served  the  solar  energy  and  that  their  Supreme  Deity  was  in  every  case  this  Divine  Light <br/>personified.  Godfrey  Higgins,  after  thirty  years  of  inquiry  into  the  origin  of  religious  beliefs,  is  of  the <br/>opinion  that  &quot;All  the  Gods  of  antiquity  resolved  themselves  into  the  solar  fire,  sometimes  itself  as  God, <br/>or  sometimes  an  emblem  or  shekinah  of  that  higher  principle,  known  by  the  name  of  the  creative <br/>Being  or  God.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  priests  in  many  of  their  ceremonies  wore  the  skins  of  lions,  which  were  symbols  of  the <br/>solar  orb,  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  sun  is  exalted,  dignified,  and  most  fortunately  placed  in  the <br/>constellation  of  Leo,  which  he  rules  and  which  was  at  one  time  the  keystone  of  the  celestial  arch. <br/>Again,  Hercules  is  the  Solar  Deity,  for  as  this  mighty  hunter  performed  his  twelve  labors,  so  the  sun, <br/>in  traversing  the  twelve  houses  of  the  zodiacal  band,  performs  during  his  pilgrimage  twelve  essential <br/>and  benevolent  labors  for  the  human  race  and  for  Nature  in  general,  Hercules,  like  the  Egyptian <br/>priests,  wore  the  skin  of  a  lion  for  a  girdle.  Samson,  the  Hebrew  hero,  as  his <br/><br/><br/>THE  LION  OF  THE  SUN. <br/><br/><br/>From  Maurice 's  Indian  Antiquities. <br/><br/>The  sun  rising  over  the  back  of  the  hon  or,  astrologically,  in  the  back  of  the  hon,  has  always  been  considered  symbohc  of <br/>power  and  rulership.  A  symbol  very  similar  to  the  one  above  appears  on  the  flag  of  Persia,  whose  people  have  always  been <br/>sun  worshipers.  Kings  and  emperors  have  frequently  associated  their  terrestrial  power  with  the  celestial  Power  of  the  solar <br/>orb,  and  have  accepted  the  sun,  or  one  of  its  symbolic  beasts  or  birds,  as  their  emblem.  Witness  the  lion  of  the  Great <br/>Mogul  and  the  eagles  of  Caesar  and  Napoleon. <br/><br/><br/>THE  WINGED  GLOBE  OF  EGYPT. <br/><br/><br/>From  Maurice 's  Indian  Antiquities. <br/><br/>This  symbol,  which  appears  over  the  Pylons  or  gates  of  many  Egyptian  palaces  and  temples,  is  emblematic  of  the  three <br/>persons  of  the  Egyptian  Trinity.  The  wings,  the  serpents,  and  the  solar  orb  are  the  insignia  of  Ammon,  Ra,  and  Osiris. <br/><br/>p-  50 <br/><br/>name  implies,  is  also  a  solar  deity.  His  fight  with  the  Nubian  lion,  his  battles  with  the  Philistines,  who <br/>represent  the  Powers  of  Darkness,  and  his  memorable  feat  of  carrying  off  the  gates  of  Gaza,  all  refer <br/>to  aspects  of  solar  activity.  Many  of  the  ancient  peoples  had  more  than  one  solar  deity;  in  fact,  all  of <br/>the  gods  and  goddesses  were  supposed  to  partake,  in  part  at  least,  of  the  sun's  effulgence. <br/><br/><br/>The  golden  ornaments  used  by  the  priestcraft  of  the  various  world  religions  are  again  a  subtle <br/>reference  to  the  solar  energy,  as  are  also  the  crowns  of  kings.  In  ancient  times,  crowns  had  a  number <br/>of  points  extending  outward  like  the  rays  of  the  sun,  but  modern  conventionalism  has,  in  many  cases, <br/>either  removed  the  points  or  else  bent:  them  inward,  gathered  them  together,  and  placed  an  orb  or <br/>cross  upon  the  point  where  they  meet.  Many  of  the  ancient  prophets,  philosophers,  and  dignitaries <br/>carried  a  scepter,  the  upper  end  of  which  bore  a  representation  of  the  solar  globe  surrounded  by <br/>emanating  rays.  All  the  kingdoms  of  earth  were  but  copies  of  the  kingdoms  of  Heaven,  and  the <br/>kingdoms  of  Heaven  were  best  symbolized  by  the  solar  kingdom,  in  which  the  sun  was  the  supreme <br/>ruler,  the  planets  his  privy  council,  and  all  Nature  the  subjects  of  his  empire. <br/><br/>Many  deities  have  been  associated  with  the  sun.  The  Greeks  believed  that  Apollo,  Bacchus,  Dionysos, <br/>Sabazius,  Hercules,  Jason,  Ulysses,  Zeus,  Uranus,  and  Vulcan  partook  of  either  the  visible  or  invisible <br/>attributes  of  the  sun.  The  Norwegians  regarded  Balder  the  Beautiful  as  a  solar  deity,  and  Odin  is  often <br/>connected  with  the  celestial  orb,  especially  because  of  his  one  eye.  Among  the  Egyptians,  Osiris,  Ra, <br/>Anubis,  Hermes,  and  even  the  mysterious  Ammon  himself  had  points  of  resemblance  with  the  solar <br/>disc.  Isis  was  the  mother  of  the  sun,  and  even  Typhon,  the  Destroyer,  was  supposed  to  be  a  form  of <br/>solar  energy.  The  Egyptian  sun  myth  finally  centered  around  the  person  of  a  mysterious  deity  called <br/>Serapis.  The  two  Central  American  deities,  Tezcatlipoca  and  Quetzalcoatl,  while  often  associated <br/>with  the  winds,  were  also  undoubtedly  solar  gods. <br/><br/>In  Masonry  the  sun  has  many  symbols.  One  expression  of  the  solar  energy  is  Solomon,  whose  name <br/>SOL-OM-ON  is  the  name  for  the  Supreme  Light  in  three  different  languages.  Hiram  Abiff,  the <br/>CHiram  (Hiram)  of  the  Chaldees,  is  also  a  solar  deity,  and  the  story  of  his  attack  and  murder  by  the <br/>Ruffians,  with  its  solar  interpretation,  will  be  found  in  the  chapter  The  Hiramic  Legend.  A  striking <br/>example  of  the  important  part  which  the  sun  plays  in  the  symbols  and  rituals  of  Freemasonry  is  given <br/>by  George  Oliver,  D.D.,  in  his  Dictionary  of  Symbolical  Masonry,  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;The  sun  rises  in  the  east,  and  in  the  east  is  the  place  for  the  Worshipful  Master.  As  the  sun  is  the <br/>source  of  all  light  and  warmth,  so  should  the  Worshipful  Master  enliven  and  warm  the  brethren  to <br/>their  work.  Among  the  ancient  Egyptians  the  sun  was  the  symbol  of  divine  providence.&quot;  The <br/>hierophants  of  the  Mysteries  were  adorned  with  many,  insignia  emblematic  of  solar  power.  The <br/>sunbursts  of  gilt  embroidery  on  the  back  of  the  vestments  of  the  Catholic  priesthood  signify  that  the <br/>priest  is  also  an  emissary  and  representative  of  Sol  Invictus. <br/><br/>CHRISTIANITY  AND  THE  SUN <br/><br/>For  reasons  which  they  doubtless  considered  sufficient,  those  who  chronicled  the  life  and  acts  of <br/>Jesus  found  it  advisable  to  metamorphose  him  into  a  solar  deity.  The  historical  Jesus  was  forgotten; <br/>nearly  all  the  salient  incidents  recorded  in  the  four  Gospels  have  their  correlations  in  the  movements, <br/>phases,  or  functions  of  the  heavenly  bodies. <br/><br/>Among  other  allegories  borrowed  by  Christianity  from  pagan  antiquity  is  the  story  of  the  beautiful, <br/>blue-eyed  Sun  God,  with  His  golden  hair  falling  upon  His  shoulders,  robed  from  head  to  foot  in <br/>spotless  white  and  carrying  in  His  arms  the  Lamb  of  God,  symbolic  of  the  vernal  equinox.  This <br/>handsome  youth  is  a  composite  of  Apollo,  Osiris,  Orpheus,  Mithras,  and  Bacchus,  for  He  has  certain <br/>characteristics  in  common  with  each  of  these  pagan  deities. <br/><br/>The  philosophers  of  Greece  and  Egypt  divided  the  life  of  the  sun  during  the  year  into  four  parts; <br/>therefore  they  symbolized  the  Solar  Man  by  four  different  figures.  When  He  was  born  in  the  winter <br/>solstice,  the  Sun  God  was  symbolized  as  a  dependent  infant  who  in  some  mysterious  manner  had <br/>managed  to  escape  the  Powers  of  Darkness  seeking  to  destroy  Him  while  He  was  still  in  the  cradle  of <br/>winter.  The  sun,  being  weak  at  this  season  of  the  year,  had  no  golden  rays  (or  locks  of  hair),  but  the <br/>survival  of  the  light  through  the  darkness  of  winter  was  symbolized  by  one  tiny  hair  which  alone <br/><br/><br/>adorned  the  head  of  the  Celestial  Child.  (As  the  birth  of  the  sun  took  place  in  Capricorn,  it  was  often <br/>represented  as  being  suckled  by  a  goat.) <br/><br/>At  the  vernal  equinox,  the  sun  had  grown  to  be  a  beautiful  youth.  His  golden  hair  hung  in  ringlets  on <br/>his  shoulders  and  his  light,  as  Schiller  said,  extended  to  all  parts  of  infinity.  At  the  summer  solstice, <br/>the  sun  became  a  strong  man,  heavily  bearded,  who,  in  the  prime  of  maturity,  symbolized  the  fact <br/>that  Nature  at  this  period  of  the  year  is  strongest  and  most  fecund.  At  the  autumnal  equinox,  the  sun <br/>was  pictured  as  an  aged  man,  shuffling  along  with  bended  back  and  whitened  locks  into  the  oblivion <br/>of  winter  darkness.  Thus,  twelve  months  were  assigned  to  the  sun  as  the  length  of  its  life.  During  this <br/>period  it  circled  the  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac  in  a  magnificent  triumphal  march.  When  fall  came,  it <br/>entered,  like  Samson,  into  the  house  of  Delilah  (Virgo),  where  its  rays  were  cut  off  and  it  lost  its <br/>strength.  In  Masonry,  the  cruel  winter  months  are  symbolized  by  three  murderers  who  sought  to <br/>destroy  the  God  of  Light  and  Truth. <br/><br/>The  coming  of  the  sun  was  hailed  with  joy;  the  time  of  its  departure  was  viewed  as  a  period  to  be  set <br/>aside  for  sorrow  and  unhappiness.  This  glorious,  radiant  orb  of  day,  the  true  light  &quot;which  lighteth <br/>every  man  who  cometh  into  the  world,&quot;  the  supreme  benefactor,  who  raised  all  things  from  the  dead, <br/>who  fed  the  hungry  multitudes,  who  stilled  the  tempest,  who  after  dying  rose  again  and  restored  all <br/>things  to  life&#x2014;this  Supreme  Spirit  of  humanitarianism  and  philanthropy  is  known  to  Christendom  as <br/>Christ,  the  Redeemer  of  worlds,  the  Only  Begotten  of  The  Father,  the  Word  made  Flesh,  and  the  Hope <br/>of  Glory. <br/><br/>THE  BIRTHDAY  OF  THE  SUN <br/><br/>The  pagans  set  aside  the  25th  of  December  as  the  birthday  of  the  Solar  Man.  They  rejoiced,  feasted, <br/>gathered  in  processions,  and  made  offerings  in  the  temples.  The  darkness  of  winter  was  over  and  the <br/>glorious  son  of  light  was  returning  to  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  With  his  last  effort  the  old  Sun  God <br/>had  torn  down  the  house  of  the  Philistines  (the  Spirits  of  Darkness)  and  had  cleared  the  way  for  the <br/>new  sun  who  was  born  that  day  from  the  depths  of  the  earth  amidst  the  symbolic  beasts  of  the  lower <br/>world. <br/><br/>Concerning  this  season  of  celebration,  an  anonymous  Master  of  Arts  of  Balliol  College,  Oxford,  in  his <br/>scholarly  treatise.  Mankind  Their  Origin  and  Destiny,  says:  &quot;The  Romans  also  had  their  solar  festival, <br/>and  their  games  of  the  circus  in  honor  of  the  birth  of  the  god  of  day.  It  took  place  the  eighth  day <br/>before  the  kalends  of  January&#x2014;that  is,  on  December  25.  Servius,  in  his  commentary  on  verse  720  of <br/>the  seventh  book  of  the  ^neid,  in  which  Virgil  speaks  of  the  new  sun,  says  that,  properly  speaking, <br/>the  sun  is  new  on  the  8th  of  the  Kalends  of  January-that  is,  December  25.  In  the  time  of  Leo  I.  (Leo, <br/>Serm.  xxi.,  De  Nativ.  Dom.  p.  148),  some  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Church  said  that  'what  rendered  the <br/>festival  (of  Christmas)  venerable  was  less  the  birth  of  Jesus  Christ  than  the  return,  and,  as  they <br/>expressed  it,  the  new  birth  of  the  sun.'  It  was  on  the  same  day  that  the  birth  of  the  Invincible  Sun <br/>(Natalis  solis  invicti),  was  celebrated  at  Rome,  as  can  be  seen  in  the  Roman  calendars,  published  in <br/>the  reign  of  Constantine  and  of  Julian  (Hymn  to  the  Sun,  p.  155).  This  epithet  Tnvictus'  is  the  same  as <br/>the  Persians  gave  to  this  same  god,  whom  they  worshipped  by  the  name  of  Mithra,  and  whom  they <br/>caused  to  be  born  in  a  grotto  (Justin.  Dial,  cum  Trips,  p.  305),  just  as  he  is  represented  as  being  bom <br/>in  a  stable,  under  the  name  of  Christ,  by  the  Christians.&quot; <br/><br/>Concerning  the  Catholic  Feast  of  the  Assumption  and  its  parallel  in  astronomy,  the  same  author  adds: <br/>&quot;At  the  end  of  eight  months,  when  the  sun-god,  having  increased,  traverses  the  eighth  sign,  he <br/>absorbs  the  celestial  Virgin  in  his  fiery  course,  and  she  disappears  in  the  midst  of  the  luminous  rays <br/>and  the  glory  of  her  son.  This  phenomenon,  which  takes  place  every  year  about  the  middle  of  August, <br/>gave  rise  to  a  festival  which  still  exists,  and  in  which  it  is  supposed  that  the  mother  of  Christ,  laying <br/>aside  her  earthly  life,  is  associated  with  the  glory  of  her  son,  and  is  placed  at  his  side  in  the  heavens. <br/>The  Roman  calendar  of  Columella  (Col.  1.  II.  cap.  ii.  p.  429)  marks  the  death  or  disappearance  of <br/><br/><br/>Virgo  at  this  period.  The  sun,  he  says,  passes  into  Virgo  on  the  thirteenth  day  before  the  kalends  of <br/>September.  This  is  where  the  Cathohcs  place  the  Feast  of  the  Assumption,  or  the  reunion  of  the  Virgin <br/>to  her  Son.  This  feast <br/><br/><br/>THE  THREE  SUNS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Lilly's  Astrological  Predictions  for  1648, 1649,  and  1650.) <br/><br/>The  following  description  of  this  phenomenon  appears  in  a  letter  written  by  Jeremiah  Shakerley  in  Lancashire,  March  4th, <br/>i648:~&quot;On  Monday  the  28th  of  February  last,  there  arose  with  the  Sun  two  Parelii,  on  either  side  one;  their  distance  from <br/>him  was  by  estimation,  about  ten  degrees;  they  continued  still  of  the  same  distance  from  the  Zenith,  or  height  above  the <br/>Horizon,  that  the  Sun  did;  and  from  the  parts  averse  to  the  Sun,  there  seemed  to  issue  out  certain  bright  rays,  not  unlike <br/>those  which  the  Sun  sendeth  from  behind  a  cloud,  but  brighter.  The  parts  of  these  Parelii  which  were  toward  the  Sun, <br/>were  of  a  mixt  colour,  wherein  green  and  red  were  most  predominant.  A  little  above  them  was  a  thin  rainbow,  scarcely <br/>discernible,  of  a  bright  colour,  with  the  concave  towards  the  Sun,  and  the  ends  thereof  seeming  to  touch  the  Parelii:  Above <br/>that,  in  a  clear  diaphanous  ayr,  [air],  appeared  another  conspicuous  Rainbow,  beautified  with  divers  colours;  it  was  as <br/>neer  as  I  could  discern  to  the  Zenith;  it  seemed  of  something  a  lesser  radius  than  the  other,  they  being  back  to  back,  yet  a <br/>pretty  way  between.  At  or  neer  the  apparent  time  of  the  full  Moon,  they  vanished,  leaving  abundance  of  terror  and <br/>amazement  in  those  that  saw  them.  (See  William  Lilly.) <br/><br/>p-  51 <br/><br/>was  formerly  called  the  feast  of  the  Passage  of  the  Virgin  (Beausobre,  tome  i.  p.  350);  and  in  the <br/>Library  of  the  Fathers  (Bibl.  Part.  vol.  II.  part  ii.  p.  212)  we  have  an  account  of  the  Passage  of  the <br/>Blessed  Virgin.  The  ancient  Greeks  and  Romans  fix  the  assumption  of  Astraea,  who  is  also  this  same <br/>Virgin,  on  that  day.&quot; <br/><br/>This  Virgin  mother,  giving  birth  to  the  Sun  God  which  Christianity  has  so  faithfully  preserved,  is  a <br/>reminder  of  the  inscription  concerning  her  Egyptian  prototype,  Isis,  which  appeared  on  the  Temple  of <br/>Sais:  &quot;The  fruit  which  I  have  brought  forth  is  the  Sun.&quot;  While  the  Virgin  was  associated  with  the <br/>moon  by  the  early  pagans,  there  is  no  doubt  that  they  also  understood  her  position  as  a  constellation <br/>in  the  heavens,  for  nearly  all  the  peoples  of  antiquity  credit  her  as  being  the  mother  of  the  sun,  and <br/>they  realized  that  although  the  moon  could  not  occupy  that  position,  the  sign  of  Virgo  could,  and  did, <br/>give  birth  to  the  sun  out  of  her  side  on  the  25th  day  of  December.  Albertus  Magnus  states,  &quot;We  know <br/>that  the  sign  of  the  Celestial  Virgin  rose  over  the  Horizon  at  the  moment  at  which  we  fix  the  birth  of <br/>our  Lord  Jesus  Christ. <br/><br/>Among  certain  of  the  Arabian  and  Persian  astronomers  the  three  stars  forming  the  sword  belt  of <br/>Orion  were  called  the  Magi  who  came  to  pay  homage  to  the  young  Sun  God.  The  author  of  Mankind&#x2014; <br/>Their  Origin  and  Destiny  contributes  the  following  additional  information:  &quot;In  Cancer,  which  had <br/>risen  to  the  meridian  at  midnight,  is  the  constellation  of  the  Stable  and  of  the  Ass.  The  ancients  called <br/>it  Prgesepe  Jovis.  In  the  north  the  stars  of  the  Bear  are  seen,  called  by  the  Arabians  Martha  and  Mary, <br/>and  also  the  coffin  of  Lazarus.  &quot;Thus  the  esotericism  of  pagandom  was  embodied  in  Christianity, <br/><br/><br/>although  its  keys  are  lost.  The  Christian  church  blindly  follows  ancient  customs,  and  when  asked  for  a <br/>reason  gives  superficial  and  unsatisfactory  explanations,  either  forgetting  or  ignoring  the  indisputable <br/>fact  that  each  religion  is  based  upon  the  secret  doctrines  of  its  predecessor. <br/><br/>THE  THREE  SUNS <br/><br/>The  solar  orb,  like  the  nature  of  man,  was  divided  by  the  ancient  sages  into  three  separate  bodies. <br/>According  to  the  mystics,  there  are  three  suns  in  each  solar  system,  analogous  to  the  three  centers  of <br/>life  in  each  individual  constitution.  These  are  called  three  lights:  the  spiritual  sun,  the  intellectual  or <br/>soular  sun,  and  the  material  sun  (now  symbolized  in  Freemasonry  by  three  candles).  The  spiritual <br/>sun  manifests  the  power  of  God  the  Father;  the  soular  sun  radiates  the  life  of  God  the  Son;  and  the <br/>material  sun  is  the  vehicle  of  manifestation  for  God  the  Holy  Spirit.  Man's  nature  was  divided  by  the <br/>mystics  into  three  distinct  parts:  spirit,  soul,  and  body.  His  physical  body  was  unfolded  and  vitalized <br/>by  the  material  sun;  his  spiritual  nature  was  illuminated  by  the  spiritual  sun;  and  his  intellectual <br/>nature  was  redeemed  by  the  true  light  of  grace&#x2014; the  soular  sun.  The  alignment  of  these  three  globes <br/>in  the  heavens  was  one  explanation  offered  for  the  peculiar  fact  that  the  orbits  of  the  planets  are  not <br/>circular  but  elliptical. <br/><br/>The  pagan  priests  always  considered  the  solar  system  as  a  Grand  Man,  and  drew  their  analogy  of <br/>these  three  centers  of  activity  from  the  three  main  centers  of  life  in  the  human  body:  the  brain,  the <br/>heart,  and  the  generative  system.  The  Transfiguration  of  Jesus  describes  three  tabernacles,  the  largest <br/>being  in  the  center  (the  heart),  and  a  smaller  one  on  either  side  (the  brain  and  the  generative  system). <br/>It  is  possible  that  the  philosophical  hypothesis  of  the  existence  of  the  three  suns  is  based  upon  a <br/>peculiar  natural  phenomenon  which  has  occurred  many  times  in  history.  In  the  fifty-  first  year  after <br/>Christ  three  suns  were  seen  at  once  in  the  sky  and  also  in  the  sixty-sixth  year.  In  the  sixty-ninth  year, <br/>two  suns  were  seen  together.  According  to  William  Lilly,  between  the  years  1156  and  1648  twenty <br/>similar  occurrences  were  recorded. <br/><br/>Recognizing  the  sun  as  the  supreme  benefactor  of  the  material  world,  Hermetists  believed  that  there <br/>was  a  spiritual  sun  which  ministered  to  the  needs  of  the  invisible  and  divine  part  of  Nature&#x2014;human <br/>and  universal.  Anent  this  subject,  the  great  Paracelsus  wrote:  &quot;There  is  an  earthly  sun,  which  is  the <br/>cause  of  all  heat,  and  all  who  are  able  to  see  may  see  the  sun;  and  those  who  are  blind  and  cannot  see <br/>him  may  feel  his  heat.  There  is  an  Eternal  Sun,  which  is  the  source  of  all  wisdom,  and  those  whose <br/>spiritual  senses  have  awakened  to  life  will  see  that  sun  and  be  conscious  of  His  existence;  but  those <br/>who  have  not  attained  spiritual  consciousness  may  yet  feel  His  power  by  an  inner  faculty  which  is <br/>called  Intuition.&quot; <br/><br/>Certain  Rosicrucian  scholars  have  given  special  appellations  to  these  three  phases  of  the  sun:  the <br/>spiritual  sun  they  called  Vulcan;  the  soular  and  intellectual  sun,  Christ  and  Lucifer  respectively;  and <br/>the  material  sun,  the  Jewish  Demiurgus  Jehovah.  Lucifer  here  represents  the  intellectual  mind <br/>without  the  illumination  of  the  spiritual  mind;  therefore  it  is  &quot;the  false  light. &quot;  The  false  light  is  finally <br/>overcome  and  redeemed  by  the  true  light  of  the  soul,  called  the  Second  Logos  or  Christ.  The  secret <br/>processes  by  which  the  Luciferian  intellect  is  transmuted  into  the  Christly  intellect  constitute  one  of <br/>the  great  secrets  of  alchemy,  and  are  symbolized  by  the  process  of  transmuting  base  metals  into  gold. <br/><br/>In  the  rare  treatise  The  Secret  Symbols  of  The  Rosicrucians,  Franz  Hartmann  defines  the  sun <br/>alchemically  as:  &quot;The  symbol  of  Wisdom.  The  Centre  of  Power  or  Heart  of  things.  The  Sun  is  a  centre <br/>of  energy  and  a  storehouse  of  power.  Each  living  being  contains  within  itself  a  centre  of  life,  which <br/>may  grow  to  be  a  Sun.  In  the  heart  of  the  regenerated,  the  divine  power,  stimulated  by  the  Light  of  the <br/>Logos,  grows  into  a  Sun  which  illuminates  his  mind.&quot;  In  a  note,  the  same  author  amplifies  his <br/>description  by  adding:  &quot;The  terrestrial  sun  is  the  image  or  reflection  of  the  invisible  celestial  sun;  the <br/>former  is  in  the  realm  of  Spirit  what  the  latter  is  in  the  realm  of  Matter;  but  the  latter  receives  its <br/>power  from  the  former.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  reUgions  of  antiquity  agree  that  the  material  visible  sun  was  a  reflector <br/><br/>rather  than  a  source  of  power.  The  sun  was  sometimes  represented  as  a  shield  carried  on  the  arm  of <br/>the  Sun  God,  as  for  example,  Frey,  the  Scandinavian  Solar  Deity.  This  sun  reflected  the  light  of  the <br/>invisible  spiritual  sun,  which  was  the  true  source  of  life,  light,  and  truth.  The  physical  nature  of  the <br/>universe  is  receptive;  it  is  a  realm  of  effects.  The  invisible  causes  of  these  effects  belong  to  the  spiritual <br/>world.  Hence,  the  spiritual  world  is  the  sphere  of  causation;  the  material  world  is  the  sphere  of  effects; <br/>while  the  intellectual&#x2014;or  soul&#x2014;world  is  the  sphere  of  mediation.  Thus  Christ,  the  personified  higher <br/>intellect  and  soul  nature,  is  called  &quot;the  Mediator&quot;  who,  by  virtue  of  His  position  and  power,  says:  &quot;No <br/>man  cometh  to  the  Father,  but  by  me.&quot; <br/><br/>What  the  sun  is  to  the  solar  system,  the  spirit  is  to  the  bodies  of  man;  for  his  natures,  organs,  and <br/>functions  are  as  planets  surrounding  the  central  life  (or  sun)  and  living  upon  its  emanations.  The <br/>solar  power  in  man  is  divided  into  three  parts,  which  are  termed  the  threefold  human  spirit  of  man. <br/>All  three  of  these  spiritual  natures  are  said  to  be  radiant  and  transcendent;  united,  they  form  the <br/>Divinity  in  man.  Man's  threefold  lower  nature&#x2014; consisting  of  his  physical  organism,  his  emotional <br/>nature,  and  his  mental  faculties&#x2014; reflects  the  light  of  his  threefold  Divinity  and  bears  witness  of  It  in <br/>the  physical  world.  Man's  three  bodies  are  symbolized  by  an  upright  triangle;  his  threefold  spiritual <br/>nature  by  an  inverted  triangle.  These  two  triangles,  when  united  in  the  form  of  a  six-pointed  star, <br/>were  called  by  the  Jews  &quot;the  Star  of  David,&quot;  &quot;the  Signet  of  Solomon,&quot;  and  are  more  commonly  known <br/>today  as  &quot;the  Star  of  Zion.&quot;  These  triangles  symbolize  the  spiritual  and  material  universes  linked <br/>together  in  the  constitution  of  the  human  creature,  who  partakes  of  both  Nature  and  Divinity.  Man's <br/>animal  nature  partakes  of  the  earth;  his  divine  nature  of  the  heavens;  his  human  nature  of  the <br/>mediator. <br/><br/>THE  CELESTIAL  INHABITANTS  OF  THE  SUN <br/><br/>The  Rosicrucians  and  the  lUuminati,  describing  the  angels,  archangels,  and  other  celestial  creatures, <br/>declared  that  they  resembled  small  suns,  being  centers  of  radiant  energy  surrounded  by  streamers  of <br/>Vrilic  force.  From  these  outpouring  streamers  of  force  is  derived  the  popular  belief  that  angels  have <br/>wings.  These  wings  are  corona-like  fans  of  light,  by  means  of  which  the  celestial  creatures  propel <br/>themselves  through  the  subtle  essences  of  the  superphysical  worlds. <br/><br/>True  mystics  are  unanimous  in  their  denial  of  the  theory  that  the  angels  and  archangels  are  human  in <br/>form,  as  so  often  pictured.  A  human  figure  would  be  utterly  useless  in  the  ethereal  substances <br/>through  which  they  manifest.  Science  has  long  debated  the  probability  of  the  other  planers  being <br/>inhabited.  Objections  to  the  idea  are  based  upon  the  argument  that  creatures  with  human  organisms <br/>could  nor  possibly  exist  in  the  environments  of  Mars,  Jupiter,  Uranus,  and  Neptune.  This  argument <br/>fails  to  take  into  account  Nature's  universal  law  of  adjustment  to  environment.  The  ancients  asserted <br/>that  life  originated  from  the  sun,  and  that  everything  when  bathed  in  the  light  of  the  solar  orb  was <br/>capable  of  absorbing  the  solar  life  elements  and  later  radiating  them  as  flora  and  fauna.  One <br/>philosophical <br/><br/><br/>Moor  describes  this  figure  as  follows:  &quot;The  cast  is  nine  inches  in  height,  representing  the  glorious  god  of  day-holding  the <br/>attributes  of  VISHNU,  seated  on  a  seven-headed  serpent;  his  car  drawn  by  a  seven-headed  horse,  driven  by  the  legless <br/>ARUN,  a  personification  of  the  dawn,  or  AURORA.&quot;  (See  Moor's  Hindu  Pantheon.) <br/><br/>p-  52 <br/><br/>concept  regarded  the  sun  as  a  parent  and  the  planers  as  embryos  still  connected  to  the  solar  body  by <br/>means  of  ethereal  umbilical  cords  which  served  as  channels  to  convey  life  and  nourishment  to  the <br/>planets. <br/><br/>Some  secret  orders  have  taught  that  the  sun  was  inhabited  by  a  race  of  creatures  with  bodies <br/>composed  of  a  radiant,  spiritual  ether  not  unlike  in  its  constituency  the  actual  glowing  ball  of  the  sun <br/>itself.  The  solar  heat  had  no  harmful  effect  upon  them,  because  their  organisms  were  sufficiently <br/>refined  and  sensitized  to  harmonize  with  the  sun's  tremendous  vibratory  rate.  These  creatures <br/>resemble  miniature  suns,  being  a  little  larger  than  a  dinner  plate  in  size,  although  some  of  the  more <br/>powerful  are  considerably  larger.  Their  color  is  the  golden  white  light  of  the  sun,  and  from  them <br/>emanate  four  streamers  of  Vril.  These  streamers  are  often  of  great  length  and  are  in  constant  motion. <br/>A  peculiar  palpitation  is  to  be  noted  throughout  the  structure  of  the  globe  and  is  communicated  in  the <br/>form  of  ripples  to  the  emanating  streamers.  The  greatest  and  most  luminous  of  these  spheres  is  the <br/>Archangel  Michael;  and  the  entire  order  of  solar  life,  which  resemble  him  and  dwell  upon  the  sun,  are <br/>called  by  modern  Christians  &quot;the  archangels&quot;  or  &quot;the  spirits  of  the  light. <br/><br/>THE  SUN  IN  ALCHEMICAL  SYMBOLOGY <br/><br/>Gold  is  the  metal  of  the  sun  and  has  been  considered  by  many  as  crystallized  sunlight.  When  gold  is <br/>mentioned  in  alchemical  tracts,  it  may  be  either  the  metal  itself  or  the  celestial  orb  which  is  the  source, <br/>or  spirit,  of  gold.  Sulphur  because  of  its  fiery  nature  was  also  associated  with  the  sun. <br/><br/><br/>As  gold  was  the  symbol  of  spirit  and  the  base  metals  represented  man's  lower  nature,  certain <br/><br/>alchemists  were  called  &quot;miners&quot;  and  were  pictured  with  picks  and  shovels  digging  into  the  earth  in <br/>search  of  the  precious  metal&#x2014;those  finer  traits  of  character  buried  in  the  earthiness  of  materiality  and <br/>ignorance.  The  diamond  concealed  in  the  heart  of  the  black  carbon  illustrated  the  same  principle.  The <br/>Illuminati  used  a  pearl  hidden  in  the  shell  of  an  oyster  at  the  bottom  of  the  sea  to  signify  spiritual <br/>powers.  Thus  the  seeker  after  truth  became  a  pearl-fisher:  he  descended  into  the  sea  of  material <br/>illusion  in  search  of  understanding,  termed  by  the  initiates  &quot;the  Pearl  of  Great  Price.&quot; <br/><br/>When  the  alchemists  stated  that  every  animate  and  inanimate  thing  in  the  universe  contained  the <br/>seeds  of  gold,  they  meant  that  even  the  grains  of  sand  possessed  a  spiritual  nature,  for  gold  was  the <br/>spirit  of  all  things.  Concerning  these  seeds  of  spiritual  gold  the  following  Rosicrucian  axiom  is <br/>significant:  &quot;A  seed  is  useless  and  impotent  unless  it  is  put  in  its  appropriate  matrix.&quot;  Franz <br/>Hartmann  comments  on  this  axiom  with  these  illuminating  words:  &quot;A  soul  cannot  develop  and <br/>progress  without  an  appropriate  body,  because  it  is  the  physical  body  that  furnishes  the  material  for <br/>its  development.&quot;  (See  In  the  Pronaos  of  the  Temple  of  Wisdom.) <br/><br/>The  purpose  of  alchemy  was  not  to  make  something  out  of  nothing  but  rather  to  fertilize  and  nurture <br/>the  seed  which  was  already  present.  Its  processes  did  nor  actually  create  gold  but  rather  made  the <br/>ever-present  seed  of  gold  grow  and  flourish.  Everything  which  exists  has  a  spirit&#x2014;the  seed  of  Divinity <br/>within  itself&#x2014; and  regeneration  is  not  the  process  of  attempting  to  place  something  where  it  previously <br/>had  not  existed.  Regeneration  actually  means  the  unfoldment  of  the  omnipresent  Divinity  in  man, <br/>that  this  Divinity  may  shine  forth  as  a  sun  and  illumine  all  with  whom  it  comes  in  contact. <br/><br/>THE  MIDNIGHT  SUN <br/><br/>Apuleius  said  when  describing  his  initiation  (vide  ante):  &quot;At  midnight  I  saw  the  sun  shining  with  a <br/>splendid  light.&quot;  The  midnight  sun  was  also  part  of  the  mystery  of  alchemy.  It  symbolized  the  spirit  in <br/>man  shining  through  the  darkness  of  his  human  organisms.  It  also  referred  to  the  spiritual  sun  in  the <br/>solar  system,  which  the  mystic  could  see  as  well  at  midnight  as  at  high  noon,  the  material  earth  bring <br/>powerless  to  obstruct  the  rays  of  this  Divine  orb.  The  mysterious  lights  which  illuminated  the  temples <br/>of  the  Egyptian  Mysteries  during  the  nocturnal  hours  were  said  by  some  to  he  reflections  of  the <br/>spiritual  sun  gathered  by  the  magical  powers  of  the  priests.  The  weird  light  seen  ten  miles  below  the <br/>surface  of  the  earth  by  I-AM-THE-MAN  in  that  remarkable  Masonic  allegory  Etidorhpa  (Aphrodite <br/>spelt  backward)  may  well  refer  to  the  mysterious  midnight  sun  of  the  ancient  rites. <br/><br/>Primitive  conceptions  concerning  the  warfare  between  the  principles  of  Good  and  Evil  were  often <br/>based  upon  the  alternations  of  day  and  night.  During  the  Middle  Ages,  the  practices  of  black  magic <br/>were  confined  to  the  nocturnal  hours;  and  those  who  served  the  Spirit  of  Evil  were  called  black <br/>magicians,  while  those  who  served  the  Spirit  of  Good  were  called  white  magicians.  Black  and  white <br/>were  associated  respectively  with  night  and  day,  and  the  endless  conflict  of  light  and  shadow  is <br/>alluded  to  many  times  in  the  mythologies  of  various  peoples. <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  Demon,  Typhon,  was  symbolized  as  part  crocodile  and  part:  hog  because  these  animals <br/>are  gross  and  earthy  in  both  appearance  and  temperament.  Since  the  world  began,  living  things  have <br/>feared  the  darkness;  those  few  creatures  who  use  it  as  a  shield  for  their  maneuvers  were  usually <br/>connected  with  the  Spirit  of  Evil.  Consequently  cats,  bats,  toads,  and  owls  are  associated  with <br/>witchcraft.  In  certain  parts  of  Europe  it  is  still  believed  that  at  night  black  magicians  assume  the <br/>bodies  of  wolves  and  roam  around  destroying.  From  this  notion  originated  the  stories  of  the <br/>werewolves.  Serpents,  because  they  lived  in  the  earth,  were  associated  with  the  Spirit  of  Darkness.  As <br/>the  battle  between  Good  and  Evil  centers  around  the  use  of  the  generative  forces  of  Nature,  winged <br/>serpents  represent  the  regeneration  of  the  animal  nature  of  man  or  those  Great  Ones  in  whom  this <br/>regeneration  is  complete.  Among  the  Egyptians  the  sun's  rays  are  often  shown  ending  in  human <br/><br/><br/>hands.  Masons  will  find  a  connection  between  these  hands  and  the  well-known  Paw  of  the  Lion  which <br/>raises  all  things  to  life  with  its  grip. <br/><br/>SOLAR  COLORS <br/><br/>The  theory  so  long  held  of  three  primary  and  four  secondary  colors  is  purely  exoteric,  for  since  the <br/>earliest  periods  it  has  been  known  that  there  are  seven,  and  not  three,  primary  colors,  the  human  eye <br/>being  capable  of  estimating  only  three  of  them.  Thus,  although  green  can  be  made  by  combining  blue <br/>and  yellow,  there  is  also  a  true  or  primary  green  which  is  not  a  compound.  This  can  he  proved  by <br/>breaking  up  the  spectrum  with  a  prism.  Helmholtz  found  that  the  so-called  secondary  colors  of  the <br/>spectrum  could  not  be  broken  up  into  their  supposed  primary  colors.  Thus  the  orange  of  the  spectrum, <br/>if  passed  through  a  second  prism,  does  not  break  up  into  red  and  yellow  but  remains  orange. <br/><br/>Consciousness,  intelligence,  and  force  are  fittingly  symbolized  by  the  colors  blue,  yellow,  and  red.  The <br/><br/>therapeutic  effects  of  the  colors,  moreover,  are  in  harmony  with  this  concept,  for  blue  is  a  fine, <br/>soothing,  electrical  color;  yellow,  a  vitalizing  and  refining  color;  and  red,  an  agitating  and  heat-giving <br/>color.  It  has  also  been  demonstrated  that  minerals  and  plants  affect  the  human  constitution  according <br/>to  their  colors.  Thus  a  yellow  flower  generally  yields  a  medicine  that  affects  the  constitution  in  a <br/>manner  similar  to  yellow  light  or  the  musical  tone  mi.  An  orange  flower  will  influence  in  a  manner <br/>similar  to  orange  light  and,  being  one  of  the  so-called  secondary  colors,  corresponds  either  to  the  tone <br/>re  or  to  the  chord  of  do  and  mi. <br/><br/>The  ancients  conceived  the  spirit  of  man  to  correspond  with  the  color  blue,  the  mind  with  yellow,  and <br/>the  body  with  red.  Heaven  is  therefore  blue,  earth  yellow,  and  hell~or  the  underworld&#x2014;red.  The  fiery <br/>condition  of  the  inferno  merely  symbolizes  the  nature  of  the  sphere  or  plane  of  force  of  which  it  is <br/>composed.  In  the  Greek  Mysteries  the  irrational  sphere  was  always  considered  as  red,  for  it <br/>represented  that  condition  in  which  the  consciousness  is  enslaved  by  the  lusts  and  passions  of  the <br/>lower  nature.  In  India  certain  of  the  gods&#x2014;usually  attributes  of  Vishnu&#x2014; are  depicted  with  blue  skin  to <br/>signify  their  divine  and  supermundane  constitution.  According  to  esoteric  philosophy,  blue  is  the  true <br/>and  sacred  color  of  the  sun.  The  apparent  orange-yellow  shade  of  this  orb  is  the  result  of  its  rays  being <br/>immersed  in  the  substances  of  the  illusionary  world. <br/><br/>In  the  original  symbolism  of  the  Christian  Church,  colors  were  of  first  importance  and  their  use  was <br/>regulated  according  to  carefully  prepared  rules.  Since  the  Middle  Ages,  however,  the  carelessness <br/>with  which  colors  have  been  employed  has  resulted  in  the  loss  of  their  deeper  emblematic  meanings. <br/>In  its  primary  aspect,  white  or  silver  signified  life,  purity,  innocence,  joy,  and  light;  red,  the  suffering <br/>and  death  of  Christ  and  His  saints,  and  also  divine  love,  blood,  and  warfare  or  suffering;  blue,  the <br/>heavenly  sphere  and  the  states  of  godliness  and  contemplation;  yellow  or  gold,  glory,  fruitfulness,  and <br/>goodness;  green,  fecundity,  youthfulness,  and  prosperity;  violet,  humility,  deep  affection,  and  sorrow; <br/>black,  death,  destruction,  and  humiliation.  In  early  church  art  the  colors  of  robes  and  ornaments  also <br/>revealed  whether  a  saint  had  been  martyred,  as  well  as  the  character  of  the  work  that  he  had  done  to <br/>deserve  canonization. <br/><br/>In  addition  to  the  colors  of  the  spectrum  there  are  a  vast  number  of  vibratory  color  waves,  some  too <br/>low  and  others  too  high  to  be  registered  by  the  human  optical  apparatus.  It  is  appalling  to <br/>contemplate  man's  colossal  ignorance  concerning  these  vistas  of  abstract  space.  As  in  the  past  man <br/>explored  unknown  continents,  so  in  the  future,  armed  with  curious  implements  fashioned  for  the <br/>purpose,  he  will  explore  these  little  known  fastnesses  of  light,  color,  sound,  and  consciousness. <br/><br/><br/>THE  SOLAR  FACE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/><br/>The  corona  of  the  sun  is  here  shown  in  the  form  of  a  hon's  mane.  This  is  a  subtle  reminder  of  the  fact  that  at  one  time  the <br/>summer  solstice  took  place  in  the  sign  of  Leo,  the  Celestial  Lion. <br/><br/><br/>P-  53 <br/><br/><br/>The  Zodiac  and  Its  Signs <br/><br/>IT  is  difficult  for  this  age  to  estimate  correctly  the  profound  effect  produced  upon  the  religions, <br/>philosophies,  and  sciences  of  antiquity  by  the  study  of  the  planets,  luminaries,  and  constellations.  Not <br/>without  adequate  reason  were  the  Magi  of  Persia  called  the  Star  Gazers.  The  Egyptians  were  honored <br/>with  a  special  appellation  because  of  their  proficiency  in  computing  the  power  and  motion  of  the <br/>heavenly  bodies  and  their  effect  upon  the  destinies  of  nations  and  individuals.  Ruins  of  primitive <br/>astronomical  observatories  have  been  discovered  in  all  parts  of  the  world,  although  in  many  cases <br/>modern  archaeologists  are  unaware  of  the  true  purpose  for  which  these  structures  were  erected.  While <br/>the  telescope  was  unknown  to  ancient  astronomers,  they  made  many  remarkable  calculations  with <br/>instruments  cut  from  blocks  of  granite  or  pounded  from  sheets  of  brass  and  cop  per.  In  India  such <br/>instruments  are  still  in  use,  and  they  posses  a  high  degree  of  accuracy.  In  Jaipur,  Rajputana,  India,  an <br/>observatory  consisting  largely  of  immense  stone  sundials  is  still  in  operation.  The  famous  Chinese <br/>observatory  on  the  wall  of  Peking  consists  of  immense  bronze  instruments,  including  a  telescope  in <br/>the  form  of  a  hollow  tube  without  lenses. <br/><br/>The  pagans  looked  upon  the  stars  as  living  things,  capable  of  influencing  the  destinies  of  individuals, <br/>nations,  and  races.  That  the  early  Jewish  patriarchs  believed  that  the  celestial  bodies  participated  in <br/>the  affairs  of  men  is  evident  to  any  student  of  Biblical  literature,  as,  for  example,  in  the  Book  of <br/>Judges:  &quot;They  fought  from  heaven,  even  the  stars  in  their  courses  fought  against  Sisera.&quot;  The <br/>Chaldeans,  Phoenicians,  Egyptians,  Persians,  Hindus,  and  Chinese  all  had  zodiacs  that  were  much <br/>alike  in  general  character,  and  different  authorities  have  credited  each  of  these  nations  with  being  the <br/>cradle  of  astrology  and  astronomy.  The  Central  and  North  American  Indians  also  had  an <br/>understanding  of  the  zodiac,  but  the  patterns  and  numbers  of  the  signs  differed  in  many  details  from <br/>those  of  the  Eastern  Hemisphere. <br/><br/>The  word  zodiac  is  derived  from  the  Greek  ^coSiaKog  (zodiakos),  which  means  &quot;a  circle  of  animals,&quot;  or, <br/>as  some  believe,  &quot;little  animals.&quot;  It  is  the  name  given  by  the  old  pagan  astronomers  to  a  band  of  fixed <br/>stars  about  sixteen  degrees  wide,  apparently  encircling  the  earth.  Robert  Hewitt  Brown,  32&#x00b0;,  states <br/>that  the  Greek  word  zodiakos  comes  from  zo-on,  meaning  &quot;an  animal.&quot;  He  adds:  &quot;This  latter  word  is <br/>compounded  directly  from  the  primitive  Egyptian  radicals,  zo,  life,  and  on,  a  being.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Greeks,  and  later  other  peoples  influenced  by  their  culture,  divided  the  band  of  the  zodiac  into <br/>twelve  sections,  each  being  sixteen  degrees  in  width  and  thirty  degrees  in  length.  These  divisions  were <br/>called  the  Houses  of  the  Zodiac.  The  sun  during  its  annual  pilgrimage  passed  through  each  of  these  in <br/>turn.  Imaginary  creatures  were  traced  in  the  Star  groups  bounded  by  these  rectangles;  and  because <br/>most  of  them  were  animal&#x2014;or  part  animal&#x2014;in  form,  they  later  became  known  as  the  Constellations, <br/>or  Signs,  of  the  Zodiac. <br/><br/>There  is  a  popular  theory  concerning  the  origin  of  the  zodiacal  creatures  to  the  effect  that  they  were <br/>products  of  the  imagination  of  shepherds,  who,  watching  their  flocks  at  night,  occupied  their  minds <br/>by  tracing  the  forms  of  animals  and  birds  in  the  heavens.  This  theory  is  untenable,  unless  the <br/>&quot;shepherds&quot;  be  regarded  as  the  shepherd  priests  of  antiquity.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  zodiacal  signs <br/>were  derived  from  the  star  groups  which  they  now  represent.  It  is  far  more  probable  that  the <br/>creatures  assigned  to  the  twelve  houses  are  symbolic  of  the  qualities  and  intensity  of  the  sun's  power <br/>while  it  occupies  different  parts  of  the  zodiacal  belt. <br/><br/>On  this  subject  Richard  Payne  Knight  writes:  &quot;The  emblematical  meaning,  which  certain  animals <br/>were  employed  to  signify,  was  only  some  particular  property  generalized;  and,  therefore,  might  easily <br/>be  invented  or  discovered  by  the  natural  operation  of  the  mind:  but  the  collections  of  stars,  named <br/><br/><br/>after  certain  animals,  have  no  resemblance  whatever  to  those  animals;  which  are  therefore  merely <br/>signs  of  convention  adopted  to  distinguish  certain  portions  of  the  heavens,  which  were  probably <br/>consecrated  to  those  particular  personified  attributes,  which  they  respectively  represented.&quot;  {The <br/>Symbolical  Language  of  Ancient  Art  and  Mythology.) <br/><br/>Some  authorities  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  zodiac  was  originally  divided  into  ten  (instead  of  twelve) <br/>houses,  or  &quot;solar  mansions.&quot;  In  early  times  there  were  two  separate  standards&#x2014;one  solar  and  the <br/>other  lunar&#x2014;used  for  the  measurement  of  the  months,  years,  and  seasons.  The  solar  year  was <br/>composed  of  ten  months  of  thirty-six  days  each,  and  five  days  sacred  to  the  gods.  The  lunar  year <br/>consisted  of  thirteen  months  of  twenty-eight  days  each,  with  one  day  left  over.  The  solar  zodiac  at  that <br/>time  consisted  often  houses  of  thirty-six  degrees  each. <br/><br/>The  first  six  signs  of  the  zodiac  of  twelve  signs  were  regarded  as  benevolent,  because  the  sun  occupied <br/>them  while  traversing  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  The  6,000  years  during  which,  according  to  the <br/>Persians,  Ahura-Mazda  ruled  His  universe  in  harmony  and  peace,  were  symbolic  of  these  six  signs. <br/>The  second  six  were  considered  malevolent,  because  while  the  sun  was  traveling  the  Southern <br/>Hemisphere  it  was  winter  with  the  Greeks,  Egyptians,  and  Persians.  Therefore  these  six  months <br/>symbolic  of  the  6,000  years  of  misery  and  suffering  caused  by  the  evil  genius  of  the  Persians, <br/>Ahriman,  who  sought  to  overthrow  the  power  of  Ahura-Mazda. <br/><br/>Those  who  hold  the  opinion  that  before  its  revision  by  the  Greeks  the  zodiac  consisted  of  only  ten <br/>signs  adduce  evidence  to  show  that  Libra  (the  Scales)  was  inserted  into  the  zodiac  by  dividing  the <br/>constellation  of  Virgo  Scorpio  (at  that  time  one  sign)  into  two  parts,  thus  establishing  &quot;the  balance&quot;  at <br/>the  point  of  equilibrium  between  the  ascending  northern  and  the  descending  southern  signs.  (See  The <br/>Rosicrucians,  Their  Rites  and  Mysteries,  by  Hargrave  Jennings.)  On  this  subject  Isaac  Myer  states: <br/>&quot;We  think  that  the  Zodiacal  constellations  were  first  ten  and  represented  an  immense  androgenic <br/>man  or  deity;  subsequently  this  was  changed,  resulting  in  Scorpio  and  Virgo  and  making  eleven;  after <br/>this  from  Scorpio,  Libra,  the  Balance,  was  taken,  making  the  present  twelve.&quot;  {The  Qabbalah.) <br/><br/>Each  year  the  sun  passes  entirely  around  the  zodiac  and  returns  to  the  point  from  which  it  started&#x2014; <br/>the  vernal  equinox&#x2014; and  each  year  it  falls  just  a  little  short  of  making  the  complete  circle  of  the <br/>heavens  in  the  allotted  period  of  time.  As  a  result,  it  crosses  the  equator  just  a  little  behind  the  spot  in <br/>the  zodiacal  sign  where  it  crossed  the  previous  year.  Each  sign  of  the  zodiac  consists  of  thirty  degrees, <br/>and  as  the  sun  loses  about  one  degree  every  seventy  two  years,  it  regresses  through  one  entire <br/>constellation  (or  sign)  in  approximately  2,160  years,  and  through  the  entire  zodiac  in  about  [paragraph <br/><br/>continues] <br/><br/><br/>CHART  SHOWING  THE  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  THE  HUMAN  BODY  AND  THE  EXTERIOR  UNIVERSE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  (Edipus  Mgyptiacus. <br/><br/><br/>The  ornamental  border  contains  groups  of  names  of  animal,  mineral,  and  vegetable  substances.  Their  relationship  to <br/>corresponding  parts  of  the  human  body  is  shown  by  the  dotted  lines.  The  words  in  capital  letters  on  the  dotted  lines <br/>indicate  to  what  corporeal  member,  organ,  or  disease,  the  herb  or  other  substance  is  related.  The  favorable  positions  in <br/>relation  to  the  time  of  year  are  shown  by  the  signs  of  the  zodiac,  each  house  of  which  is  divided  by  crosses  into  its  three <br/>decans.  This  influence  is  further  emphasized  by  the  series  of  planetary  signs  placed  on  either  side  of  the  figure. <br/><br/><br/>The  plane  of  the  zodiac  intersects  the  celestial  equator  at  an  angle  of  approximately  23&#x00b0;  28'.  The  two  points  of  intersection <br/>(A  and  B)  are  called  the  equinoxes. <br/><br/><br/>25,920  years.  (Authorities  disagree  concerning  these  figures.)  This  retrograde  motion  is  called  the <br/>precession  of  the  equinoxes.  This  means  that  in  the  course  of  about  25,920  years,  which  constitute <br/><br/><br/>THE  EQUINOXES  AND  SOLSTICES. <br/><br/><br/>P-  54 <br/><br/><br/>one  Great  Solar  or  Platonic  Year,  each  one  of  the  twelve  constellations  occupies  a  position  at  the <br/>vernal  equinox  for  nearly  2,160  years,  then  gives  place  to  the  previous  sign. <br/><br/>Among  the  ancients  the  sun  was  always  symbolized  by  the  figure  and  nature  of  the  constellation <br/>through  which  it  passed  at  the  vernal  equinox.  For  nearly  the  past  2,000  years  the  sun  has  crossed  the <br/>equator  at  the  vernal  equinox  in  the  constellation  of  Pisces  (the  Two  Fishes).  For  the  2,160  years <br/>before  that  it  crossed  through  the  constellation  of  Aries  (the  Ram).  Prior  to  that  the  vernal  equinox <br/>was  in  the  sign  of  Taurus  (the  Bull).  It  is  probable  that  the  form  of  the  bull  and  the  bull's  proclivities <br/>were  assigned  to  this  constellation  because  the  bull  was  used  by  the  ancients  to  plow  the  fields,  and <br/>the  season  set  aside  for  plowing  and  furrowing  corresponded  to  the  time  at  which  the  sun  reached  the <br/>segment  of  the  heavens  named  Taurus. <br/><br/>Albert  Pike  describes  the  reverence  which  the  Persians  felt  for  this  sign  and  the  method  of  astrological <br/>symbolism  in  vogue  among  them,  thus:  &quot;In  Zoroaster's  cave  of  initiation,  the  Sun  and  Planets  were <br/>represented,  overhead,  in  gems  and  gold,  as  was  also  the  Zodiac.  The  Sun  appeared,  emerging  from <br/>the  back  of  Taurus. &quot;  In  the  constellation  of  the  Bull  are  also  to  be  found  the  &quot;Seven  Sisters&quot;~the <br/>sacred  Pleiades&#x2014;famous  to  Freemasonry  as  the  Seven  Stars  at  the  upper  end  of  the  Sacred  Ladder. <br/><br/>In  ancient  Egypt  it  was  during  this  period&#x2014; when  the  vernal  equinox  was  in  the  sign  of  Taurus&#x2014; that <br/>the  Bull,  Apis,  was  sacred  to  the  Sun  God,  who  was  worshiped  through  the  animal  equivalent  of  the <br/>celestial  sign  which  he  had  impregnated  with  his  presence  at  the  time  of  its  crossing  into  the  Northern <br/>Hemisphere.  This  is  the  meaning  of  an  ancient  saying  that  the  celestial  Bull  &quot;broke  the  egg  of  the  year <br/>with  his  horns.&quot; <br/><br/>Sampson  Arnold  Mackey,  in  his  Mythological  Astronomy  of  the  Ancients  Demonstrated,  makes  note <br/>of  two  very  interesting  points  concerning  the  bull  in  Egyptian  symbolism.  Mr.  Mackey  is  of  the <br/>opinion  that  the  motion  of  the  earth  that  we  know  as  the  alternation  of  the  poles  has  resulted  in  a <br/>great  change  of  relative  position  of  the  equator  and  the  zodiacal  band.  He  believes  that  originally  the <br/>band  of  the  zodiac  was  at  right  angles  to  the  equator,  with  the  sign  of  Cancer  opposite  the  north  pole <br/>and  the  sign  of  Capricorn  opposite  the  south  pole.  It  is  possible  that  the  Orphic  symbol  of  the  serpent <br/>twisted  around  the  egg  attempts  to  show  the  motion  of  the  sun  in  relation  to  the  earth  under  such <br/>conditions.  Mr.  Mackey  advances  the  Labyrinth  of  Crete,  the  name  Abraxas,  and  the  magic  formula, <br/>abracadabra,  among  other  things,  to  substantiate  his  theory.  Concerning  abracadabra  he  states: <br/><br/>&quot;But  the  slow  progressive  disappearance  of  the  Bull  is  most  happily  commemorated  in  the  vanishing <br/>series  of  letters  so  emphatically  expressive  of  the  great  astronomical  fact.  For  ABRACADABRA  is  The <br/>Bull,  the  only  Bull.  The  ancient  sentence  split  into  its  component  parts  stands  thus:  Ab'r-achad-ab'ra, <br/>i.  e.,  Ab'r,  the  Bull;  achad,  the  only,  &amp;c.&#x2014; Achad  is  one  of  the  names  of  the  Sun,  given  him  in <br/>consequence  of  his  Shining  ALONE,&#x2014; he  is  the  ONLY  Star  to  be  seen  when  he  is  seen&#x2014; the  remaining <br/>ab'ra,  makes  the  whole  to  be,  The  Bull,  the  only  Bull;  while  the  repetition  of  the  name  omitting  a  letter, <br/>till  all  is  gone,  is  the  most  simple,  yet  the  most  satisfactory  method  that  could  have  been  devised  to <br/>preserve  the  memory  of  the  fact;  and  the  name  of  Sorapis,  or  Serapis,  given  to  the  Bull  at  the  above <br/>ceremony  puts  it  beyond  all  doubt.  *  *  *  This  word  (Abracadabra)  disappears  in  eleven  decreasing <br/>stages;  as  in  the  figure.  And  what  is  very  remarkable,  a  body  with  three  heads  is  folded  up  by  a <br/>Serpent  with  eleven  Coils,  and  placed  by  Sorapis:  and  the  eleven  Volves  of  the  Serpent  form  a  triangle <br/>similar  to  that  formed  by  the  ELEVEN  diminishing  lines  of  the  abracadabra.&quot; <br/><br/>Nearly  every  religion  of  the  world  shows  traces  of  astrological  influence.  The  Old  Testament  of  the <br/>Jews,  its  writings  overshadowed  by  Egyptian  culture,  is  a  mass  of  astrological  and  astronomical <br/>allegories.  Nearly  all  the  mythology  of  Greece  and  Rome  maybe  traced  in  star  groups.  Some  writers <br/>are  of  the  opinion  that  the  original  twenty-two  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet  were  derived  from <br/>groups  of  stars,  and  that  the  starry  handwriting  on  the  wall  of  the  heavens  referred  to  words  spelt  out. <br/><br/><br/>with  fixed  stars  for  consonants,  and  the  planets,  or  luminaries,  for  vowels.  These,  coming  into  ever- <br/>different  combinations,  spelt  words  which,  when  properly  read,  foretold  future  events. <br/><br/>As  the  zodiacal  band  marks  the  pathway  of  the  sun  through  the  constellations,  it  results  in  the <br/>phenomena  of  the  seasons.  The  ancient  systems  of  measuring  the  year  were  based  upon  the <br/>equinoxes  and  the  solstices.  The  year  always  began  with  the  vernal  equinox,  celebrated  March  21  with <br/>rejoicing  to  mark  the  moment  when  the  sun  crossed  the  equator  northward  up  the  zodiacal  arc.  The <br/>summer  solstice  was  celebrated  when  the  sun  reached  its  most  northerly  position,  and  the  day <br/>appointed  was  June  21.  After  that  time  the  sun  began  to  descend  toward  the  equator,  which  it <br/>recrossed  southbound  at  the  autumnal  equinox,  September  21.  The  sun  reached  its  most  southerly <br/>position  at  the  winter  solstice,  December  21. <br/><br/>Four  of  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  have  been  permanently  dedicated  to  the  equinoxes  and  the  solstices; <br/>and,  while  the  signs  no  longer  correspond  with  the  ancient  constellations  to  which  they  were  assigned, <br/>and  from  which  they  secured  their  names,  they  are  accepted  by  modern  astronomers  as  a  basis  of <br/>calculation.  The  vernal  equinox  is  therefore  said  to  occur  in  the  constellation  of  Aries  (the  Ram).  It  is <br/>fitting  that  of  all  beasts  a  Ram  should  be  placed  at  the  head  of  the  heavenly  flock  forming  the  zodiacal <br/>band.  Centuries  before  the  Christian  Era,  the  pagans  revered  this  constellation.  Godfrey  Higgins <br/>states:  &quot;This  constellation  was  called  the  'Lamb  of  God.'  He  was  also  called  the  'Savior,'  and  was  said <br/>to  save  mankind  from  their  sins.  He  was  always  honored  with  the  appellation  of  'Dominus'  or  'Lord.' <br/>He  was  called  the  'Lamb  of  God  which  taketh  away  the  sins  of  the  world.'  The  devotees  addressing <br/>him  in  their  litany,  constantly  repeated  the  words,  'O  Lamb  of  God,  that  taketh  away  the  sin  of  the <br/>world,  have  mercy  upon  us.  Grant  us  Thy  peace.'&quot;  Therefore,  the  Lamb  of  God  is  a  title  given  to  the <br/>sun,  who  is  said  to  be  reborn  every  year  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  in  the  sign  of  the  Ram,  although, <br/>due  to  the  existing  discrepancy  between  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  and  the  actual  star  groups,  it  actually <br/>rises  in  the  sign  of  Pisces. <br/><br/>The  summer  solstice  is  regarded  as  occurring  in  Cancer  (the  Crab),  which  the  Egyptians  called  the <br/>scarab&#x2014; a  beetle  of  the  family  Lamellicornes,  the  head  of  the  insect  kingdom,  and  sacred  to  the <br/>Egyptians  as  the  symbol  of  Eternal  Life.  It  is  evident  that  the  constellation  of  the  Crab  is  represented <br/>by  this  peculiar  creature  because  the  sun,  after  passing  through  this  house,  proceeds  to  walk <br/>backwards,  or  descend  the  zodiacal  arc.  Cancer  is  the  symbol  of  generation,  for  it  is  the  house  of  the <br/>Moon,  the  great  Mother  of  all  things  and  the  patroness  of  the  life  forces  of  Nature.  Diana,  the  moon <br/>goddess  of  the  Greeks,  is  called  the  Mother  of  the  World.  Concerning  the  worship  of  the  feminine  or <br/>maternal  principle,  Richard  Payne  Knight  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;By  attracting  or  heaving  the  waters  of  the  ocean,  she  naturally  appeared  to  be  the  sovereign  of <br/>humidity;  and  by  seeming  to  operate  so  powerfully  upon  the  constitutions  of  women,  she  equally <br/>appeared  to  be  the  patroness  and  regulatress  of  nutrition  and  passive  generation:  whence  she  is  said <br/>to  have  received  her  nymphs,  or  subordinate  personifications,  from  the  ocean;  and  is  often <br/>represented  by  the  symbol  of  the  sea  crab,  an  animal  that  has  the  property  of  spontaneously <br/>detaching  from  its  own  body  any  limb  that  has  been  hurt  or  mutilated,  and  reproducing  another  in  its <br/>place.&quot;  (The  Symbolical  Language  of  Ancient  Art  and  Mythology .)  This  water  sign,  being  symbolic  of <br/>the  maternal  principle  of  Nature,  and  recognized  by  the  pagans  as  the  origin  of  all  life,  was  a  natural <br/>and  consistent  domicile  of  the  moon. <br/><br/>The  autumnal  equinox  apparently  occurs  in  the  constellation  of  Libra  (the  Balances).  The  scales <br/>tipped  and  the  solar  globe  began  its  pilgrimage  toward  the  house  of  winter.  The  constellation  of  the <br/>Scales  was  placed  in  the  zodiac  to  symbolize  the  power  of  choice,  by  means  of  which  man  may  weigh <br/>one  problem  against  another.  Millions  of  years  ago,  when  the  human  race  was  in  the  making,  man <br/>was  like  the  angels,  who  knew  neither  good  nor  evil.  He  fell  into  the  state  of  the  knowledge  of  good <br/>and  evil  when  the  gods  gave  him  the  seed  for  the  mental  nature.  From  man's  mental  reactions  to  his <br/>environments  he  distills  the  product  of  experience,  which  then  aids  him  to  regain  his  lost  position <br/><br/><br/>plus  an  individualized  intelligence.  Paracelsus  said:  &quot;The  body  comes  from  the  elements,  the  soul <br/>from  the  stars,  and  the  spirit  from  God.  All  that  the  intellect  can  conceive  of  comes  from  the  stars  [the <br/>spirits  of  the  stars,  rather  than  the  material  constellations].&quot; <br/><br/>The  constellation  of  Capricorn,  in  which  the  winter  solstice  theoretically  takes  place,  was  called  The <br/><br/>House  of  Death,  for  in  winter  all  life  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  is  at  its  lowest  ebb.  Capricorn  is  a <br/>composite  creature,  with  the  head  and  upper  body  of  a  goat  and  the  tail  of  a  fish.  In  this  constellation <br/>the  sun  is  least  powerful <br/><br/><br/>THE  MICROCOSM. <br/><br/>From  Schotus'  Margarita  Philosophica. <br/><br/>The  pagans  believed  that  the  zodiac  formed  the  body  of  the  Grand  Man  of  the  Universe.  This  body,  which  they  called  the <br/>Macrocosm  (the  Great  World),  was  divided  into  twelve  major  parts,  one  of  which  was  under  the  control  of  the  celestial <br/>powers  reposing  in  each  of  the  zodiacal  constellations.  Believing  that  the  entire  universal  system  was  epitomized  in  man's <br/>body,  which  they  called  the  Microcosm  (the  Little  World),  they  evolved  that  now  familiar  figure  of  &quot;the  cut-up  man  in  the <br/>almanac&quot;  by  allotting  a  sign  of  the  zodiac  to  each  of  twelve  major  parts  of  the  human  body. <br/><br/>P-  55 <br/><br/>in  the  Northern  Hemisphere,  and  after  passing  through  this  constellation  it  immediately  begins  to <br/>increase.  Hence  the  Greeks  said  that  Jupiter  (a  name  of  the  Sun  God)  was  suckled  by  a  goat.  A  new <br/>and  different  sidelight  on  zodiacal  symbolism  is  supplied  by  John  Cole,  in  A  Treatise  on  the  Circular <br/>Zodiac  ofTentyra,  in  Egypt:  &quot;The  symbol  therefore  of  the  Goat  rising  from  the  body  of  a  fish <br/>[Capricorn],  represents  with  the  greatest  propriety  the  mountainous  buildings  of  Babylon  rising  out <br/>of  its  low  and  marshy  situation;  the  two  horns  of  the  Goat  being  emblematical  of  the  two  towns, <br/>Nineveh  and  Babylon,  the  former  built  on  the  Tigris,  the  latter  on  the  Euphrates;  but  both  subjected <br/>to  one  sovereignty.&quot; <br/><br/>The  period  of  2,160  years  required  for  the  regression  of  the  sun  through  one  of  the  zodiacal <br/>constellations  is  often  termed  an  age.  According  to  this  system,  the  age  secured  its  name  from  the  sign <br/>through  which  the  sun  passes  year  after  year  as  it  crosses  the  equator  at  the  vernal  equinox.  From  this <br/>arrangement  are  derived  the  terms  The  Taurian  Age,  The  Aryan  Age,  The  Piscean  Age,  and  The <br/><br/><br/>Aquarian  Age.  During  these  periods,  or  ages,  religious  worship  takes  the  form  of  the  appropriate <br/><br/>celestial  sign&#x2014;that  which  the  sun  is  said  to  assume  as  a  personality  in  the  same  manner  that  a  spirit <br/>assumes  a  body.  These  twelve  signs  are  the  jewels  of  his  breastplate  and  his  light  shines  forth  from <br/>them,  one  after  the  other. <br/><br/>From  a  consideration  of  this  system,  it  is  readily  understood  why  certain  religious  symbols  were <br/>adopted  during  different  ages  of  the  earth's  history;  for  during  the  2,160  years  the  sun  was  in  the <br/>constellation  of  Taurus,  it  is  said  that  the  Solar  Deity  assumed  the  body  of  Apis,  and  the  Bull  became <br/>sacred  to  Osiris.  (For  details  concerning  the  astrological  ages  as  related  to  Biblical  symbolism,  see  The <br/>Message  of  the  Stars  by  Max  and  Augusta  Foss  Heindel.)  During  the  Aryan  Age  the  Lamb  was  held <br/>sacred  and  the  priests  were  called  shepherds.  Sheep  and  goats  were  sacrificed  upon  the  altars,  and  a <br/>scapegoat  was  appointed  to  bear  the  sins  of  Israel. <br/><br/>During  the  Age  of  Pisces,  the  Fish  was  the  symbol  of  divinity  and  the  Sun  God  fed  the  multitude  with <br/>two  small  fishes.  The  frontispiece  oilnmon's  Ancient  Faiths  shows  the  goddess  Isis  with  a  fish  on  her <br/>head;  and  the  Indian  Savior  God,  Christna,  in  one  of  his  incarnations  was  cast  from  the  mouth  of  a <br/>fish. <br/><br/>Not  only  is  Jesus  often  referred  to  as  the  Fisher  of  Men,  but  as  John  P.  Lundy  writes:  &quot;The  word  Fish <br/>is  an  abbreviation  of  this  whole  title,  Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  God,  Savior,  and  Cross;  or  as  St.  Augustine <br/>expresses  it,  'If  you  join  together  the  initial  letters  of  the  five  Greek  words,  Iriaoug  Xpioxo?  Qeov  Yioo <br/>Scoxfip,  which  mean  Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  God,  Savior,  they  will  make  1X0 YE,  Fish,  in  which  word <br/>Christ  is  mystically  understood,  because  He  was  able  to  live  in  the  abyss  of  this  mortality  as  in  the <br/>depth  of  waters,  that  is,  without  sin.'&quot;  (Monumental  Christianity.)  Many  Christians  observe  Friday, <br/>which  is  sacred  to  the  Virgin  (Venus),  upon  which  day  they  shall  eat  fish  and  not  meat.  The  sign  of  the <br/>fish  was  one  of  the  earliest  symbols  of  Christianity;  and  when  drawn  upon  the  sand,  it  informed  one <br/>Christian  that  another  of  the  same  faith  was  near. <br/><br/>Aquarius  is  called  the  Sign  of  the  Water  Bearer,  or  the  man  with  a  jug  of  water  on  his  shoulder <br/>mentioned  in  the  New  Testament.  This  is  sometimes  shown  as  an  angelic  figure,  supposedly <br/>androgynous,  either  pouring  water  from  an  urn  or  carrying  the  vessel  upon  its  shoulder.  Among <br/>Oriental  peoples,  a  water  vessel  alone  is  often  used.  Edward  Upham,  in  his  History  and  Doctrine  of <br/>Budhism,  describes  Aquarius  as  being  &quot;in  the  shape  of  a  pot  and  of  a  color  between  blue  and  yellow; <br/>this  Sign  is  the  single  house  of  Saturn.&quot; <br/><br/>When  Herschel  discovered  the  planet  Uranus  (sometimes  called  by  the  name  of  its  discoverer),  the <br/>second  half  of  the  sign  of  Aquarius  was  allotted  to  this  added  member  of  the  planetary  family.  The <br/>water  pouring  from  the  urn  of  Aquarius  under  the  name  of  &quot;the  waters  of  eternal  life&quot;  appears  many <br/>times  in  symbolism.  So  it  is  with  all  the  signs.  Thus  the  sun  in  its  path  controls  whatever  form  of <br/>worship  man  offers  to  the  Supreme  Deity. <br/><br/>There  are  two  distinct  systems  of  astrological  philosophy.  One  of  them,  the  Ptolemaic,  is  geocentric: <br/>the  earth  is  considered  the  center  of  the  solar  system,  around  which  the  sun,  moon,  and  planets <br/>revolve.  Astronomically,  the  geocentric  system  is  incorrect;  but  for  thousands  of  years  it  has  proved <br/>its  accuracy  when  applied  to  the  material  nature  of  earthly  things.  A  careful  consideration  of  the <br/>writings  of  the  great  occultists  and  a  study  of  their  diagrams  reveal  the  fact  that  many  of  them  were <br/>acquainted  with  another  method  of  arranging  the  heavenly  bodies. <br/><br/>The  other  system  of  astrological  philosophy  is  called  the  heliocentric.  This  posits  the  sun  in  the  center <br/>of  the  solar  system,  where  it  naturally  belongs,  with  the  planets  and  their  moons  revolving  about  it. <br/>The  great  difficulty,  however,  with  the  heliocentric  system  is  that,  being  comparatively  new,  there  has <br/>not  been  sufficient  time  to  experiment  successfully  and  catalogue  the  effects  of  its  various  aspects  and <br/><br/><br/>relationships.  Geocentric  astrology,  as  its  name  implies,  is  confined  to  the  earthy  side  of  nature,  while <br/>heliocentric  astrology  maybe  used  to  analyze  the  higher  intellectual  and  spiritual  faculties  of  man. <br/><br/>The  important  point  to  be  remembered  is  that  when  the  sun  was  said  to  be  in  a  certain  sign  of  the <br/>zodiac,  the  ancients  really  meant  that  the  sun  occupied  the  opposite  sign  and  cast  its  long  ray  into  the <br/>house  in  which  they  enthroned  it.  Therefore,  when  it  is  said  that  the  sun  is  in  Taurus,  it  means <br/>(astronomically)  that  the  sun  is  in  the  sign  opposite  to  Taurus,  which  is  Scorpio.  This  resulted  in  two <br/>distinct  schools  of  philosophy:  one  geocentric  and  exoteric,  the  other  heliocentric  and  esoteric.  While <br/>the  ignorant  multitudes  worshiped  the  house  of  the  sun's  reflection,  which  in  the  case  described <br/>would  be  the  Bull,  the  wise  revered  the  house  of  the  sun's  actual  dwelling,  which  would  be  the <br/>Scorpion,  or  the  Serpent,  the  symbol  of  the  concealed  spiritual  mystery.  This  sign  has  three  different <br/>symbols.  The  most  common  is  that  of  a  Scorpion,  who  was  called  by  the  ancients  the  backbiter,  being <br/>the  symbol  of  deceit  and  perversion;  the  second  (and  less  common)  form  of  the  sign  is  a  Serpent, <br/>often  used  by  the  ancients  to  symbolize  wisdom. <br/><br/>Probably  the  rarest  form  of  Scorpio  is  that  of  an  Eagle.  The  arrangement  of  the  stars  of  the <br/>constellation  bears  as  much  resemblance  to  a  flying  bird  as  to  a  scorpion.  Scorpio,  being  the  sign  of <br/>occult  initiation,  the  flying  eagle&#x2014;the  king  of  birds&#x2014;represents  the  highest  and  most  spiritual  type  of <br/>Scorpio,  in  which  it  transcends  the  venomous  insect  of  the  earth.  As  Scorpio  and  Taurus  are  opposite <br/>each  other  in  the  zodiac,  their  symbolism  is  often  closely  intermingled.  The  Hon.  E.  M.  Plunket,  in <br/>Ancient  Calendars  and  Constellations,  says:  &quot;The  Scorpion  (the  constellation  Scorpio  of  the  Zodiac <br/>opposed  to  Taurus)  joins  with  Mithras  in  his  attack  upon  the  Bull,  and  always  the  genii  of  the  spring <br/>and  autumn  equinoxes  are  present  in  joyous  and  mournful  attitudes.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Egyptians,  the  Assyrians,  and  the  Babylonians,  who  knew  the  sun  as  a  Bull,  called  the  zodiac  a <br/>series  of  furrows,  through  which  the  great  celestial  Ox  dragged  the  plow  of  the  sun.  Hence  the <br/>populace  offered  up  sacrifice  and  led  through  the  streets  magnificent  steers,  bedecked  with  flowers <br/>and  surrounded  with  priests,  dancing  girls  of  the  temple,  and  musicians.  The  philosophic  elect  did  not <br/>participate  in  these  idolatrous  ceremonials,  but  advocated  them  as  most  suitable  for  the  types  of  mind <br/>composing  the  mass  of  the  population.  These  few  possessed  a  far  deeper  understanding,  as  the <br/>Serpent  of  Scorpio  upon  their  foreheads&#x2014;the  [7r&#x00a3;Bus&#x2014; bore  witness. <br/><br/>The  sun  is  often  symbolized  with  its  rays  in  the  form  of  a  shaggy  mane.  Concerning  the  Masonic <br/>significance  of  Leo,  Robert  Hewitt  Brown,  32&#x00b0;,  has  written:  &quot;On  the  21st  of  June,  when  the  sun  arrives <br/>at  the  summer  solstice,  the  constellation  Leo&#x2014; being  but  30&#x00b0;  in  advance  of  the  sun&#x2014; appears  to  be <br/>leading  the  way,  and  to  aid  by  his  powerful  paw  in  lifting  the  sun  up  to  the  summit  of  the  zodiacal <br/>arch.  *  *  *  This  visible  connection  between  the  constellation  Leo  and  the  return  of  the  sun  to  his  place <br/>of  power  and  glory,  at  the  summit  of  the  Royal  Arch  of  heaven,  was  the  principal  reason  why  that <br/>constellation  was  held  in  such  high  esteem  and  reverence  by  the  ancients.  The  astrologers <br/>distinguished  Leo  as  the  'sole  house  of  the  sun,'  and  taught  that  the  world  was  created  when  the  sun <br/>was  in  that  sign.  'The  lion  was  adored  in  the  East  and  the  West  by  the  Egyptians  and  the  Mexicans. <br/>The  chief  Druid  of  Britain  was  styled  a  lion.'&quot;  (Stellar  Theology  and  Masonic  Astronomy.)  When  the <br/>Aquarian  Age  is  thoroughly  established,  the  sun  will  be  in  Leo,  as  will  be  noted  from  the  explanation <br/>previously  given  in  this  chapter  regarding  the  distinction  between  geocentric  and  heliocentric <br/>astrology.  Then,  indeed,  will  the  secret  religions  of  the  world  include  once  more  the  raising  to <br/>initiation  by  the  Grip  of  the  Lion's  Paw.  (Lazarus  will  come  forth.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  CIRCULAR  ZODIAC  OF  TENTYRA. <br/><br/><br/>From  Cole's  Treatise&#x2014; the  Circular  Zodiac  ofTentyra,  in  Egypt. <br/><br/>The  oldest  circular  zodiac  known  is  the  one  found  at  Tentyra,  in  Egypt,  and  now  in  the  possession  of  the  French <br/>government.  Mr.  John  Cole  describes  this  remarkable  zodiac  as  follows:  &quot;The  diameter  of  the  medallion  in  which  the <br/>constellations  are  sculptured,  is  four  feet  nine  inches,  French  measure.  It  is  surrounded  by  another  circle  of  much  larger <br/>circumference,  containing  hieroglyphic  characters;  this  second  circle  is  enclosed  in  a  square,  whose  sides  are  seven  feet <br/>nine  inches  long.  *  *  *  The  asterisms,  constituting  the  Zodiacal  constellations  mixed  with  others,  are  represented  in  a <br/>spiral.  The  extremities  of  this  spiral,  after  one  revolution,  are  Leo  and  Cancer.  Leo  is  no  doubt  at  the  head.  It  appears  to  be <br/>trampling  on  a  serpent,  and  its  tail  to  be  held  by  a  woman.  Immediately  after  the  Lion  comes  the  Virgin  holding  an  ear  of <br/>corn.  Further  on,  we  perceive  two  scales  of  a  balance,  above  which,  in  a  medal  lion,  is  the  figure  of  Harpocrates.  Then <br/>follows  the  Scorpion  and  Sagittarius,  to  whom  the  Egyptians  gave  wings,  and  two  faces.  After  Sagittarius  are  successively <br/>placed,  Capricornus,  Aquarius,  Pisces,  the  Ram,  the  Bull,  and  the  Twins.  This  Zodiacal  procession  is,  as  we  have  already <br/>observed,  terminated  by  Cancer,  the  Crab.&quot; <br/><br/>p-  56 <br/><br/>The  antiquity  of  the  zodiac  is  much  in  dispute.  To  contend  that  it  originated  but  a  mere  few  thousand <br/>years  before  the  Christian  Era  is  a  colossal  mistake  on  the  part  of  those  who  have  sought  to  compile <br/>data,  concerning  its  origin.  The  zodiac  necessarily  must  be  ancient  enough  to  go  backward  to  that <br/>period  when  its  signs  and  symbols  coincided  exactly  with  the  positions  of  the  constellations  whose <br/>various  creatures  in  their  natural  functions  exemplified  the  outstanding  features  of  the  sun's  activity <br/>during  each  of  the  twelve  months.  One  author,  after  many  years  of  deep  study  on  the  subject,  believed <br/>man's  concept  of  the  zodiac  to  be  at  least  five  million  years  old.  In  all  probability  it  is  one  of  the  many <br/>things  for  which  the  modem  world  is  indebted  to  the  Atlantean  or  the  Lemurian  civilizations.  About <br/>ten  thousand  years  before  the  Christian  Era  there  was  a  period  of  many  ages  when  knowledge  of  every <br/>kind  was  suppressed,  tablets  destroyed,  monuments  torn  down,  and  every  vestige  of  available <br/>material  concerning  previous  civilizations  completely  obliterated.  Only  a  few  copper  knives,  some <br/>arrowheads,  and  crude  carvings  on  the  walls  of  caves  bear  mute  witness  of  those  civilizations  which <br/>preceded  this  age  of  destruction.  Here  and  there  a  few  gigantic  structures  have  remained  which,  like <br/>the  strange  monoliths  on  Easter  Island,  are  evidence  of  lost  arts  and  sciences  and  lost  races.  The <br/>human  race  is  exceedingly  old.  Modern  science  counts  its  age  in  tens  of  thousands  of  years;  occultism, <br/>in  tens  of  millions.  There  is  an  old  saying  that  &quot;Mother  Earth  has  shaken  many  civilizations  from  her <br/><br/><br/>back,&quot;  and  it  is  not  beyond  reason  that  the  principles  of  astrology  and  astronomy  were  evolved <br/>millions  of  years  before  the  first  white  man  appeared. <br/><br/>The  occultists  of  the  ancient  world  had  a  most  remarkable  understanding  of  the  principle  of  evolution. <br/>They  recognized  all  life  as  being  in  various  stages  of  becoming.  They  believed  that  grains  of  sand  were <br/>in  the  process  of  becoming  human  in  consciousness  but  not  necessarily  in  form;  that  human <br/>creatures  were  in  the  process  of  becoming  planets;  that  planets  were  in  the  process  of  becoming  solar <br/>systems;  and  that  solar  systems  were  in  the  process  of  becoming  cosmic  chains;  and  so  on  ad <br/>infinitum.  One  of  the  stages  between  the  solar  system  and  the  cosmic  chain  was  called  the  zodiac; <br/>therefore  they  taught  that  at  a  certain  time  a  solar  system  breaks  up  into  a  zodiac.  The  house  of  the <br/>zodiac  become  the  thrones  for  twelve  Celestial  Hierarchies,  or  as  certain  of  the  ancients  state,  ten <br/>Divine  Orders.  Pythagoras  taught  that  lo,  or  the  unit  of  the  decimal  system,  was  the  most  perfect  of <br/>all  numbers,  and  he  symbolized  the  number  ten  by  the  lesser  tetractys,  an  arrangement  of  ten  dots  in <br/>the  form  of  an  upright  triangle. <br/><br/>The  early  star  gazers,  after  dividing  the  zodiac  into  its  houses,  appointed  the  three  brightest  scars  in <br/>each  constellation  to  be  the  joint  rulers  of  that  house.  Then  they  divided  the  house  into  three  sections <br/>of  ten  degrees  each,  which  they  called  decans.  These,  in  turn,  were  divided  in  half,  resulting  in  the <br/>breaking  up  of  the  zodiac  into  seventy-two  duodecans  of  five  degrees  each.  Over  each  of  these <br/>duodecans  the  Hebrews  placed  a  celestial  intelligence,  or  angel,  and  from  this  system,  has  resulted <br/>the  Qabbalistic  arrangement  of  the  seventy-two  sacred  names,  which  correspond  to  the  seventy-two <br/>flowers,  knops,  and  almonds  upon  the  seven-branched  Candlestick  of  the  Tabernacle,  and  the <br/>seventy-two  men  who  were  chosen  from  the  Twelve  Tribes  to  represent  Israel. <br/><br/>The  only  two  signs  not  already  mentioned  are  Gemini  and  Sagittarius.  The  constellation  of  Gemini  is <br/>generally  represented  as  two  small  children,  who,  according  to  the  ancients,  were  born  out  of  eggs, <br/>possibly  the  ones  that  the  Bull  broke  with  his  horns.  The  stories  concerning  Castor  and  Pollux,  and <br/>Romulus  and  Remus,  may  be  the  result  of  amplifying  the  myths  of  these  celestial  Twins.  The  symbols <br/>of  Gemini  have  passed  through  many  modifications.  The  one  used  by  the  Arabians  was  the  peacock. <br/>Two  of  the  important  stars  in  the  constellation  of  Gemini  still  bear  the  names  of  Castor  and  Pollux. <br/>The  sign  of  Gemini  is  supposed  to  have  been  the  patron  of  phallic  worship,  and  the  two  obelisks,  or <br/>pillars,  in  front  of  temples  and  churches  convey  the  same  symbolism  as  the  Twins. <br/><br/>The  sign  of  Sagittarius  consists  of  what  the  ancient  Greeks  called  a  centaur~a  composite  creature,  the <br/>lower  half  of  whose  body  was  in  the  form  of  a  horse,  while  the  upper  half  was  human.  The  centaur  is <br/>generally  shown  with  a  bow  and  arrow  in  his  hands,  aiming  a  shaft  far  off  into  the  stars.  Hence <br/>Sagittarius  stands  for  two  distinct  principles:  first,  it  represents  the  spiritual  evolution  of  man,  for  the <br/>human  form  is  rising  from  the  body  of  the  beast;  secondly,  it  is  the  symbol  of  aspiration  and  ambition, <br/>for  as  the  centaur  aims  his  arrow  at  the  stars,  so  every  human  creature  aims  at  a  higher  mark  than  he <br/>can  reach. <br/><br/>Albert  Churchward,  in  The  Signs  and  Symbols  of  Primordial  Man,  sums  up  the  influence  of  the <br/>zodiac  upon  religious  symbolism  in  the  following  words:  &quot;The  division  here  [is]  in  twelve  parts,  the <br/>twelve  signs  of  the  Zodiac,  twelve  tribes  of  Israel,  twelve  gates  of  heaven  mentioned  in  Revelation, <br/>and  twelve  entrances  or  portals  to  be  passed  through  in  the  Great  Pyramid,  before  finally  reaching  the <br/>highest  degree,  and  twelve  Apostles  in  the  Christian  doctrines,  and  the  twelve  original  and  perfect <br/>points  in  Masonry.&quot; <br/><br/>The  ancients  believed  that  the  theory  of  man's  being  made  in  the  image  of  God  was  to  be  understood <br/>literally.  They  maintained  that  the  universe  was  a  great  organism  not  unlike  the  human  body,  and <br/>that  every  phase  and  function  of  the  Universal  Body  had  a  correspondence  in  man.  The  most  precious <br/>Key  to  Wisdom  that  the  priests  communicated  to  the  new  initiates  was  what  they  termed  the  law  of <br/><br/><br/>analogy.  Therefore,  to  the  ancients,  the  study  of  the  stars  was  a  sacred  science,  for  they  saw  in  the <br/>movements  of  the  celestial  bodies  the  ever-present  activity  of  the  Infinite  Father. <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  were  often  undeservedly  criticized  for  promulgating  the  so-called  doctrine  of <br/>metempsychosis,  or  the  transmigration  of  souls.  This  concept  as  circulated  among  the  uninitiated  was <br/>merely  a  blind,  however,  to  conceal  a  sacred  truth.  Greek  mystics  believed  that  the  spiritual  nature  of <br/>man  descended  into  material  existence  from  the  Milky  Way&#x2014; the  seed  ground  of  souls&#x2014;through  one  of <br/>the  twelve  gates  of  the  great  zodiacal  band.  The  spiritual  nature  was  therefore  said  to  incarnate  in  the <br/>form  of  the  symbolic  creature  created  by  Magian  star  gazers  to  represent  the  various  zodiacal <br/>constellations.  If  the  spirit  incarnated  through  the  sign  of  Aries,  it  was  said  to  be  born  in  the  body  of  a <br/>ram;  if  in  Taurus,  in  the  body  of  the  celestial  bull.  All  human  beings  were  thus  symbolized  by  twelve <br/>mysterious  creatures  through  the  natures  of  which  they  were  able  to  incarnate  into  the  material  world. <br/>The  theory  of  transmigration  was  not  applicable  to  the  visible  material  body  of  man,  but  rather  to  the <br/>invisible  immaterial  spirit  wandering  along  the  pathway  of  the  stars  and  sequentially  assuming  in  the <br/>course  of  evolution  the  forms  of  the  sacred  zodiacal  animals. <br/><br/>In  the  Third  Book  of  the  Mathesis  of  Julius  Firmicus  Maternus  appears  the  following  extract <br/>concerning  the  positions  of  the  heavenly  bodies  at  the  time  of  the  establishment  of  the  inferior <br/>universe:  &quot;According  to  ^Esculapius,  therefore,  and  Anubius,  to  whom  especially  the  divinity  Mercury <br/>committed  the  secrets  of  the  astrological  science,  the  geniture  of  the  world  is  as  follows:  They <br/>constituted  the  Sun  in  the  15th  part  of  Leo,  the  Moon  in  the  15th  part  of  Cancer,  Saturn  in  the  15th <br/>part  of  Capricorn,  Jupiter  in  the  15th  part  of  Sagittary,  Mars  in  the  15th  part  of  Scorpio,  Venus  in  the <br/>15th  part  of  Libra,  Mercury  in  the  15th  part  of  Virgo,  and  the  Horoscope  in  the  15th  part  of  Cancer. <br/>Conformably  to  this  geniture,  therefore,  to  these  conditions  of  the  stars,  and  the  testimonies  which <br/>they  adduce  in  confirmation  of  this  geniture,  they  are  of  opinion  that  the  destinies  of  men,  also,  are <br/>disposed  in  accordance  with  the  above  arrangement,  as  maybe  learnt  from  that  book  of  ^Esculapius <br/>which  is  called  Mupioysveoig,  (i.e.  Ten  Thousand,  or  an  innumerable  multitude  of  Genitures)  in  order <br/>that  nothing  in  the  several  genitures  of  men  may  be  found  to  be  discordant  with  the  above-mentioned <br/>geniture  of  the  world.&quot;  The  seven  ages  of  man  are  under  the  control  of  the  planets  in  the  following <br/>order:  infancy,  the  moon;  childhood.  Mercury;  adolescence,  Venus;  maturity,  the  sun;  middle  age. <br/>Mars;  advanced  age,  Jupiter;  and  decrepitude  and  dissolution,  Saturn. <br/><br/><br/>HIEROGLYPHIC  PLAN,  By  HERMES,  OF  THE  ANCIENT  ZODIAC. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  CEdipus  j^gyptiacus. <br/><br/>The  inner  circle  contains  the  hieroglyph  of  Hemphta,  the  triform  and  pantamorphic  deity.

CVBt^NATORL  NLCUOU  M&#x00ab;NO  TCVTONICI  GRU ,  .WAG Is TRQ. <br/><br/><br/>THE  BEMBINE  TABLE  OF  ISIS. <br/><br/><br/>Concerning  the  theurgic  or  magic  sense  in  which  the  Egyptian  priests  exhibited  in  the  Bembine  Table  of  Isis  the  philosophy  of  sacrifice,  rites,  and  ceremonies <br/><br/>system  of  occult  symbols,  Athanasius  Kircher  writes: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;The  early  priests  believed  that  a  great  spiritual  power  was  invoked  by  correct  and  unabridged  sacrificial  ceremonies.  If <br/>one  feature  were  lacking,  the  whole  was  vitiated,  says  lamblichus.  Hence  they  were  most  careful  in  all  details,  for  they <br/>considered  it  absolutely  essential  for  the  entire  chain  of  logical  connections  to  be  exactly  according  to  ritual.  Certainly  for <br/>no  other  reason  did  they  prepare  and  prescribe  for  future  use  the  manuals,  as  it  were,  for  conducting  the  rites.  They <br/>learned,  too,  what  the  first  hieromancers&#x2014;possessed,  as  it  were,  by  a  divine  fury&#x2014;devised  as  a  system  of  symbolism  for <br/>exhibiting  their  mysteries.  These  they  placed  in  this  Tablet  of  Isis,  before  the  eyes  of  those  admitted  to  the  sanctum <br/>sanctorum  in  order  to  teach  the  nature  of  the  Gods  and  the  prescribed  forms  of  sacrifice.  Since  each  of  the  orders  of  Gods <br/>had  its  own  peculiar  symbols,  gestures,  costumes,  and  ornaments,  they  thought  it  necessary  to  observe  these  in  the  whole <br/>apparatus  of  worship,  as  nothing  was  more  efficacious  in  drawing  the  benign  attention  of  the  deities  and  genii.  *  *  *  Thus <br/>their  temples,  remote  from  the  usual  haunts  of  men,  contained  representations  of  nearly  every  form  in  nature.  First,  in  the <br/>pavement,  they  symbolized  the  physical  economy  of  the  world,  using  minerals,  stones  and  other  things  suitable  for <br/>ornaments,  including  little  streams  of  water.  The  walls  showed  the  starry  world,  and  the  done  the  world  of  genii.  In  the <br/>center  was  the  altar,  to  suggest  the  emanations  of  the  Supreme  Mind  from  its  center.  Thus  the  entire  interior  constituted  a <br/>picture  of  the  Universe  of  Worlds.  The  priests  in  making  sacrifices  wore  raiment  adorned  with  figures  similar  to  those <br/>attributed  to  the  Gods.  Their  bodies  were  partially  bare  like  those  of  the  deities,  and  they  themselves  were  divested  of  all <br/>material  cares  and  practices  the  strictest  chastity.  *  *  *  Their  heads  were  veiled  to  indicate  their  charge  of  earthly  things. <br/>Their  heads  and  bodies  were  shaved,  for  they  regarded  hair  as  a  useless  excrescence.  Upon  the  head  they  bore  the  same <br/>insignia  as  those  attributed  to  the  Gods.  Thus  arrayed,  they  regarded  themselves  to  be  transformed  into  that  intelligence <br/>with  which  they  constantly  desired  to  be  identified.  For  example,  in  order  to  call  down  to  the  world  the  soul  and  spirit  of <br/>the  Universe,  they  stood  before  the  image  shown  in  the  center  of  our  Tablet,  wearing  the  same  symbols  as  that  figure  and <br/>its  attendants,  and  offered  sacrifices.  By  these  and  the  accompanying  singing  of  hymns  they  believed  that  they  infallibly <br/>drew  the  God's  attention  to  their  prayer.  And  so  they  did  in  regard  to  other  regions  of  the  Tablet,  believing  of  necessity  the <br/>proper  ritual  properly  carried  out  would  evoke  the  deity  desired.  That  this  was  the  origin  of  the  science  of  oracles  is <br/>apparent.  As  a  touched  chord  produces  a  harmony  of  sound,  likewise  the  adjoining  chords  respond  though  not  touched. <br/>Similarly  the  idea  they  expressed  by  their  concurrent  acts  while  adoring  the  God  came  into  accord  with  basic  Idea  and,  by <br/>an  intellectual  union,  it  was  returned  to  them  deiformed,  and  they  thus  obtained  the  Idea  of  Ideas.  Hence  there  sprang  up <br/>in  their  souls,  they  thought,  the  gift  of  prophecy  and  divination,  and  they  believed  they  could  foretell  future  events, <br/>impending  evils,  etc.  For  as  in  the  Supreme  Mind  everj^hing  is  simultaneous  and  spaceless,  the  future  is  therefore  present <br/>in  that  Mind;  and  they  thought  that  while  the  human  mind  was  absorbed  in  the  Supreme  by  contemplation,  by  that  union <br/>they  were  enabled  to  know  all  the  future.  Nearly  all  that  is  represented  in  our  Tablet  consists  of  amulets  which,  by  analogy <br/>above  described,  would  inspire  them,  under  the  described  conditions,  with  the  virtues  of  the  Supreme  Power  and  enable <br/>them  to  receive  good  and  avert  evil.  They  also  believed  they  could  in  this  magical  manner  effect  cures  of  diseases;  that <br/>genii  could  be  induced  to  appear  to  them  during  sleep  and  cure  or  teach  them  to  cure  the  sick.  In  this  belief  they  consulted <br/>the  Gods  about  all  sort  of  doubts  and  difficulties,  while  adorned  with  the  simulacra  of  the  mystic  rite  and  intently <br/>contemplating  the  Divine  Ideas;  and  while  so  enraptured  they  believed  the  God  by  some  sign,  nod  or  gesture <br/>communicated  with  them,  whether  asleep  or  awake,  concerning  the  truth  or  falsity  of  the  matter  in  point.&quot;  (See  CEdipus <br/>jEgyptiaciis.) <br/><br/><br/>The  Bembine  Table  of  Isis <br/><br/><br/>A  MANUSCRIPT  by  Thomas  Taylor  contains  the  following  remarkable  paragraph: <br/><br/>&quot;Plato  was  initiated  into  the  'Greater  Mysteries'  at  the  age  of  49.  The  initiation  took  place  in  one  of  the <br/>subterranean  halls  of  the  Great  Pyramid  in  Egypt.  The  ISIAC  TABLE  formed  the  altar,  before  which <br/>the  Divine  Plato  stood  and  received  that  which  was  always  his,  but  which  the  ceremony  of  the <br/>Mysteries  enkindled  and  brought  from  its  dormant  state.  With  this  ascent,  after  three  days  in  the <br/>Great  Hall,  he  was  received  by  the  Hierophant  of  the  Pyramid  (the  Hierophant  was  seen  only  by  those <br/>who  had  passed  the  three  days,  the  three  degrees,  the  three  dimensions)  and  given  verbally  the <br/>Highest  Esoteric  Teachings,  each  accompanied  with  Its  appropriate  Symbol.  After  a  further  three <br/>months'  sojourn  in  the  halls  of  the  Pyramid,  the  Initiate  Plato  was  sent  out  into  the  world  to  do  the <br/>work  of  the  Great  Order,  as  Pj^hagoras  and  Orpheus  had  been  before  him.&quot; <br/><br/>Before  the  sacking  of  Rome  in  1527  there  is  no  historical  mention  of  the  Mensa  Isiaca,  (Tablet  of  Isis). <br/>At  that  time  the  Tablet  came  into  the  possession  of  a  certain  locksmith  or  ironworker,  who  sold  it  at <br/>an  exorbitant  price  to  Cardinal  Bembo,  a  celebrated  antiquary,  historiographer  of  the  Republic  of <br/>Venice,  and  afterwards  librarian  of  St.  Mark's.  After  his  death  in  1547  the  Isiac  Tablet  was  acquired  by <br/>the  House  of  Mantua,  in  whose  museum  it  remained  until  1630,  when  troops  of  Ferdinand  II <br/>captured  the  city  of  Mantua.  Several  early  writers  on  the  subject  have  assumed  that  the  Tablet  was <br/>demolished  by  the  ignorant  soldiery  for  the  silver  it  contained.  The  assumption,  however,  was <br/>erroneous.  The  Tablet  fell  into  the  hands  of  Cardinal  Pava,  who  presented  it  to  the  Duke  of  Savoy, <br/>who  in  turn  presented  it  to  the  King  of  Sardinia.  When  the  French  conquered  Italy  in  1797  the  Tablet <br/>was  carried  to  Paris.  In  1809,  Alexandre  Lenoir,  writing  of  the  Mensa  Isiaca,  said  it  was  on  exhibition <br/>at  the  Bibliotheque  Nationale.  Upon  the  establishment  of  peace  between  the  two  countries  it  was <br/>returned  to  Italy.  In  his  Guide  to  Northern  Italy,  Karl  Baedeker  describes  the  Mensa  Isiaca  as  being <br/>in  the  center  of  Gallery  2  in  the  Museum  of  Antiquities  at  Turin. <br/><br/>A  faithful  reproduction  of  the  original  Tablet  was  made  in  1559  by  the  celebrated  JEneas  Vicus  of <br/>Parma,  and  a  copy  of  the  engraving  was  given  by  the  Chancellor  of  the  Duke  of  Bavaria  to  the <br/>Museum  of  Hieroglyphics.  Athanasius  Kircher  describes  the  Tablet  as  &quot;five  palms  long  and  four <br/>wide.&quot;  W.  Wynn  Westcott  says  it  measures  50  by  30  inches.  It  was  made  of  bronze  and  decorated  with <br/>encaustic  or  smalt  enamel  and  silver  inlay.  Fosbroke  adds:  &quot;The  figures  are  cut  very  shallow,  and  the <br/>contour  of  most  of  them  is  encircled  by  threads  of  silver.  The  bases  upon  which  the  figures  were <br/>seated  or  reclined,  and  left  blank  in  the  prints,  were  of  silver  and  are  torn  away.&quot;  (See  Encyclopaedia <br/>of  Antiquities.) <br/><br/>Those  familiar  with  the  fundamental  principles  of  Hermetic  philosophy  will  recognize  in  the  Mensa <br/>Isiaca  the  key  to  Chaldean,  Egyptian,  and  Greek  theology.  In  his  Antiquities,  the  learned  Benedictine, <br/>Father  Montfaucon,  admits  his  inability  to  cope  with  the  intricacies  of  its  symbolism.  He  therefore <br/>doubts  that  the  emblems  upon  the  Tablet  possess  any  significance  worthy  of  consideration  and <br/>ridicules  Kircher,  declaring  him  to  be  more  obscure  than  the  Tablet  itself.  Laurentius  Pignorius <br/>reproduced  the  Tablet  in  connection  with  a  descriptive  essay  in  1605,  but  his  timidly  advanced <br/>explanations  demonstrated  his  ignorance  concerning  the  actual  interpretation  of  the  figures. <br/><br/>In  his  CEdipus Mgyptiacus,  published  in  1654,  Kircher  attacked  the  problem  with  characteristic <br/>avidity.  Being  peculiarly  qualified  for  such  a  task  by  years  of  research  in  matters  pertaining  to  the <br/>secret  doctrines  of  antiquity,  and  with  the  assistance  of  a  group  of  eminent  scholars,  Kircher <br/>accomplished  much  towards  an  exposition  of  the  mysteries  of  the  Tablet.  The  master  secret,  however, <br/>eluded  even  him,  as  Eliphas  Levi  has  shrewdly  noted  in  his  History  of  Magic. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;The  learned  Jesuit,  &quot;  writes  Levi,  &quot;divined  that  it  contained  the  hieroglyphic  key  to  sacred  alphabets, <br/>though  he  was  unable  to  develop  the  explanation.  It  is  divided  into  three  equal  compartments;  above <br/>are  the  twelve  houses  of  heaven  and  below  are  the  corresponding  distributions  of  labor  [work  periods] <br/>throughout  the  year,  while  in  the  middle  place  are  twenty-one  sacred  signs  answering  to  the  letters  of <br/>the  alphabet.  In  the  midst  of  all  is  a  seated  figure  of  the  pantomorphic  lYNX,  emblem  of  universal <br/>being  and  corresponding  as  such  to  the  Hebrew  Yod,  or  to  that  unique  letter  from  which  all  the  other <br/>letters  were  formed.  The  lYNX  is  encircled  by  the  Ophite  triad,  answering  to  the  Three  Mother  Letters <br/>of  the  Egyptian  and  Hebrew  alphabets.  On  the  right  are  the  Ibimorphic  and  Serapian  triads;  on  the <br/>left  are  those  of  Nepthys  and  Hecate,  representing  active  and  passive,  fixed  and  volatile,  fructifying <br/>fire  and  generating  water.  Each  pair  of  triads  in  conjunction  with  the  center  produces  a  septenary, <br/>and  a  septenary  is  contained  in  the  center.  The  three  septenaries  furnish  the  absolute  number  of  the <br/>three  worlds,  as  well  as  the  complete  number  of  primitive  letters,  to  which  a  complementary  sign  is <br/>added,  like  zero  to  the  nine  numerals.&quot; <br/><br/>Levi's  hint  may  be  construed  to  mean  that  the  twenty-one  figures  in  the  center  section  of  the  Table <br/>represent  the  twenty-one  major  trumps  of  the  Tarot  cards.  If  this  be  so,  is  not  the  zero  card,  cause  of <br/>so  much  controversy,  the  nameless  crown  of  the  Supreme  Mind,  the  crown  being  symbolized  by  the <br/>hidden  triad  in  the  upper  part  of  the  throne  in  the  center  of  the  Table?  Might  not  the  first  emanation <br/>of  this  Supreme  Mind  be  well  symbolized  by  a  juggler  or  magician  with  the  symbols  of  the  four  lower <br/>worlds  spread  out  on  a  table  before  him:  the  rod,  the  sword,  the  cup,  and  the  coin?  Thus  considered, <br/>the  zero  card  belongs  nowhere  among  the  others  but  is  in  fact  the  fourth  dimensional  point  from <br/>which  they  all  emanated  and  consequently  is  broken  up  into  the  twenty-one  cards  (letters)  which, <br/>when  gathered  together,  produce  the  zero.  The  cipher  appearing  upon  this  card  would  substantiate <br/>this  interpretation,  for  the  cipher,  or  circle,  is  emblematic  of  the  superior  sphere  from  which  issue  the <br/>lower  worlds,  powers,  and  letters. <br/><br/>Westcott  carefully  collected  the  all  too  meager  theories  advanced  by  various  authorities  and  in  1887 <br/>published  his  now  extremely  rare  volume,  which  contains  the  only  detailed  description  of  the  Isiac <br/>Tablet  published  in  English  since  Humphreys  translated  Montfaucon's  worthless  description  in  1721. <br/>After  explaining  his  reticence  to  reveal  that  which  Levi  evidently  felt  was  better  left  concealed, <br/>Westcott  sums  up  his  interpretation  of  the  Tablet  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;The  diagram  of  Levi,  by  which  he  explains  the  mystery  of  the  Tablet,  shows  the  Upper  Region <br/>divided  into  the  four  seasons  of  the  year,  each  with  three  signs  of  the  Zodiac,  and  he  has  added  the <br/>four-lettered  sacred  name,  the  Tetragrammaton,  assigning  Jod  to  Aquarius,  that  is  Canopus,  He  to <br/>Taurus,  that  is  Apis,  Vau  to  Leo,  that  is  Momphta,  and  He  final  to  Typhon.  Note  the  Cherubic  parallel- <br/>-Man,  Bull,  Lion  and  Eagle.  The  fourth  form  is  found  either  as  Scorpion  or  Eagle  depending  upon  the <br/>Occult  good  or  evil  intention:  in  the  Demotic  Zodiac,  the  Snake  replaces  the  Scorpion. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Lower  Region  he  ascribes  to  the  twelve  simple  Hebrew  letters,  associating  them  with  the  four <br/>quarters  of  the  horizon.  Compare  the  Sepher  Yerzirah,  Cap.  v.,  sec.  1. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Central  Region  he  ascribes  to  the  Solar  powers  and  the <br/><br/><br/>A <br/><br/>&quot;JT    o  3L <br/><br/>A <br/><br/>Q  o <br/><br/>/A <br/><br/>ft  ruiftt  tcwa <br/><br/>f <br/><br/>V <br/><br/>If  Tftfie  JttVTe <br/><br/>\/ <br/><br/>\/ <br/><br/>\/ <br/><br/>LEVI'S  KEY  TO  THE  BEMBINE  TABLE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Levi's  History  of  Magic. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Isiac  Tablet,  writes  Levi,  is  a  Key  to  the  Ancient  Book  of  Thoth,  which  has  survived  to  some  extent  the  lapse  of <br/>centuries  and  is  pictured  to  us  in  the  still  comparatively  ancient  set  of  Tarocchi  Cards.  To  him  the  Book  of  Thoth  was  a <br/>resume  of  the  esoteric  learning  of  the  Egyptians,  after  the  decadence  of  their  civilization,  this  lore  became  crystallized  in  a <br/>hieroglyphic  form  as  the  Tarot;  this  Tarot  having  become  partially  or  entirely  forgotten  or  misunderstood,  its  pictured <br/>symbols  fell  into  the  hands  of  the  sham  diviners,  and  of  the  providers  of  the  public  amusement  by  games  of  Cards.  The <br/>modem  Tarot,  or  Tarocchi  pack  of  cards  consists  of  78  cards,  of  which  22  form  a  special  group  of  trumps,  of  pictorial <br/>design:  the  remaining  56  are  composed  of  four  suits  of  10  numerals  and  four  court  cards.  King,  Queen,  Knight,  and  Knave <br/>or  Valet;  the  suits  are  Swords  (Militaryism),  Cups  (Sacerdocy),  Clubs  or  Wands  (Agriculture),  and  Shekels  or  Coins <br/>(Commerce),  answering  respectively  to  our  Spades,  Hearts,  Clubs  and  Diamonds.  Our  purpose  is  with  the  22  trumps, <br/>these  form  the  special  characteristic  of  the  Pack  and  are  the  lineal  descendants  of  the  Hieroglyphics  of  the  Tarot.  These  22 <br/>respond  to  the  letters  of  the  Hebrew  and  other  sacred  alphabets,  which  fall  naturally  into  three  classes  of  a  Trio  of <br/>Mothers,  a  Heptad  of  doubles,  and  a  duodecad  of  simple  letters.  They  are  also  considered  as  a  triad  of  Heptads  and  one <br/>apart,  a  system  of  Initiation  and  an  Uninitiate.&quot;  (See  Westcott's  The  Isiac  Tablet.) <br/><br/>p.  58 <br/><br/>Planetary.  In  the  middle  we  see  above,  the  Sun,  marked  Ops,  and  below  it  is  a  Solomon's  Seal,  above  a <br/>cross;  a  double  triangle  Hexapla,  one  light  and  one  dark  triangle  superposed,  the  whole  forming  a  sort <br/>of  complex  symbol  of  Venus.  To  the  Ibimorphos  he  gives  the  three  dark  planets,  Venus,  Mercury,  and <br/>Mars  placed  around  a  dark  triangle  erect,  denoting  Fire.  To  the  Nephthsean  triad  he  gives  three  light <br/>planets,  Saturn,  Luna,  and  Jupiter,  around  a  light  inverted  triangle  which  denotes  Water.  There  is  a <br/>necessary  connection  between  water,  female  power,  passive  principle,  Binah,  and  Sephirotic  Mother, <br/>and  Bride.  (See  the  Kabbalah  by  Mathers.)  Note  the  ancient  signs  for  the  planets  were  all  composed <br/>of  a  Cross,  Solar  Disc  and  Crescent:  Venus  is  a  cross  below  a  Sun  disc,  Mercury,  a  disc  With  a  crescent <br/>above  and  cross  below,  Saturn  is  a  Cross  whose  lowest  point  touches  the  apex  of  the  crescent;  Jupiter <br/>is  a  Crescent  whose  lowest  point  touches  the  left  hand  end  of  a  cross:  all  these  are  deep  mysteries. <br/>Note  that  Levi  in  his  original  plate  transposed  Serapis  and  Hecate,  but  not  the  Apis  noir  and  Apis <br/>blanc,  perhaps  because  of  the  head  of  Bes  being  associated  by  him  with  Hecate.  Note  that  having <br/>referred  the  12  simple  letters  to  the  lower,  the  7  double  must  correspond  to  the  central  region  of  the <br/>planets,  and  then  the  great  triad  A.M.S.  the  mother  letters  representing  Air,  Water,  and  Fire  remain <br/>to  be  pictured,  around  S  the  Central  lynx,  or  Yod,  by  the  Ophionian  Triad  the  two  Serpents  and  the <br/>Leonine  Sphynx.  Levi's  word  OPS  in  the  centre  is  the  Latin  Ops,  Terra,  genius  of  the  Earth;  and  the <br/>Greek  Ops,  Rhea,  or  Kubele  (Cybele)  often  drawn  as  a  goddess  seated  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  lions;  she <br/>is  crowned  with  turrets,  and  holds  a  Key.&quot;  (See  The  Isiac  Tablet.) <br/><br/><br/>The  essay  published  in  French  by  Alexandre  Lenoir  in  1809,  while  curious  and  original,  contains  little <br/>real  information  on  the  Tablet,  which  the  author  seeks  to  prove  was  an  Egyptian  calendar  or <br/>astrological  chart.  As  both  Montfaucon  and  Lenoir~in  fact  all  writers  on  the  subject  since  i65i~either <br/>have  based  their  work  upon  that  of  Kircher  or  have  been  influenced  considerably  by  him,  a  careful <br/>translation  has  been  made  of  the  latter's  original  article  (eighty  pages  of  seventeenth  century  Latin). <br/>The  double-page  plate  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter  is  a  faithful  reproduction  made  by  Kircher <br/>from  the  engraving  in  the  Museum  of  Hieroglyphics.  The  small  letters  and  numbers  used  to  designate <br/>the  figures  were  added  by  him  to  clarify  his  commentary  and  will  be  used  for  the  same  purpose  in  this <br/>work. <br/><br/>Like  nearly  all  religious  and  philosophical  antiquities,  the  Bembine  Table  of  Isis  has  been  the  subject <br/>of  much  controversy.  In  a  footnote,  A.  E.  Waite&#x2014;unable  to  differentiate  between  the  true  and  the <br/>purported  nature  or  origin  of  the  Tablet&#x2014;echoes  the  sentiments  of  J.G.  Wilkinson,  another  eminent <br/>exotericus:  &quot;The  original  [Table]  is  exceedingly  late  and  is  roughly  termed  a  forgery.&quot;  On  the  other <br/>hand,  Eduard  Winkelmann,  a  man  of  profound  learning,  defends  the  genuineness  and  antiquity  of  the <br/>Tablet.  A  sincere  consideration  of  the  Mensa  Isiaca  discloses  one  fact  of  paramount  importance:  that <br/>although  whoever  fashioned  the  Table  was  not  necessarily  an  Egyptian,  he  was  an  initiate  of  the <br/>highest  order,  conversant  with  the  most  arcane  tenets  of  Hermetic  esotericism. <br/><br/>SYMBOLISM  OF  THE  BEMBINE  TABLE <br/><br/>The  following  necessarily  brief  elucidation  of  the  Bembine  Table  is  based  upon  a  digest  of  the  writings <br/>of  Kircher  supplemented  by  other  information  gleaned  by  the  present  author  from  the  mystical <br/>writings  of  the  Chaldeans,  Hebrews,  Egyptians,  and  Greeks.  The  temples  of  the  Egyptians  were  so <br/>designed  that  the  arrangement  of  chambers,  decorations,  and  utensils  was  all  of  symbolic  significance, <br/>as  shown  by  the  hieroglyphics  that  covered  them.  Beside  the  altar,  which  usually  was  in  the  center  of <br/>each  room,  was  the  cistern  of  Nile  water  which  flowed  in  and  out  through  unseen  pipes.  Here  also <br/>were  images  of  the  gods  in  concatenated  series,  accompanied  by  magical  inscriptions.  In  these <br/>temples,  by  use  of  symbols  and  hieroglyphics,  neophytes  were  instructed  in  the  secrets  of  the <br/>sacerdotal  caste. <br/><br/>The  Tablet  of  Isis  was  originally  a  table  or  altar,  and  its  emblems  were  part  of  the  mysteries  explained <br/>by  priests.  Tables  were  dedicated  to  the  various  gods  and  goddesses;  in  this  case  Isis  was  so  honored. <br/>The  substances  from  which  the  tables  were  made  differed  according  to  the  relative  dignities  of  the <br/>deities.  The  tables  consecrated  to  Jupiter  and  Apollo  were  of  gold;  those  to  Diana,  Venus,  and  Juno <br/>were  of  silver;  those  to  the  other  superior  gods,  of  marble;  those  to  the  lesser  divinities,  of  wood. <br/>Tables  were  also  made  of  metals  corresponding  to  the  planets  governed  by  the  various  celestials.  As <br/>food  for  the  body  is  spread  on  a  banquet  table,  so  on  these  sacred  altars  were  spread  the  symbols <br/>which,  when  understood,  feed  the  invisible  nature  of  man. <br/><br/>In  his  introduction  to  the  Table,  Kircher  summarizes  its  symbolism  thus:  &quot;It  teaches,  in  the  first  place, <br/>the  whole  constitution  of  the  threefold  world&#x2014;archetypal,  intellectual,  and  sensible.  The  Supreme <br/>Divinity  is  shown  moving  from  the  center  to  the  circumference  of  a  universe  made  up  of  both  sensible <br/>and  inanimate  things,  all  of  which  are  animated  and  agitated  by  the  one  supreme  power  which  they <br/>call  the  Father  Mind  and  represented  by  a  threefold  symbol.  Here  also  are  shown  three  triads  from <br/>the  Supreme  One,  each  manifesting  one  attribute  of  the  first  Trimurti.  These  triads  are  called  the <br/>Foundation,  or  the  base  of  all  things.  In  the  Table  is  also  set  forth  the  arrangement  and  distribution  of <br/>those  divine  creatures  that  aid  the  Father  Mind  in  the  control  of  the  universe.  Here  [in  the  upper <br/>panel]  are  to  be  seen  the  Governors  of  the  worlds,  each  with  its  fiery,  ethereal,  and  material  insignia. <br/>Here  also  [in  the  lower  panel]  are  the  Fathers  of  Fountains,  whose  duty  it  is  to  care  for  and  preserve <br/>the  principles  of  all  things  and  sustain  the  inviolable  laws  of  Nature.  Here  are  the  gods  of  the  spheres <br/>and  also  those  who  wander  from  place  to  place,  laboring  with  all  substances  and  forms  (Zonia  and <br/>Azonia),  grouped  together  as  figures  of  both  sexes,  with  their  faces  turned  to  their  superior  deity.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>The  Mensa  Isiaca,  which  is  divided  horizontally  into  three  chambers  or  panels,  may  represent  the <br/>ground  plan  of  the  chambers  in  which  the  Isiac  Mysteries  were  given.  The  center  panel  is  divided  into <br/>seven  parts  or  lesser  rooms,  and  the  lower  has  two  gates,  one  at  each  end.  The  entire  Table  contains <br/>forty-five  figures  of  first  importance  and  a  number  of  lesser  symbols.  The  forty-five  main  figures  are <br/>grouped  into  fifteen  triads,  of  which  four  are  in  the  upper  panel,  seven  in  the  central,  and  four  in  the <br/>lower.  According  to  both  Kircher  and  Levi,  the  triads  are  divided  in  the  following  manner: <br/><br/>In  the  upper  section <br/><br/>1.  P,  S,  V~Mendesian  Triad. <br/><br/>2.  X,  Z,  A~Ammonian  Triad. <br/><br/>3.  B,  C,  D~Momphtaean  Triad. <br/><br/>4.  F,  G,  H-Omphtsean  Triad. <br/>In  the  center  section <br/><br/>1.  G,  I,  K~Isiac  Triad. <br/><br/>2.  L,  M,  N~Hecatine  Triad. <br/><br/>3.  O,  Q,  R~Ibimorphous  Triad. <br/><br/>4.  V,  S,  W~Ophionic  Triad. <br/><br/>5.  X,  Y,  Z~Nephtaean  Triad. <br/><br/>6.  4  ri,  9~Serapsean  Triad. <br/><br/>7.  Y,  8  (not  shown),  e&#x2014;Osirian  Triad. <br/>In  the  lower  section <br/><br/>1.  X,  M,  N~Horaean  Triad. <br/><br/>2.  ^,  0, 2~Pandoch&#x00a3;ean  Triad. <br/><br/>3.  T,  O,  X-Thaustic  Triad. <br/><br/>4.  W,  F,  H~7Eluristic  Triad. <br/><br/>Of  these  fifteen  triads  Kircher  writes:  &quot;The  figures  differ  from  each  other  in  eight  highly  important <br/>respects,  i.  e.,  according  to  form,  position,  gesture,  act,  raiment,  headdress,  staff,  and,  lastly, <br/>according  to  the  hieroglyphics  placed  around  them,  whether  these  be  flowers,  shrubs,  small  letters  or <br/>animals.&quot;  These  eight  symbolic  methods  of  portraying  the  secret  powers  of  the  figures  are  subtle <br/>reminders  of  the  eight  spiritual  senses  of  cognition  by  means  of  which  the  Real  Self  in  man  may  be <br/>comprehended.  To  express  this  spiritual  truth  the  Buddhists  used  the  wheel  with  eight  spokes  and <br/>raised  their  consciousness  by  means  of  the  noble  eightfold  path.  The  ornamented  border  enclosing <br/>the  three  main  panels  of  the  Table  contains  many  symbols  consisting  of  birds,  animals,  reptiles, <br/>human  beings,  and  composite  forms.  According  to  one  reading  of  the  Table,  this  border  represents <br/><br/><br/>the  four  elements;  the  creatures  are  elemental  beings.  According  to  another  interpretation,  the  border <br/><br/>represents  the  archetypal  spheres,  and  in  its  frieze  of  composite  figures  are  the  patterns  of  those <br/>forms  which  in  various  combinations  will  subsequently  manifest  themselves  in  the  material  world. <br/>The  four  flowers  at  the  corners  of  the  Table  are  those  which,  because  their  blossoms  always  face  the <br/>sun  and  follow  its  course  across  the  sky,  are  sacred  emblems  of  that  finer  part  of  man's  nature  which <br/>delights  in  facing  its  Creator. <br/><br/>According  to  the  secret  doctrine  of  the  Chaldeans,  the  universe  is  divided  into  four  states  of  being <br/>(planes  or  spheres):  archetypal,  intellectual,  sidereal,  and  elemental.  Each  of  these  reveals  the  others; <br/>the  superior  controlling  the  inferior,  and  the  inferior  receiving  influence  from  the  superior.  The <br/>archetypal  plane  was  considered  synonymous  with  the  intellect  of  the  Triune  Divinity.  Within  this <br/>divine,  incorporeal,  and  eternal  sphere  are  included  all  the  lower  manifestations  of  life-all  that  is,  has <br/>been,  or  ever  shall  be.  Within  the  Kosmic  Intellect  all  things  spiritual  or  material  exist  as  archetypes, <br/>or  divine  thought-forms,  which  is  shown  in  the  Table  by  a  chain  of  secret  similes. <br/><br/>In  the  middle  region  of  the  Table  appears  the  all-form-containing  personified  Spiritual  Essence&#x2014;the <br/>source  and  substance  of  all  things.  From  this  proceed  the  lower  worlds  as  nine  emanations  in  groups <br/>of  three  (the  Ophionic,  Ibimorphous,  and  Nephtsean  Triads).  Consider  in  this  connection  the  analogy <br/>of  the  Qabbalistic  Sephiroth,  or  the  nine  spheres  issuing  from  Kether,  the  Crown.  The  twelve <br/>Governors  of  the  Universe  (the  Mendesian,  Ammonian,  Momphtsean,  and  Omphteean  Triads)-- <br/>vehicles  for  the  distribution  of  the  creative  influences,  and  shown  in  the  upper  region  of  the  Table-are <br/>directed  in  their  activities  by  the  Divine  Mind  patterns  existing  in  the  archetypal  sphere,  The <br/>archetypes  are  abstract  patterns  formulated  in  the  Divine  Mind  and  by  them  all  the  inferior  activities <br/>are  controlled. <br/><br/>P-  59 <br/><br/>In  the  lower  region  of  the  Table  are  the  Father  Fountains  (the  Horeean,  Pandochsean,  Thaustic,  and <br/>iEluristic  Triads),  keepers  of  the  great  gates  of  the  universe.  These  distribute  to  the  lower  worlds  the <br/>influences  descending  from  the  Governors  shown  above. <br/><br/>In  the  theology  of  the  Egyptians,  goodness  takes  precedence  and  all  things  partake  of  its  nature  to  a <br/>higher  or  lower  degree.  Goodness  is  sought  by  all.  It  is  the  Prime  Cause  of  causes.  Goodness  is  self- <br/>diffused  and  hence  exists  in  all  things,  for  nothing  can  produce  that  which  it  does  not  have  in  itself. <br/>The  Table  demonstrates  that  all  is  in  God  and  God  is  in  all;  that  all  is  in  all  and  each  is  in  each.  In  the <br/>intellectual  world  are  invisible  spiritual  counterparts  of  the  creatures  which  inhabit  the  elemental <br/>world.  Therefore,  the  lowest  exhibits  the  highest,  the  corporeal  declares  the  intellectual,  and  the <br/>invisible  i,.  made  manifest  by  its  works.  For  this  reason  the  Egyptians  made  images  of  substances <br/>existing  in  the  inferior  sensible  world  to  serve  as  visible  exemplars  of  superior  and  invisible  powers. <br/>To  the  corruptible  images  they  assigned  the  virtues  of  the  incorruptible  divinities,  thus  demonstrating <br/>arcanely  that  this  world  is  but  the  shadow  of  God,  the  outward  picture  of  the  paradise  within.  All  that <br/>is  in  the  invisible  archetypal  sphere  is  revealed  in  the  sensible  corporeal  world  by  the  light  of  Nature. <br/><br/>The  Archetypal  and  Creative  Mind&#x2014;first  through  its  Paternal  Foundation  and  afterwards  through <br/>secondary  Gods  called  Intelligences&#x2014; poured  our  the  whole  infinity  of  its  powers  by  continuous <br/>exchange  from  highest  to  lowest.  In  their  phallic  symbolism  the  Egyptians  used  the  sperm  to <br/>represent  the  spiritual  spheres,  because  each  contains  all  that  comes  forth  from  it.  The  Chaldeans  and <br/>Egyptians  also  held  that  everything  which  is  a  result  dwells  in  the  cause  of  itself  and  turns  to  that <br/>cause  as  the  lotus  to  the  sun.  Accordingly,  the  Supreme  Intellect,  through  its  Paternal  Foundation, <br/>first  created  light&#x2014; the  angelic  world.  Out  of  that  light  were  then  created  the  invisible  hierarchies  of <br/>beings  which  some  call  the  stars;  and  out  of  the  stars  the  four  elements  and  the  sensible  world  were <br/>formed.  Thus  all  are  in  all,  after  their  respective  kinds.  All  visible  bodies  or  elements  are  in  the <br/>invisible  stars  or  spiritual  elements,  and  the  stars  are  likewise  in  those  bodies;  the  stars  are  in  the <br/><br/><br/>angels  and  the  angels  in  the  stars;  the  angels  are  in  God  and  God  is  in  all.  Therefore,  all  are  divinely  in <br/>the  Divine,  angelically  in  the  angels,  and  corporeally  in  the  corporeal  world,  and  vice  versa,  just  as  the <br/>seed  is  the  tree  folded  up,  so  the  world  is  God  unfolded. <br/><br/>Proclus  says:  &quot;Every  property  of  divinity  permeates  all  creation  and  gives  itself  to  all  inferior  creatures. <br/>&quot;One  of  the  manifestations  of  the  Supreme  Mind  is  the  power  of  reproduction  according  to  species <br/>which  it  confers  upon  every  creature  of  which  it  is  the  divine  part.  Thus  souls,  heavens,  elements, <br/>animals,  plants,  and  stones  generate  themselves  each  according  to  its  pattern,  but  all  are  dependent <br/>upon  the  one  fertilizing  principle  existing  in  the  Supreme  Mind.  The  fecundative  power,  though  of <br/>itself  a  unit,  manifests  differently  through  the  various  substances,  for  in  the  mineral  it  contributes  to <br/>material  existence,  in  the  plant  it  manifests  as  vitality,  and  in  the  animal  as  sensibility.  It  imparts <br/>motion  to  the  heavenly  bodies,  thought  to  the  souls  of  men,  intellectuality  to  the  angels,  and <br/>superessentiality  to  God.  Thus  it  is  seen  that  all  forms  are  of  one  substance  and  all  life  of  one  force, <br/>and  these  are  co-existent  in  the  nature  of  the  Supreme  One. <br/><br/>This  doctrine  was  first  expounded  by  Plato.  His  disciple,  Aristotle,  set  it  forth  in  these  words:  &quot;We  say <br/>that  this  Sensible  World  is  an  image  of  another;  therefore  since  this  world  is  vivid  or  alive,  how  much <br/>more,  then,  that  other  must  live.  *  *  *  Yonder,  therefore,  above  the  stellar  virtues,  stand  other  heavens <br/>to  be  attained,  like  the  heavens  of  this  world;  beyond  them,  because  they  are  of  a  higher  kind,  brighter <br/>and  vaster;  nor  are  they  distant  from  each  Other  like  this  one,  for  they  are  incorporeal.  Yonder,  too, <br/>exists  an  earth,  not  of  inanimate  matter,  but  vivid  with  animal  life  and  all  natural  terrestrial <br/>phenomena  like  this  one,  but  of  other  kinds  and  perfections.  There  are  plants,  also,  and  gardens,  and <br/>flowing  water;  there  are  aquatic  animals  but  of  nobler  species.  Yonder  is  air  and  life  appropriate  to  it, <br/>all  immortal.  And  although  the  life  there  is  analogous  to  ours,  yet  it  is  nobler,  seeing  that  it  is <br/>intellectual,  perpetual  and  unalterable.  For  if  anyone  should  object  and  ask,  How  in  the  world  above <br/>do  the  plants,  etc.  above  mentioned  find  footing,  we  should  answer  that  they  do  not  have  objective <br/>existence,  for  they  were  produced  by  the  primal  Author  in  an  absolute  condition  and  without <br/>exteriorization.  They  are,  therefore,  in  the  same  case  as  intellect  and  soul;  they  suffer  no  defect  such <br/>as  waste  and  corruption,  since  the  beings  yonder  are  full  of  energy,  strength  and  joy,  as  living  in  a  life <br/>sublime  and  being  the  issue  of  one  fount  and  of  one  quality,  compounded  of  all  like  sweet  savors, <br/>delicate  perfumes,  harmonious  color  and  sound,  and  other  perfections.  Nor  do  they  move  violently <br/>about  nor  intermix  nor  corrupt  each  other,  but  each  perfectly  preserves  its  own  essential  character; <br/>and  they  are  simple  and  do  not  multiply  as  corporeal  beings  do.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  midst  of  the  Table  is  a  great  covered  throne  with  a  seated  female  figure  representing  Isis,  but <br/>here  called  the  Pantomorphic  lYNX.  G.  R.  S.  Mead  defines  the  lYNX  as  &quot;a  transmitting  intelligence.&quot; <br/>Others  have  declared  it  to  be  a  symbol  of  Universal  Being.  Over  the  head  of  the  goddess  the  throne  is <br/>surmounted  by  a  triple  crown,  and  beneath  her  feet  is  the  house  of  material  substance.  The  threefold <br/>crown  is  here  symbolic  of  the  Triune  Divinity,  called  by  the  Egyptians  the  Supreme  Mind,  and <br/>described  in  the  Sepher  ha  Zohar  as  being  &quot;hidden  and  unrevealed.&quot;  According  to  the  Hebrew  system <br/>of  Qabbalism,  the  Tree  of  the  Sephiroth  was  divided  into  two  parts,  the  upper  invisible  and  the  lower <br/>visible.  The  upper  consisted  of  three  parts  and  the  lower  of  seven.  The  three  uncognizable  Sephiroth <br/>were  called  Kether,  the  Crown;  Chochmah,  Wisdom;  and  Binah,  Understanding.  These  are  too <br/>abstract  to  permit  of  comprehension,  whereas  the  lower  seven  spheres  that  came  forth  from  them <br/>were  within  the  grasp  of  human  consciousness.  The  central  panel  contains  seven  triads  of  figures. <br/>These  represent  the  lower  Sephiroth,  all  emanating  from  the  concealed  threefold  crown  over  the <br/>throne. <br/><br/>Kircher  writes:  &quot;The  throne  denotes  the  diffusion  of  the  triform  Supreme  Mind  along  the  universal <br/>paths  of  the  three  worlds.  Out  of  these  three  intangible  spheres  emerges  the  sensible  universe,  which <br/>Plutarch  calls  the  'House  of  Horns'  and  the  Egyptians,  the  'Great  Gate  of  the  Gods.'  The  top  of  the <br/>throne  is  in  the  midst  of  diffused  serpent-shaped  flames,  indicating  that  the  Supreme  Mind  is  filled <br/>with  light  and  life,  eternal  and  incorruptible,  removed  from  all  material  contact.  How  the  Supreme <br/><br/><br/>Mind  communicated  His  fire  to  all  creatures  is  clearly  set  forth  in  the  symbolism  of  the  Table.  The <br/><br/>Divine  Fire  is  communicated  c  to  lower  spheres  through  the  universal  power  of  Nature  personified  by <br/>the  World  Virgin,  Isis,  here  denominated  the  lYNX,  or  the  polymorphous  all-containing  Universal <br/>Idea.&quot;  The  word  Idea  is  here  used  in  its  Platonic  sense.  &quot;Plato  believed  that  there  are  eternal  forms  of <br/>all  possible  things  which  exist  without  matter;  and  to  these  eternal  and  immaterial  forms  he  gave  the <br/>name  of  ideas.  In  the  Platonic  sense,  ideas  were  the  patterns  according  to  which  the  Deity  fashioned <br/>the  phenomenal  or  ectypal  world.&quot;  (Sir  W.  Hamilton.) <br/><br/>Kircher  describes  the  21  figures  in  the  central  panel  thus:  &quot;Seven  principal  triads,  corresponding  to <br/>seven  superior  worlds,  are  shown  in  the  central  section  of  the  Table.  They  all  originate  from  the  fiery, <br/>invisible  archetype  [the  triple  crown  of  the  throne].  The  first,  the  Ophionic  or  lYNX  Triad,  V  S  W, <br/>corresponds  to  the  vital  and  fiery  world  and  is  the  first  intellectual  world,  called  by  the  ancients  the <br/>Aetherium.  Zoroaster  says  of  it:  'Oh,  what  rigorous  rulers  this  world  has!'  The  second,  or  Ibimorphous <br/>Triad,  O  Q  R,  corresponds  to  the  second  intellectual,  or  ethereal,  world,  and  is  concerned  with  the <br/>principle  of  humidity.  The  third,  or  Nephtsean  Triad,  X  Y  Z,  corresponds  to  the  third  intellectual  and <br/>ethereal  [world]  and  is  concerned  with  fecundity.  These  are  the  three  triads  of  the  ethereal  worlds, <br/>which  correspond  to  the  Father  Foundation.  Then  follow  the  four  triads  of  the  sensible,  or  material, <br/>worlds,  of  which  the  first  two  correspond  to  the  sidereal  worlds,  G I  K  and  y  8  8,  namely,  Osiris  and <br/>Isis,  Sun  and  Moon,  indicated  by  two  bulls.  They  are  followed  by  two  triads&#x2014;the  Hecatine,  LM  N,  and <br/>the  Serapsean,  ^  r)  9,  corresponding  to  the  sublunary  and  subterranean  worlds.  These  complete  the <br/>seven  worlds  of  primary  Genii  ruling  the  natural  universe.  Psellus  quotes  Zoroaster:  'The  Egyptians <br/>and  the  Chaldeans,  taught  that  there  were  seven  corporeal  worlds  (i.  e.,  worlds  ruled  by  the <br/>intellectual  powers)  ;the  first  is  of  pure  fire;  the  second,  third,  and  fourth,  ethereal;  the  fifth,  sixth,  and <br/>seventh,  material;  the  seventh  being  the  one  called  terrestrial  and  hater  of  light,  and  is  located  under <br/>the  Moon,  comprising <br/><br/><br/>1 <br/><br/><br/>5 <br/><br/><br/>'  r <br/><br/><br/>./r <br/><br/><br/>I    M  fit <br/><br/><br/>a  q  f <br/><br/><br/>tYNX <br/><br/><br/>ItClNtS <br/><br/>2     I'n  jv <br/><br/><br/>X       Y  Z <br/><br/><br/>T       f  % <br/><br/><br/>I&quot;  &#x25a0;   if  e <br/><br/><br/>U  &amp; <br/><br/><br/>&#x2022;If  ff <br/><br/><br/>WESTCOTT'S  KEY  TO  THE  BEMBINE  TABLE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Westcott's  The  Isiac  Tablet. <br/><br/><br/>Zoroaster  declared  that  the  number  three  shines  throughout  the  world.  This  is  revealed  in  the  Bembine,  Table  by  a  series <br/>of  triads  representing  the  creative  impulses.  Of  the  Isiac  Table  Alexandre  Lenoir  writes:  &quot;The  Isiac  Table,  as  a  work  of  art, <br/>is  not  of  great  interest,  it  is  but  a  composition,  rather  cold  and  insignificant,  whose  figures,  summarily  sketched  and <br/>methodically  placed  near  each  other,  give  but  little  impression  of  life.  But,  if  on  the  contrary  after  examining  it,  we <br/>understand  the  purpose  of  the  author,  we  become  soon  convinced  that  the  Isiac  Table  is  an  image  of  the  heavenly  sphere <br/>divided  in  small  parts  to  be  used  very  like,  for  general  teaching.  According  to  that  idea,  we  can  conclude  that  the  Isiac <br/><br/><br/>Table  was  originally  the  introduction  to  a  collection  followed  by  the  Mysteries  of  Isis.  It  was  engraved  on  copper  in  order <br/>to  be  used  in  the  ceremonial  of  initiation.&quot;  (See  New  Essay  on  the  Isiac  Table.) <br/><br/>p.  60 <br/><br/>within  itself  the  matter  called  fundus,  or  foundation.  'These  seven,  plus  the  one  invisible  crown, <br/>constitute  the  eight  worlds.  *  *  * <br/><br/>&quot;Plato  writes  that  it  is  needful  for  the  philosopher  to  know  how  the  seven  circles  beneath  the  first  one <br/>are  arranged  according  to  the  Egyptians.  The  first  triad  of  fire  denotes  life;  the  second,  water,  over <br/>which  rule  the  Ibimorphous  divinities;  and  the  third,  air,  ruled  by  Nephta.  From  the  fire  the  heavens <br/>were  created,  from  the  water  the  earth,  and  air  was  the  mediator  between  them.  In  the  Sephira <br/>Yetzirah  it  is  said  that  from  the  three  originate  the  seven,  i.  e.,  the  height,  the  depth,  the  East,  the <br/>West,  the  North,  and  the  South,  and  the  Holy  Temple  in  the  center  sustaining  them  all.  Is  not  the <br/>Holy  Temple  in  the  center  the  great  throne  of  the  many-formed  Spirit  of  Nature  which  is  shoAAOi  in  the <br/>middle  of  the  Tablet?  What  are  the  seven  triads  but  the  seven  Powers  that  rule  over  the  world?  Psellus <br/>writes:  'The  Egyptians  worshipped  the  triad  of  faith,  truth,  and  love;  and  the  seven  fountains:  the  Sun <br/>as  ruler&#x2014;the  fountain  of  matter;  then  the  fountain  of  the  archangels;  the  fountain  of  the  senses;  of <br/>judgment;  of  lightning;  of  reflections;  and  of  characters  of  unknown  composition.  They  say  that  the <br/>highest  material  fountains  are  those  of  Apollo,  Osiris,  and  Mercury&#x2014; the  fountains  of  the  centers  of <br/>the  elements.  'Thus,  they  understood  by  the  Sun  as  ruler  the  solar  world;  by  the  material  archangelic, <br/>the  lunar  world;  by  the  fountain  of  the  senses,  the  world  of  Saturn;  by  judgment,  Jupiter;  by  lightning. <br/>Mars;  by  that  of  the  reflections,  or  mirrors,  the  world  of  Venus;  by  the  fountain  of  characters,  the <br/>world  of  Mercury.  All  these  are  shown  by  the  figures  in  the  center  pane  of  the  Tablet.&quot; <br/><br/>The  upper  panel  contains  the  twelve  figures  of  the  zodiac  arranged  in  four  triads.  The  center  figure  in <br/>each  group  represents  one  of  the  four  fixed  signs  of  the  zodiac.  S  is  the  sign  of  Aquarius;  Z,  Taurus;  C, <br/>Leo;  and  G,  Scorpio.  These  are  called  the  Fathers.  In  the  secret  teachings  of  the  Far  East  these  four <br/>figures&#x2014; the  man,  the  bull,  the  lion,  and  the  eagle&#x2014; are  called  the  winged  globes  or  the  four <br/>Maharajahs  who  stand  upon  the  corners  of  creation.  The  four  cardinal  signs&#x2014; P,  Capricorn;  X,  Aries; <br/>B,  Cancer;  F,  Libra&#x2014; are  called  the  Powers.  The  four  common  signs&#x2014; V,  Pisces;  A,  Gemini;  E,  Virgo;  H, <br/>Sagittarius&#x2014; are  called  the  Minds  of  the  Four  Lords.  This  explains  the  meaning  of  the  winged  globes  of <br/>Egypt,  for  the  four  central  figures&#x2014; Aquarius,  Taurus,  Leo,  and  Scorpio  (called  by  Ezekiel  the <br/>Cherubim)&#x2014; are  the  globes;  the  cardinal  and  common  signs  on  either  side  are  the  wings.  Therefore  the <br/>twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac  may  be  symbolized  by  four  globes,  each  with  two  wings. <br/><br/>The  celestial  triads  are  further  shown  by  the  Egyptians  as  a  globe  (the  Father)  from  which  issue  a <br/>serpent  (the  Mind)  and  wings  (the  Power).  These  twelve  forces  are  the  fabricators  of  the  world,  and <br/>from  them  emanate  the  microcosm,  or  the  mystery  of  the  twelve  sacred  animals&#x2014; representing  in  the <br/>universe  the  twelve  parts  of  the  world  and  in  man  the  twelve  parts  of  the  human  body.  Anatomically, <br/>the  twelve  figures  in  the  upper  panel  may  well  symbolize  the  twelve  convolutions  of  the  brain  and  the <br/>twelve  figures  in  the  lower  panel  the  twelve  zodiacal  members  and  organs  of  the  human  body,  for  man <br/>is  a  creature  formed  of  the  twelve  sacred  animals  with  his  members  and  organs  under  the  direct <br/>control  of  the  twelve  governors  or  powers  resident  in  the  brain. <br/><br/>A  more  profound  interpretation  is  found  in  the  correspondences  between  the  twelve  figures  in  the <br/>upper  panel  and  the  twelve  in  the  lower.  This  furnishes  a  key  to  one  of  the  most  arcane  of  ancient <br/>secrets&#x2014; the  relationship  existing  between  the  two  great  zodiacs  the  fixed  and  the  movable.  The  fixed <br/>zodiac  is  described  as  an  immense  dodecahedron,  its  twelve  surfaces  representing  the  outermost <br/>walls  of  abstract  space.  From  each  surface  of  this  dodecahedron  a  great  spiritual  power,  radiating <br/>inward,  becomes  embodied  as  one  of  the  hierarchies  of  the  movable  zodiac,  which  is  a  band  of <br/>circumambulating  so-called  fixed  stars.  Within  this  movable  zodiac  are  posited  the  various  planetary <br/>and  elemental  bodies.  The  relation  of  these  two  zodiacs  to  the  subzodiacal  spheres  has  a  correlation  in <br/><br/><br/>the  respiratory  system  of  the  human  body.  The  great  fixed  zodiac  maybe  said  to  represent  the <br/><br/>atmosphere,  the  movable  zodiac  the  lungs,  and  the  subzodiacal  worlds  the  body.  The  spiritual <br/>atmosphere  containing  the  vivifying  energies  of  the  twelve  divine  powers  of  the  great  fixed  zodiac  is <br/>inhaled  by  the  cosmic  lungs&#x2014;the  movable  zodiac&#x2014;and  distributed  by  them  through  the  constitution <br/>of  the  twelve  holy  animals  which  are  the  parts  and  members  of  the  material  universe.  The  functional <br/>cycle  is  completed  when  the  poisonous  effluvia  of  the  lower  worlds  collected  by  the  movable  zodiac <br/>are  exhaled  into  the  great  fixed  zodiac,  there  to  be  purified  by  being  passed  through  the  divine  natures <br/>of  its  twelve  eternal  hierarchies. <br/><br/>The  Table  as  a  whole  is  susceptible  of  many  interpretations.  If  the  border  of  the  Table  with  its <br/>hieroglyphic  figures  be  accepted  as  the  spiritual  source,  then  the  throne  in  the  center  represents  the <br/>physical  body  within  which  human  nature  is  enthroned.  From  this  point  of  view  the  entire  Table <br/>becomes  emblematic  of  the  auric  bodies  of  man,  with  the  border  as  the  outer  extremity  or  shell  of  the <br/>auric  egg.  If  the  throne  be  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  the  spiritual  sphere,  the  border  typifies  the <br/>elements,  and  the  various  panels  surrounding  the  central  one  become  emblematic  of  the  worlds  or <br/>planes  emanating  from  the  one  divine  source.  If  the  Table  be  considered  from  a  purely  physical  basis, <br/>the  throne  becomes  symbolic  of  the  generative  system  and  the  Table  reveals  the  secret  processes  of <br/>embryology  as  applied  to  the  formation  of  the  material  worlds.  If  a  purely  physiological  and <br/>anatomical  interpretation  be  desired,  the  central  throne  becomes  the  heart,  the  Ibimorphous  Triad <br/>the  mind,  the  Nephteean  Triad  the  generative  system,  and  the  surrounding  hieroglyphics  the  various <br/>parts  and  members  of  the  human  body.  From  the  evolutionary  viewpoint  the  central  gate  becomes  the <br/>point  of  both  entrance  and  exit.  Here  also  is  set  forth  the  process  of  initiation,  in  which  the  candidate <br/>after  passing  successfully  through  the  various  ordeals  is  finally  brought  into  the  presence  of  his  own <br/>soul,  which  he  alone  is  capable  of  unveiling. <br/><br/>If  cosmogony  be  the  subject  of  consideration,  the  central  panel  represents  the  spiritual  worlds,  the <br/>upper  panel  the  intellectual  worlds,  and  the  lower  panel  the  material  worlds.  The  central  panel  may <br/>also  symbolize  the  nine  invisible  worlds,  and  the  creature  marked  Tthe  physical  nature&#x2014; the  footstool <br/>of  Isis,  the  Spirit  of  Universal  Life.  Considered  in  the  light  of  alchemy,  the  central  panel  contains  the <br/>metals  and  the  borders  the  alchemical  processes.  The  figure  seated  on  the  throne  is  the  Universal <br/>Mercury&#x2014; the  &quot;stone  of  the  wise&quot;;  the  flaming  canopy  of  the  throne  above  is  the  Divine  Sulphur;  and <br/>the  cube  of  earth  beneath  is  the  elemental  salt. <br/><br/>The  three  triads&#x2014;or  the  Paternal  Foundation&#x2014; in  the  central  panel  represent  the  Silent  Watchers,  the <br/>three  invisible  parts  of  the  nature  of  man;  the  two  panels  on  either  side  are  the  quaternary  lower <br/>nature  of  man.  In  the  central  panel  are  21  figures.  This  number  is  sacred  to  the  sun&#x2014; which  consists  of <br/>three  great  powers,  each  with  seven  attributes&#x2014; and  by  Qabbalistic  reduction  21  becomes  3,  or  the <br/>Great  Triad. <br/><br/>It  will  yet  be  proved  that  the  Table  of  Isis  is  directly  connected  with  Egyptian  Gnosticism,  for  in  a <br/>Gnostic  papyrus  preserved  in  the  Bodleian  Library  there  is  a  direct  reference  to  the  twelve  Fathers  or <br/>Paternities  beneath  whom  are  twelve  Fountains.  (See  Egyptian  Magic  by  S.S.D.D.)  That  the  lower <br/>panel  represents  the  underworld  is  further  emphasized  by  the  two  gates&#x2014; the  great  gate  of  the  East <br/>and  the  great  gate  of  the  West&#x2014; for  in  the  Chaldean  theology  the  sun  rises  and  sets  through  gates  in <br/>the  underworld,  where  it  wanders  during  the  hours  of  darkness.  As  Plato  was  for  thirteen  years  under <br/>the  instruction  of  the  Magi  Patheneith,  Ochoaps,  Sechtnouphis,  and  Etymon  of  Sebbennithis,  his <br/>philosophy  consequently  is  permeated  with  the  Chaldean  and  Egyptian  system  of  triads.  The  Bembine <br/>Table  is  a  diagrammatic  exposition  of  the  so-called  Platonic  philosophy,  for  in  its  design  is  epitomized <br/>the  entire  theory  of  mystic  cosmogony  and  generation.  The  most  valuable  guide  to  the  interpretation <br/>of  this  Table  is  the  Commentaries  ofProclus  on  the  Theology  of  Plato.  The  Chaldean  Oracles  of <br/>Zoroaster  also  contains  many  allusions  to  the  theogonic  principles  which  are  demonstrated  by  the <br/>Table. <br/><br/><br/>The  Theogony  of  Hesiod  contains  the  most  complete  account  of  the  Greek  cosmogony  myth.  Orphic <br/>cosmogony  has  left  its  impress  upon  the  various  forms  of  philosophy  and  religion&#x2014;Greek,  Egyptian, <br/>and  Syrian&#x2014;which  it  contacted.  Chief  of  the  Orphic  symbols  was  the  mundane  egg  from  which <br/>Phanes  sprang  into  light.  Thomas  Taylor  considers  the  Orphic  egg  to  be  synonymous  with  the  mixture <br/>from  bound  and  infinity  mentioned  by  Plato  in  the  Philebus.  The  egg  is  furthermore  the  third <br/>Intelligible  Triad  and  the  proper  symbol  of  the  Demiurgus,  whose  auric  body  is  the  egg  of  the  inferior <br/>universe. <br/><br/>Eusebius,  on  the  authority  of  Porphyry,  declared  that  the  Egyptians  acknowledged  one  intellectual <br/>Author  or  Creator  of  the  world  under  the  name  of  Cneph  and  that  they  worshiped  him  in  a  statue  of <br/>human  form  and  dark  blue  complexion,  holding  in  his  hand  a  girdle  and  a  scepter,  wearing  on  his <br/>head  a  royal  plume,  and  thrusting  forth  an  egg  out  of  his  mouth.  (See  An  Analysis  of  the  Egyptian <br/>Mythology)  While  the  Bembine  Table  is  rectangular-shaped,  it  signifies  philosophically  the  Orphic <br/>egg  of  the  universe  with  its  contents.  In  the  esoteric  doctrines  the  supreme  individual  achievement  is <br/>the  breaking  of  the  Orphic  egg,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  return  of  the  spirit  to  the  Nirvana&#x2014;the <br/>absolute  condition&#x2014; of  the  Oriental  mystics. <br/><br/>The  New  Pantheon  by  Samuel  Boyse  contains  three  plates  showing  various  sections  of  the  Bembine <br/>Table.  The  author,  however,  makes  no  important  contribution  to  the  knowledge  of  the  subject.  In  The <br/>Mythology  and  Fables  of  the  Ancients  Explained  from  History,  the  Abbe  Banier  devotes  a  chapter  to <br/>a  consideration  of  the  Mensa  Isiaca.  After  reviewing  the  conclusions  of  Montfaucon,  Kircher,  and <br/>Pignorius,  he  adds:  &quot;I  am  of  the  opinion  that:  it  was  a  votive  table,  which  some  prince  or  private <br/>person  had  consecrated  to  Isis,  as  an  acknowledgment  for  some  benefit  which  he  believed  she  had <br/>conferred  upon  him.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>p.  61 <br/><br/>Wonders  of  Antiquity <br/><br/>IT  was  a  common  practice  among  the  early  Egyptians,  Greeks,  and  Romans  to  seal  lighted  lamps  in <br/>the  sepulchers  of  their  dead  as  offerings  to  the  God  of  Death.  Possibly  it  was  also  believed  that  the <br/>deceased  could  use  these  lights  in  finding  his  way  through  the  Valley  of  the  Shadow.  Later  as  the <br/>custom  became  generally  established,  not  only  actual  lamps  but  miniatures  of  them  in  terra  cotta <br/>were  buried  with  the  dead.  Some  of  the  lamps  were  enclosed  in  circular  vessels  for  protection;  and <br/>instances  have  been  recorded  in  which  the  original  oil  was  found  in  them,  in  a  perfect  state  of <br/>preservation,  after  more  than  2,000  years.  There  is  ample  proof  that  many  of  these  lamps  were <br/>burning  when  the  sepulchers  were  sealed,  and  it  has  been  declared  that  they  were  still  burning  when <br/>the  vaults  were  opened  hundreds  of  years  later.  The  possibility  of  preparing  a  fuel  which  would  renew <br/>itself  as  rapidly  as  it  was  consumed  has  been  a  source  of  considerable  controversy  among  mediseval <br/>authors.  After  due  consideration  of  the  evidence  at  hand,  it  seems  well  within  the  range  of  possibility <br/>that  the  ancient  priest-chemists  did  manufacture  lamps  that  burned,  if  not  indefinitely,  at  least  for <br/>considerable  periods  of  time. <br/><br/>Numerous  authorities  have  written  on  the  subject  of  ever-burning  lamps.  W.  Wynn  Westcott <br/>estimates  the  number  of  writers  who  have  given  the  subject  consideration  as  more  than  150,  and  H.  P. <br/>Blavatsky  as  173.  While  conclusions  reached  by  different  authors  are  at  variance,  a  majority  admit  the <br/>existence  of  these  phenomenal  lamps.  Only  a  few  maintained  that  the  lamps  would  burn  forever,  but <br/>many  were  willing  to  concede  that  they  might  remain  alight  for  several  centuries  without <br/>replenishment  of  the  fuel.  Some  considered  the  so-called  perpetual  lights  as  mere  artifices  of  the <br/>crafty  pagan  priests,  while  a  great  many,  admitting  that  the  lamps  actually  burned,  made  the <br/>sweeping  assertion  that  the  Devil  was  using  this  apparent  miracle  to  ensnare  the  credulous  and <br/>thereby  lead  their  souls  to  perdition. <br/><br/>On  this  subject  the  learned  Jesuit,  Athanasius  Kircher,  usually  dependable,  exhibits  a  striking <br/>inconsistency.  In  his  CEdipus  ^gyptiacus  he  writes:  &quot;Not  a  few  of  these  ever-burning  lamps  have <br/>been  found  to  be  the  devices  of  devils,  *  *  *  And  I  take  it  that  all  the  lamps  found  in  the  tombs  of  the <br/>Gentiles  dedicated  to  the  worship  of  certain  gods,  were  of  this  kind,  not  because  they  burned,  or  have <br/>been  reported  to  burn,  with  a  perpetual  flame,  but  because  probably  the  devil  set  them  there, <br/>maliciously  intending  thereby  to  obtain  fresh  credence  for  a  false  worship.&quot; <br/><br/>Having  admitted  that  dependable  authorities  defend  the  existence  of  the  ever-burning  lamps,  and <br/>that  even  the  Devil  lends  himself  to  their  manufacture,  Kircher  next  declared  the  entire  theory  to  be <br/>desperate  and  impossible,  and  to  be  classed  with  perpetual  motion  and  the  Philosopher's  Stone. <br/>Having  already  solved  the  problem  to  his  satisfaction  once,  Kircher  solves  it  again&#x2014;but  differently&#x2014;in <br/>the  following  words:  &quot;In  Egypt  there  are  rich  deposits  of  asphalt  and  petroleum.  What  did  these  clever <br/>fellows  [the  priests]  do,  then,  but  connect  an  oil  deposit  by  a  secret  duct  with  one  or  more  lamps, <br/>provided  with  wicks  of  asbestos!  How  could  such  lamps  help  burning  perpetually?  *  *  *  In  my  opinion <br/>this  is  the  solution  of  the  riddle  of  the  supernatural  everlastingness  of  these  ancient  lamps.&quot; <br/><br/>Montfaucon,  in  his  Antiquities,  agrees  in  the  main  with  the  later  deductions  of  Kircher,  believing  the <br/>fabled  perpetual  lamps  of  the  temples  to  be  cunning  mechanical  contrivances.  He  further  adds  that <br/>the  belief  that  lamps  burned  indefinitely  in  tombs  was  the  result  of  the  noteworthy  fact  that  in  some <br/>cases  fumes  resembling  smoke  poured  forth  from  the  entrances  of  newly  opened  vaults.  Parties  going <br/>in  later  and  discovering  lamps  scattered  about  the  floor  assumed  that  they  were  the  source  of  the <br/>fumes. <br/><br/><br/>There  are  several  interesting  stories  concerning  the  discoveries  of  ever-burning  lamps  in  various  parts <br/>of  the  world.  In  a  tomb  on  the  Appian  Way  which  was  opened  during  the  papacy  of  Paul  III  was  found <br/>a  burning  lamp  which  had  remained  alight  in  a  hermetically  sealed  vault  for  nearly  1,600  years. <br/>According  to  an  account  written  by  a  contemporary,  a  body&#x2014;that  of  a  young  and  beautiful  girl  with <br/>long  golden  hair &#x2014;was  found  floating  in  an  unknown  transparent  liquid  and  as  well  preserved  as <br/>though  death  had  occurred  but  a  few  hours  before.  About  the  interior  of  the  vault  were  a  number  of <br/>significant  objects,  which  included  several  lamps,  one  of  them  alight.  Those  entering  the  sepulcher <br/>declared  that  the  draft  caused  by  the  opening  of  the  door  blew  out  the  light  and  the  lamp  could  not  be <br/>relighted.  Kircher  reproduces  an  epitaph,  &quot;TULLIOLAE  FILIAE  MEAE,&quot;  supposedly  found  in  the <br/>tomb,  but  which  Montfaucon  declares  never  existed,  the  latter  adding  that  although  conclusive <br/>evidence  was  not  found,  the  body  was  generally  believed  to  be  that  of  TuUiola,  the  daughter  of  Cicero. <br/><br/>Ever-burning  lamps  have  been  discovered  in  all  parts  of  the  world.  Not  only  the  Mediterranean <br/>countries  but  also  India,  Tibet,  China,  and  South  America  have  contributed  records  of  lights  which <br/>burned  continuously  without  fuel.  The  examples  which  follow  were  selected  at  random  from  the <br/>imposing  list  of  perpetual  lamps  found  in  different  ages. <br/><br/>Plutarch  wrote  of  a  lamp  that  burned  over  the  door  of  a  temple  to  Jupiter  Ammon;  the  priests <br/>declared  that  it  had  remained  alight  for  centuries  without  fuel. <br/><br/>St.  Augustine  described  a  perpetual  lamp,  guarded  in  a  temple  in  Egypt  sacred  to  Venus,  which <br/>neither  wind  nor  water  could  extinguish.  He  believed  it  to  be  the  work  of  the  Devil. <br/><br/>An  ever-burning  lamp  was  found  at  Edessa,  or  Antioch,  during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Justinian.  It <br/>was  in  a  niche  over  the  city  gate,  elaborately  enclosed  to  protect  it  from  the  elements.  The  date  upon  it <br/>proved  that  the  lamp  had  been  burning  for  more  than  500  years.  It  was  destroyed  by  soldiers. <br/><br/>During  the  early  Middle  Ages  a  lamp  was  found  in  England  which  had  burned  since  the  third  century <br/>after  Christ.  The  monument  containing  it  was  believed  to  be  the  tomb  of  the  father  of  Constantine  the <br/>Great. <br/><br/>The  Lantern  of  Pallas  was  discovered  near  Rome  in  A.D.  1401.  It  was  found  in  the  sepulcher  of  Pallas, <br/>son  of  Evander,  immortalized  by  Virgil  in  his  ^nezd.  The  lamp  was  placed  at  the  head  of  the  body  and <br/>had  burned  with  a  steady  glow  for  more  than  2,000  years. <br/><br/>In  A.D.  1550  on  the  island  of  Nesis,  in  the  Bay  of  Naples,  a  magnificent  marble  vault  was  opened  in <br/>which  was  found  a  lamp  still  alight  which  had  been  placed  there  before  the  beginning  of  the  Christian <br/>Era. <br/><br/>Pausanias  described  a  beautiful  golden  lamp  in  the  temple  of  Minerva  which  burned  steadily  for  a <br/>year  without  refueling  or  having  the  wick  trimmed.  The  ceremony  of  filling  the  lamp  took  place <br/>annually,  and  time  was  measured  by  the  ceremony. <br/><br/>According  to  the  Fama  Fraternitatis,  the  crypt  of  Christian  Rosencreutz  when  opened  120  years  after <br/>his  death  was  found  to  be  brilliantly  illuminated  by  a  perpetual  lamp  suspended  from  the  ceiling. <br/><br/>Numa  Pompilius,  King  of  Rome  and  magician  of  considerable  power,  caused  a  perpetual  light  to  burn <br/>in  the  dome  of  a  temple  he  had  created  in  honor  of  an  elemental  being. <br/><br/>In  England  a  curious  tomb  was  found  containing <br/><br/><br/>BASE  OF  A  DELPHIAN  TRIPOD. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/>The  windings  of  these  serpents  formed  the  base,  and  the  three  heads  sustained  the  three  feet  of  the  tripod.  It  is  impossible <br/>to  secure  satisfactory  information  concerning  the  shape  and  size  of  the  celebrated  Delphian  tripod.  Theories  concerning  it <br/>are  based  (in  most  part)  upon  small  ornamental  tripods  discovered  in  various  temples. <br/><br/><br/>THE  DELPHIAN  TRIPOD  RESTORED. <br/><br/>From  Beaumont's  Gleanings  of  Antiquities. <br/><br/>According  to  Beaumont,  the  above  is  the  most  authentic  form  of  the  Delphian  tripod  extant;  but  as  the  tripod  must  have <br/>changed  considerably  during  the  life  of  the  oracle,  hasty  conclusions  are  unwise.  In  his  description  of  the  tripod, <br/>Beaumont  divides  it  into  four  Parts:  (i)  a  frame  with  three  (2),  a  reverberating  basin  or  bowl  set  in  the  frame;  (e)  a  flat <br/>plate  or  table  upon  which  the  Pythia  sat;  and  (4)  a  cone-shaped  cover  over  the  table,  which  completely  concealed  the <br/>priestess  and  from  beneath  which  her  voice  sounded  forth  in  weird  and  hollow  tones.  Attempts  have  been  made  to  relate <br/>the  Delphian  tripod  with  the  Jewish  Ark  of  the  Covenant.  The  frame  of  three  legs  was  likened  to  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant; <br/>the  flat  plate  or  table  to  the  Mercy  Seat;  and  the  cone-shaped  covering  to  the  tent  of  the  Tabernacle  itself.  This  entire <br/><br/><br/>conception  differs  widely  from  that  popularly  accepted,  but  discloses  a  valuable  analogy  between  Jewish  and  Greek <br/>symbolism. <br/><br/>p.  62 <br/><br/>an  automaton  which  moved  when  certain  stones  in  the  floor  of  the  vault  were  stepped  upon  by  an <br/>intruder.  At  that  time  the  Rosicrucian  controversy  was  at  its  height,  so  it  was  decided  that  the  tomb <br/>was  that  of  a  Rosicrucian  initiate.  A  countryman,  discovering  the  tomb  and  entering,  found  the <br/>interior  brilliantly  lighted  by  a  lamp  hanging  from  the  ceiling.  As  he  walked,  his  weight  depressed <br/>some  of  the  floor  stones.  At  once  a  seated  figure  in  heavy  armor  began  to  move.  Mechanically  it  rose <br/>to  its  feet  and  struck  the  lamp  with  an  iron  baton,  completely  destroying  it,  and  thus  effectually <br/>preventing  the  discovery  of  the  secret  substance  which  maintained  the  flame.  How  long  the  lamp  had <br/>burned  is  unknown,  but  certainly  it  had  been  for  a  considerable  number  of  years. <br/><br/>It  is  related  that  among  the  tombs  near  Memphis  and  in  the  Brahmin  temples  of  India  lights  have <br/>been  found  in  sealed  chambers  and  vessels,  but  sudden  exposure  to  the  air  has  extinguished  them  and <br/>caused  their  fuel  to  evaporate. <br/><br/>It  is  now  believed  that  the  wicks  of  these  perpetual  lamps  were  made  of  braided  or  woven  asbestos, <br/>called  by  the  alchemists  salamander's  wool,  and  that  the  fuel  was  one  of  the  products  of  alchemical <br/>research.  Kircher  attempted  to  extract  oil  from  asbestos,  being  convinced  that  as  the  substance  itself <br/>was  indestructible  by  fire  an  oil  extracted  from  it  would  supply  the  lamp  with  a  fuel  likewise <br/>indestructible.  After  spending  two  years  in  fruitless  experimental  work,  he  concluded  that  the  task <br/>was  impossible  of  accomplishment. <br/><br/>Several  formulae  for  the  making  of  the  fuel  for  the  lamps  have  been  preserved.  In  Isis  Unveiled,  H.  P. <br/>Blavatsky  reprints  two  of  these  formulee  from  early  authors&#x2014;Tritenheim  and  Bartolomeo  Korndorf. <br/>One  will  suffice  to  give  a  general  understanding  of  the  process: <br/><br/>&quot;Sulphur.  Alum  ust.  a  &#x25a1;  iv.;  sublime  them  into  flowers  to  &#x25a1;  ij.,  of  which  add  of  crystalline  Venetian <br/>borax  (powdered)  &#x25a1;  j.;  upon  these  affuse  high  rectified  spirit  of  wine  and  digest  it,  then  abstract  it <br/>and  pour  on  fresh;  repeat  this  so  often  till  the  sulphur  melts  like  wax  without  any  smoke,  upon  a  hot <br/>plate  of  brass:  this  is  for  the  pabulum,  but  the  wick  is  to  be  prepared  after  this  manner:  gather  the <br/>threads  or  thrums  of  the  Lapis  asbestos,  to  the  thickness  of  your  middle  and  the  length  of  your  little <br/>finger,  then  put  them  into  a  Venetian  glass,  and  covering  them  over  with  the  aforesaid  depurated <br/>sulphur  or  aliment  set  the  glass  in  sand  for  the  space  of  twenty-four  hours,  so  hot  that  the  sulphur <br/>may  bubble  all  the  while.  The  wick  being  thus  besmeared  and  anointed,  is  to  be  put  into  a  glass  like  a <br/>scallop-shell,  in  such  manner  that  some  part  of  it  may  lie  above  the  mass  of  prepared  sulphur;  then <br/>setting  this  glass  upon  hot  sand,  you  must  melt  the  sulphur,  so  that  it  may  lay  hold  of  the  wick,  and <br/>when  it  is  lighted,  it  will  burn  with  a  perpetual  flame  and  you  may  set  this  lamp  in  any  place  where <br/>you  please.&quot; <br/><br/>THE  GREEK  ORACLES <br/><br/>The  worship  of  Apollo  included  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  places  of  prophecy  by  means  of <br/>which  the  gods  could  communicate  with  mankind  and  reveal  futurity  to  such  as  deserved  the  boon. <br/>The  early  history  of  Greece  abounds  with  accounts  of  talking  trees,  rivers,  statues,  and  caves  in  which <br/>nymphs,  dryads,  or  dsemons  had  taken  up  their  abodes  and  from  which  they  delivered  oracles.  While <br/>Christian  authors  have  tried  to  prove  that  oracular  revelations  were  delivered  by  the  Devil  for  the <br/>purpose  of  misleading  humanity,  they  have  not  dared  to  attack  the  theory  of  oracles,  because  of  the <br/>repeated  reference  to  it  in  their  own  sacred  writings.  If  the  onyx  stones  on  the  shoulders  of  Israel's <br/>high  priest  made  known  by  their  flashings  the  will  of  Jehovah,  then  a  black  dove,  temporarily <br/>endowed  with  the  faculty  of  speech,  could  indeed  pronounce  oracles  in  the  temple  of  Jupiter  Ammon. <br/><br/><br/>If  the  witch  of  Endor  could  invoke  the  shade  of  Samuel,  who  in  turn  gave  prophecies  to  Saul,  could <br/>not  a  priestess  of  Apollo  call  up  the  specter  of  her  liege  to  foretell  the  destiny  of  Greece? <br/><br/>The  most  famous  oracles  of  antiquity  were  those  of  Delphi,  Dodona,  Trophonius,  and  Latona,  of <br/>which  the  talking  oak  trees  of  Dodona  were  the  oldest.  Though  it  is  impossible  to  trace  back  to  the <br/>genesis  of  the  theory  of  oracular  prophecy,  it  is  known  that  many  of  the  caves  and  fissures  set  aside  by <br/>the  Greeks  as  oracles  were  sacred  long  before  the  rise  of  Greek  culture. <br/><br/>The  oracle  of  Apollo  at  Delphi  remains  one  of  the  unsolved  mysteries  of  the  ancients.  Alexander <br/>Wilder  derives  the  name  Delphi  from  delphos,  the  womb.  This  name  was  chosen  by  the  Greeks  be <br/>cause  of  the  shape  of  the  cavern  and  the  vent  leading  into  the  depths  of  the  earth.  The  original  name <br/>of  the  oracle  was  Pytho,  so  called  because  its  chambers  had  been  the  abode  of  the  great  serpent <br/>Python,  a  fearsome  creature  that  had  crept  out  of  the  slime  left  by  the  receding  flood  that  had <br/>destroyed  all  human  beings  except  Deucalion  and  Pyrrha.  Apollo,  climbing  the  side  of  Mount <br/>Parnassus,  slew  the  serpent  after  a  prolonged  combat,  and  threw  the  body  down  the  fissure  of  the <br/>oracle.  From  that  time  the  Sun  God,  surnamed  the  Pythian  Apollo,  gave  oracles  from  the  vent.  With <br/>Dionysos  he  shared  the  honor  of  being  the  patron  god  of  Delphi. <br/><br/>After  being  vanquished  by  Apollo,  the  spirit  of  Python  remained  at  Delphi  as  the  representative  of  his <br/>conqueror,  and  it  was  with  the  aid  of  his  effluvium  that  the  priestess  was  able  to  become  en  rapport <br/>with  the  god.  The  fumes  rising  from  the  fissure  of  the  oracle  were  supposed  to  come  from  the <br/>decaying  body  of  Python.  The  name  Pythoness,  or  Pythia,  given  to  the  female  hierophant  of  the  oracle, <br/>means  literally  one  who  has  been  thrown  into  a  religious  frenzy  by  inhaling  fumes  rising  from <br/>decomposing  matter.  It  is  of  further  interest  to  note  that  the  Greeks  believed  the  oracle  of  Delphi  to <br/>be  the  umbilicus  of  the  earth,  thus  proving  that  they  considered  the  planet  an  immense  human  being. <br/>The  connection  between  the  principle  of  oracular  revelation  and  the  occult  significance  of  the  navel  is <br/>an  important  secret  belonging  to  the  ancient  Mysteries. <br/><br/>The  oracle,  however,  is  much  older  than  the  foregoing  account  indicates.  A  story  of  this  kind  was <br/>probably  invented  by  the  priests  to  explain  the  phenomena  to  those  inquisitive  persons  whom  they <br/>did  not  consider  worthy  of  enlightenment  regarding  the  true  esoteric  nature  of  the  oracle.  Some <br/>believe  that  the  Delphic  fissure  was  discovered  by  a  Hypoborean  priest,  but  as  far  back  as  recorded <br/>history  goes  the  cave  was  sacred,  and  persons  came  from  all  parts  of  Greece  and  the  surrounding <br/>countries  to  question  the  daemon  who  dwelt  in  its  chimney-like  vent.  Priests  and  priestesses  guarded <br/>it  closely  and  served  the  spirit  who  dwelt  therein  and  who  enlightened  humanity  through  the  gift  of <br/>propheq'^. <br/><br/>The  story  of  the  original  discovery  of  the  oracle  is  somewhat  as  follows:  Shepherds  tending  their <br/>flocks  on  the  side  of  Mount  Parnassus  were  amazed  at  the  peculiar  antics  of  goats  that  wandered  close <br/>to  a  great  chasm  on  its  southwestern  spur.  The  animals  jumped  about  as  though  trying  to  dance,  and <br/>emitted  strange  cries  unlike  anything  before  heard.  At  last  one  of  the  shepherds,  curious  to  learn  the <br/>cause  of  the  phenomenon,  approached  the  vent,  from  which  were  rising  noxious  fumes.  Immediately <br/>he  was  seized  with  a  prophetic  ecstasy;  he  danced  with  wild  abandon,  sang,  jabbered  inarticulate <br/>sounds,  and  foretold  future  events.  Others  went  close  to  the  fissure,  with  the  same  result.  The  fame  of <br/>the  place  spread,  and  many  came  to  learn  of  the  future  by  inhaling  the  mephitic  fumes,  which <br/>exhilarated  to  the  verge  of  delirium. <br/><br/>Some  of  those  who  came,  being  unable  to  control  themselves,  and  having  temporarily  the  strength  of <br/>madmen,  tore  themselves  from  those  seeking  to  restrain  them,  and,  jumping  into  the  vent,  perished. <br/>In  order  to  prevent  others  from  doing  likewise,  a  wall  was  erected  around  the  fissure  and  a  prophetess <br/>was  appointed  to  act  as  mediator  between  the  oracle  and  those  who  came  to  question  it.  According  to <br/>later  authorities,  a  tripod  of  gold,  ornamented  with  carvings  of  Apollo  in  the  form  of  Python,  the  great <br/>serpent,  was  placed  over  the  cleft,  and  on  this  was  arranged  a  specially  prepared  seat,  so  constructed <br/><br/><br/>that  a  person  would  have  difficulty  in  falling  off  while  under  the  influence  of  the  oracular  fumes,  just <br/>before  this  time,  a  story  had  been  circulated  that  the  fumes  of  the  oracle  arose  from  the  decaying  body <br/>of  Python.  It  is  possible  that  the  oracle  revealed  its  own  origin. <br/><br/>For  many  centuries  during  its  early  history,  virgin  maidens  were  consecrated  to  the  service  of  the <br/>oracle.  They  were  called  the  Phoebades,  or  Pythige,  and  constituted  that  famous  order  now  known  as <br/>the  Pythian  priesthood.  It  is  probable  that  women  were  chosen  to  receive  the  oracles  because  their <br/>sensitive  and  emotional  nature  responded <br/><br/><br/>THE  PYTHIAN  APOLLO. <br/><br/><br/>From  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>Apollo,  the  twin  brother  of  Diana,  was  the  son  of  Jupiter  and  Latona.  Apollo  was  fully  adult  at  the  time  of  his  birth.  He  was <br/>considered  to  be  the  first  physician  and  the  inventor  of  music  and  song.  The  Greeks  also  acclaimed  him  to  be  father  of  the <br/>bow  and  arrow.  The  famous  temple  of  Apollo  at  Delphi  was  rebuilt  five  times.  The  first  temple  was  formed  only  of  laurel <br/>branches;  the  second  was  somewhat  similar;  the  third  was  brass  and  the  fourth  and  fifth  were  probably  of  marble,  of <br/>considerable  size  and  great  beauty.  No  other  oracle  in  Greece  equaled  in  magnificence  that  of  Delphi  in  the  zenith  of  its <br/>power.  Writers  declared  that  it  contained  many  statues  of  solid  gold  and  silver,  marvelous  ornaments,  and  implements  of <br/>the  most  valuable  materials  and  beautiful  workmanship,  donated  by  princes  and  kings  who  came  from  all  parts  of  the <br/>civilized  world  to  consult  the  spirit  of  Apollo  dwelling  in  this  sanctuary. <br/><br/>p-63 <br/><br/>more  quickly  and  completely  to  &quot;the  fumes  of  enthusiasm.&quot;  Three  days  before  the  time  set  to  receive <br/>the  communications  from  Apollo,  the  virgin  priestess  began  the  ceremony  of  purification.  She  bathed <br/>in  the  Castalian  well,  abstained  from  all  food,  drank  only  from  the  fountain  of  Cassotis,  which  was <br/>brought  into  the  temple  through  concealed  pipes,  and  just  before  mounting  the  tripod,  she  chewed  a <br/>few  leaves  of  the  sacred  bay  tree.  It  has  been  said  that  the  water  was  drugged  to  bring  on  distorted <br/>visions,  or  the  priests  of  Delphi  were  able  to  manufacture  an  exhilarating  and  intoxicating  gas,  which <br/>they  conducted  by  subterranean  ducts  and  released  into  the  shaft  of  the  oracle  several  feet  below  the <br/>surface.  Neither  of  these  theories  has  been  proved,  however,  nor  does  either  in  anyway  explain  the <br/>accuracy  of  the  predictions. <br/><br/><br/>When  the  young  prophetess  had  completed  the  process  of  purification,  she  was  clothed  in  sanctified <br/>raiment  and  led  to  the  tripod,  upon  which  she  seated  herself,  surrounded  by  the  noxious  vapors  rising <br/>from  the  yawning  fissure.  Gradually,  as  she  inhaled  the  fumes,  a  change  came  over  her.  It  was  as  if  a <br/>different  spirit  had  entered  her  body.  She  struggled,  tore  her  clothing,  and  uttered  inarticulate  cries. <br/>After  a  time  her  struggles  ceased.  Upon  becoming  calm  a  great  majesty  seemed  to  posses  her,  and <br/>with  eyes  fixed  on  space  and  body  rigid,  she  uttered  the  prophetic  words.  The  predictions  were <br/>usually  in  the  form  of  hexameter  verse,  but  the  words  were  often  ambiguous  and  sometimes <br/>unintelligible.  Every  sound  that  she  made,  every  motion  of  her  body,  was  carefully  recorded  by  the <br/>five  Hosii,  or  holy  men,  who  were  appointed  as  scribes  to  preserve  the  minutest  details  of  each <br/>divination.  The  Hosii  were  appointed  for  life,  and  were  chosen  from  the  direct  descendants  of <br/>Deucalion. <br/><br/>After  the  oracle  was  delivered,  the  Pjithia  began  to  struggle  again,  and  the  spirit  released  her.  She  was <br/>then  carried  or  supported  to  a  chamber  of  rest,  where  she  remained  till  the  nervous  ecstasy  had <br/>passed  away. <br/><br/>lamblichus,  in  his  dissertation  on  The  Mysteries,  describes  how  the  spirit  of  the  oracle~a  fiery <br/>daemon,  even  Apollo  himself &#x2014;took  control  of  the  Pythoness  and  manifested  through  her:  &quot;But  the <br/>prophetess  in  Delphi,  whether  she  gives  oracles  to  mankind  through  an  attenuated  and  fiery  spirit, <br/>bursting  from  the  mouth  of  the  cavern;  or  whether  being  seated  in  the  adytum  on  a  brazen  tripod,  or <br/>on  a  stool  with  four  feet,  she  becomes  sacred  to  the  God;  whichsoever  of  these  is  the  case,  she  entirely <br/>gives  herself  up  to  a  divine  spirit,  and  is  illuminated  with  a  ray  of  divine  fire.  And  when,  indeed,  fire <br/>ascending  from  the  mouth  of  the  cavern  circularly  invests  her  in  collected  abundance,  she  becomes <br/>filled  from  it  with  a  divine  splendour.  But  when  she  places  herself  on  the  seat  of  the  God,  she  becomes <br/>co-adapted  to  his  stable  prophetic  power:  and  from  both  of  these  preparatory  operations  she  becomes <br/>wholly  possessed  by  the  God.  And  then,  indeed,  he  is  present  with  and  illuminates  her  in  a  separate <br/>manner,  and  is  different  from  the  lire,  the  spirit,  the  proper  seat,  and,  in  short,  from  all  the  visible <br/>apparatus  of  the  place,  whether  physical  or  sacred.&quot; <br/><br/>Among  the  celebrities  who  visited  the  oracle  of  Delphi  were  the  immortal  Apollonius  of  Tyana  and  his <br/>disciple  Damis.  He  made  his  offerings  and,  after  being  crowned  with  a  laurel  wreath  and  given  a <br/>branch  of  the  same  plant  to  carry  in  his  hand,  he  passed  behind  the  statue  of  Apollo  which  stood <br/>before  the  entrance  to  the  cave,  and  descended  into  the  sacred  place  of  the  oracle.  The  priestess  was <br/>also  crowned  with  laurel  and  her  head  bound  with  a  band  of  white  wool.  Apollonius  asked  the  oracle <br/>if  his  name  would  be  remembered  by  future  generations.  The  Pythoness  answered  in  the  affirmative, <br/>but  declared  that  it  would  always  be  calumniated.  Apollonius  left  the  cavern  in  anger,  but  time  has <br/>proved  the  accuracy  of  the  prediction,  for  the  early  church  fathers  perpetuated  the  name  of <br/>Apollonius  as  the  Antichrist.  (For  details  of  the  story  see  Histoire  de  la  Magie.) <br/><br/>The  messages  given  by  the  virgin  prophetess  were  turned  over  to  the  philosophers  of  the  oracle, <br/>whose  duty  it  was  to  interpret  and  apply  them.  The  communications  were  then  delivered  to  the  poets, <br/>who  immediately  translated  them  into  odes  and  lyrics,  setting  forth  in  exquisite  form  the  statements <br/>supposedly  made  by  Apollo  and  making  them  available  for  the  populace. <br/><br/>Serpents  were  much  in  evidence  at  the  oracle  of  Delphi.  The  base  of  the  tripod  upon  which  the  Pythia <br/>sat  was  formed  of  the  twisted  bodies  of  three  gigantic  snakes.  According  to  some  authorities,  one  of <br/>the  processes  used  to  produce  the  prophetic  ecstasy  was  to  force  the  young  priestess  to  gaze  into  the <br/>eyes  of  a  serpent.  Fascinated  and  hypnotized,  she  then  spoke  with  the  voice  of  the  god. <br/><br/>Although  the  early  Pythian  priestesses  were  always  maidens&#x2014;some  still  in  their  teens&#x2014;a  law  was  later <br/>enacted  that  only  women  past  fifty  years  of  age  should  be  the  mouthpiece  of  the  oracle.  These  older <br/>women  dressed  as  young  girls  and  went  through  the  same  ceremonial  as  the  first  Pjithiae.  The  change <br/><br/><br/>was  probably  the  indirect  result  of  a  series  of  assaults  made  upon  the  persons  of  the  priestesses  by  the <br/>profane. <br/><br/>During  the  early  history  of  the  Delphian  oracle  the  god  spoke  only  at  each  seventh  birthday  of  Apollo. <br/>As  time  went  on,  however,  the  demand  became  so  great  that  the  Pjithia  was  forced  to  seat  herself <br/>upon  the  tripod  every  month.  The  times  selected  for  the  consultation  and  the  questions  to  be  asked <br/>were  determined  by  lot  or  by  vote  of  the  inhabitants  of  Delphi. <br/><br/>It  is  generally  admitted  that  the  effect  of  the  Delphian  oracle  upon  Greek  culture  was  profoundly <br/>constructive.  James  Gardner  sums  up  its  influence  in  the  following  words:  &quot;It  responses  revealed <br/>many  a  tyrant  and  foretold  his  fate.  Through  its  means  many  an  unhappy  being  was  saved  from <br/>destruction  and  many  a  perplexed  mortal  guided  in  the  right  way.  It  encouraged  useful  institutions, <br/>and  promoted  the  progress  of  useful  discoveries.  Its  moral  influence  was  on  the  side  of  virtue,  and  its <br/>political  influence  in  favor  of  the  advancement  of  civil  liberty.&quot;  (See  The  Faiths  of  The  World.) <br/><br/>The  oracle  of  Dodona  was  presided  over  by  Jupiter,  who  uttered  prophecies  through  oak  trees,  birds, <br/>and  vases  of  brass.  Many  writers  have  noted  the  similarities  between  the  rituals  of  Dodona  and  those <br/>of  the  Druid  priests  of  Britain  and  Gaul.  The  famous  oracular  dove  of  Dodona,  alighting  upon  the <br/>branches  of  the  sacred  oaks,  not  only  discoursed  at  length  in  the  Greek  tongue  upon  philosophy  and <br/>religion,  but  also  answered  the  queries  of  those  who  came  from  distant  places  to  consult  it. <br/><br/>The  &quot;talking&quot;  trees  stood  together,  forming  a  sacred  grove.  When  the  priests  desired  answers  to <br/>important  questions,  after  careful  and  solemn  purifications  they  retired  to  the  grove.  They  then <br/>accosted  the  trees,  beseeching  a  reply  from  the  god  who  dwelt  therein.  When  they  had  stated  their <br/>questions,  the  trees  spoke  with  the  voices  of  human  beings,  revealing  to  the  priests  the  desired <br/>information.  Some  assert  that  there  was  but  one  tree  which  spoke&#x2014;an  oak  or  a  beech  standing  in  the <br/>very  heart  of  the  ancient  grove.  Because  Jupiter  was  believed  to  inhabit  this  tree  he  was  sometimes <br/>called  Phegonaeus,  or  one  who  lives  in  a  beech  tree. <br/><br/>Most  curious  of  the  oracles  of  Dodona  were  the  &quot;talking&quot;  vases,  or  kettles.  These  were  made  of  brass <br/>and  so  carefully  fashioned  that  when  struck  they  gave  off  sound  for  hours.  Some  writers  have <br/>described  a  row  of  these  vases  and  have  declared  that  if  one  of  them  was  struck  its  vibrations  would <br/>be  communicated  to  all  the  others  and  a  terrifying  din  ensue.  Other  authors  describe  a  large  single <br/>vase,  standing  upon  a  pillar,  near  which  stood  another  column,  supporting  the  statue  of  a  child <br/>holding  a  whip.  At  the  end  of  the  whip  were  a  number  of  swinging  cords  tipped  with  small  metal  balls, <br/>and  the  wind,  which  blew  incessantly  through  the  open  building,  caused  the  balls  to  strike  against  the <br/>vase.  The  number  and  intensity  of  the  impacts  and  the  reverberations  of  the  vase  were  all  carefully <br/>noted,  and  the  priests  delivered  their  oracles  accordingly. <br/><br/>When  the  original  priests  of  Dodona~the  5e//o2~mysteriously  vanished,  the  oracle  was  served  for <br/>many  centuries  by  three  priestesses  who  interpreted  the  vases  and  at  midnight  interrogated  the <br/>sacred  trees.  The  patrons  of  the  oracles  were  expected  to  bring  offerings  and  to  make  contributions. <br/><br/>Another  remarkable  oracle  was  the  Cave  of  Trophonius,  which  stood  upon  the  side  of  a  hill  with  an <br/>entrance  so  small  that  it  seemed  impossible  for  a  human  being  to  enter.  After  the  consultant  had <br/>made  his  offering  at  the  statue  of  Trophonius  and  had  donned  the  sanctified  garments,  he  climbed  the <br/>hill  to  the  cave,  carrying  in  one  hand  a  cake  of  honey.  Sitting  down  at  the  edge  of  the  opening,  he <br/>lowered  his  feet  into  the  cavern.  Thereupon  his  entire  body  was  precipitately <br/><br/><br/>THE  DODONEAN  JUPITER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>Jupiter  was  called  Dodonean  after  the  city  of  Dodona  in  Epirus.  Near  this  city  was  a  hill  thickly  covered  with  oak  trees <br/>which  from  the  most  ancient  times  had  been  sacred  to  Jupiter.  The  grove  was  further  venerated  because  dryads,  fauns, <br/>satyrs,  and  nymphs  were  believed  to  dwell  in  its  depths.  From  the  ancient  oaks  and  beeches  were  hung  many  chains  of <br/>tiny  bronze  bells  which  tinkled  day  and  night  as  the  wind  swayed  the  branches.  Some  assert  that  the  celebrated  talking <br/>dove  of  Dodona  was  in  reality  a  woman,  because  in  Thessaly  both  prophetesses  and  doves  were  called  Peleiadas.  It  is <br/>supposed  that  the  first  temple  of  Dodona  was  erected  by  Deucalion  and  those  who  survived  the  great  flood  with  him.  For <br/>this  reason  the  oracle  at  Dodona  was  considered  the  oldest  in  Greece. <br/><br/>p.  64 <br/><br/>drawn  into  the  cave,  which  was  described  by  those  who  had  entered  it  as  having  only  the  dimensions <br/>of  a  fair-sized  oven.  When  the  oracle  had  completed  its  revelation,  the  consultant,  usually  delirious, <br/>was  forcibly  ejected  from  the  cave,  feet  foremost. <br/><br/>Near  the  cave  of  the  oracle  two  fountains  bubbled  out  of  the  earth  within  a  few  feet  of  each  other. <br/>Those  about  to  enter  the  cave  drank  first  from  these  fountains,  the  waters  of  which  seemed  to  possess <br/>peculiar  occult  properties.  The  first  contained  the  water  of  forgetfulness,  and  all  who  drank  thereof <br/>forgot  their  earthly  sorrows.  From  the  second  fountain  flowed  the  sacred  water  of  Mnemosyne,  or <br/>remembrance,  for  later  it  enabled  those  who  partook  of  it  to  recall  their  experiences  while  in  the  cave. <br/><br/>Though  its  entrance  was  marked  by  two  brass  obelisks,  the  cave,  surrounded  by  a  wall  of  white  stones <br/>and  concealed  in  the  heart  of  a  grove  of  sacred  trees,  did  not  present  an  imposing  appearance.  There <br/>is  no  doubt  that  those  entering  it  passed  through  strange  experiences,  for  they  were  obliged  to  leave  at <br/>the  adjacent  temple  a  complete  account  of  what  they  saw  and  heard  while  in  the  oracle.  The <br/>prophecies  were  given  in  the  form  of  dreams  and  visions,  and  were  accompanied  by  severe  pains  in <br/>the  head;  some  never  completely  recovered  from  the  after  effects  of  their  delirium.  The  confused <br/>recital  of  their  experiences  was  interpreted  by  the  priests  according  to  the  question  to  be  answered. <br/>While  the  priests  probably  used  some  unknown  herb  to  produce  the  dreams  or  visions  of  the  cavern, <br/>their  skill  in  interpreting  them  bordered  on  the  Supernatural.  Before  consulting  the  oracle,  it  was <br/><br/><br/>necessary  to  offer  a  ram  to  the  daemon  of  the  cave,  and  the  priest  decided  by  hieromanqr  whether  the <br/>time  chosen  was  propitious  and  the  sacrifice  was  satisfactory. <br/><br/>THE  SEVEN  WONDERS  OF  THE  WORLD <br/><br/>Many  of  the  sculptors  and  architects  of  the  ancient  world  were  initiates  of  the  Mysteries,  particularly <br/>the  Eleusinian  rites.  Since  the  dawn  of  time,  the  truers  of  stone  and  the  hewers  of  wood  have <br/>constituted  a  divinely  overshadowed  caste.  As  civilization  spread  slowly  over  the  earth,  cities  were <br/>built  and  deserted;  monuments  were  erected  to  heroes  at  present  unknown;  temples  were  built  to <br/>gods  who  lie  broken  in  the  dust  of  the  nations  they  inspired.  Research  has  proved  not  only  that  the <br/>builders  of  these  cities  and  monuments  and  the  sculptors  who  chiseled  out  the  inscrutable  faces  of  the <br/>gods  were  masters  of  their  crafts,  but  that  in  the  world  today  there  are  none  to  equal  them.  The <br/>profound  knowledge  of  mathematics  and  astronomy  embodied  in  ancient  architecture,  and  the <br/>equally  profound  knowledge  of  anatomy  revealed  in  Greek  statuary,  prove  that  the  fashioners  of  both <br/>were  master  minds,  deeply  cultured  in  the  wisdom  which  constituted  the  arcana  of  the <br/>Mysteries  .Thus  was  established  the  Guild  of  the  Builders,  progenitors  of  modern  Freemasons.  When <br/>employed  to  build  palaces,  temples  or  combs,  or  to  carve  statues  for  the  wealthy,  those  initiated <br/>architects  and  artists  concealed  in  their  works  the  secret  doctrine,  so  that  now,  long  after  their  bones <br/>have  returned  to  dust,  the  world  realizes  that  those  first  artisans  were  indeed  duly  initiated  and <br/>worthy  to  receive  the  wages  of  Master  Masons. <br/><br/>The  Seven  Wonders  of  the  World,  while  apparently  designed  for  divers  reasons,  were  really <br/>monuments  erected  to  perpetuate  the  arcana  of  the  Mysteries.  They  were  symbolic  structures,  placed <br/>in  peculiar  spots,  and  the  real  purpose  of  their  erection  can  be  sensed  only  by  the  initiated.  Eliphas <br/>Levi  has  noted  the  marked  correspondence  between  these  Seven  Wonders  and  the  seven  planets.  The <br/>Seven  Wonders  of  the  World  were  built  by  Widow's  sons  in  honor  of  the  seven  planetary  genii.  Their <br/>secret  symbolism  is  identical  with  that  of  the  seven  seals  of  Revelation  and  the  seven  churches  of  Asia. <br/><br/>1.  The  Colossus  of  Rhodes,  a  gigantic  brass  statue  about  109  feet  in  height  and  requiring  over  twelve <br/>years  to  build,  was  the  work  of  an  initiated  artist.  Chares  of  Lindus.  The  popular  theory&#x2014;accepted  for <br/>several  hundred  years&#x2014;that  the  figure  stood  with  one  foot  on  each  side  of  the  entrance  to  the  harbor <br/>of  Rhodes  and  that  full-rigged  ships  passed  between  its  feet,  has  never  been  substantiated. <br/>Unfortunately,  the  figure  remained  standing  but  fifty-six  years,  being  thrown  down  by  an  earthquake <br/>in  224  B.C.  The  shattered  parts  of  the  Colossus  lay  scattered  about  the  ground  for  more  than  900 <br/>years,  when  they  were  finally  sold  to  a  Jewish  merchant,  who  carried  the  metal  away  on  the  backs  of <br/>700  camels.  Some  believed  that  the  brass  was  converted  into  munitions  and  others  that  it  was  made <br/>into  drainage  pipes.  This  gigantic  gilded  figure,  with  its  crown  of  solar  rays  and  its  upraised  torch, <br/>signified  occultly  the  glorious  Sun  Man  of  the  Mysteries,  the  Universal  Savior. <br/><br/>2.  The  architect  Ctesiphon,  in  the  fifth  century  B.C.,  submitted  to  the  Ionian  cities  a  plan  for  erecting <br/>a  joint  monument  to  their  patron  goddess,  Diana.  The  place  chosen  was  Ephesus,  a  city  south  of <br/>Smyrna.  The  building  was  constructed  of  marble.  The  roof  was  supported  by  127  columns,  each  60 <br/>feet  high  and  weighing  over  150  tons.  The  temple  was  destroyed  by  black  magic  about  356  B.C.,  but <br/>the  world  fixes  the  odious  crime  upon  the  tool  by  means  of  which  the  destruction  was  accomplished&#x2014; <br/>a  mentally  deranged  man  named  Herostratus.  It  was  later  rebuilt,  but  the  symbolism  was  lost.  The <br/>original  temple,  designed  as  a  miniature  of  the  universe,  was  dedicated  to  the  moon,  the  occult <br/>symbol  of  generation. <br/><br/>3.  Upon  his  exile  from  Athens,  Phidias&#x2014; the  greatest  of  all  the  Greek  sculptors&#x2014; went  to  Olympia  in  the <br/>province  of  Elis  and  there  designed  his  colossal  statue  of  Zeus,  chief  of  the  gods  of  Greece.  There  is <br/>not  even  an  accurate  description  of  this  masterpiece  now  in  existence;  only  a  few  old  coins  give  an <br/>inadequate  idea  of  its  general  appearance.  The  body  of  the  god  was  overlaid  with  ivory  and  the  robes <br/>were  of  beaten  gold.  In  one  hand  he  is  supposed  to  have  held  a  globe  supporting  a  figure  of  the <br/><br/><br/>Goddess  of  Victory,  in  the  other  a  scepter  surmounted  by  an  eagle.  The  head  of  Zeus  was  archaic, <br/>heavily  bearded,  and  crowned  with  an  olive  wreath.  The  statue  was  seated  upon  an  elaborately <br/>decorated  throne.  As  its  name  implies,  the  monument  was  dedicated  to  the  spirit  of  the  planet <br/>Jupiter,~one  of  the  seven  Logi  who  bow  before  the  Lord  of  the  Sun. <br/><br/>4.  Eliphas  Levi  includes  the  Temple  of  Solomon  among  the  Seven  Wonders  of  the  World,  giving  it  the <br/>place  occupied  by  the  Pharos,  or  Lighthouse,  of  Alexandria.  The  Pharos,  named  for  the  island  upon <br/>which  it  stood,  was  designed  and  constructed  by  Sostratus  of  Cnidus  during  the  reign  of  Ptolemy <br/>(283-247  B.C.).  It  is  described  as  being  of  white  marble  and  over  600  feet  high.  Even  in  that  ancient <br/>day  it  cost  nearly  a  million  dollars.  Fires  were  lighted  in  the  top  of  it  and  could  be  seen  for  miles  out  at <br/>sea.  It  was  destroyed  by  an  earthquake  in  the  thirteenth  century,  but  remains  of  it  were  visible  until <br/><br/>A.  D.  1350.  Being  the  tallest  of  all  the  Wonders,  it:  was  naturally  assigned  to  Saturn,  the  Father  of  the <br/>gods  and  the  true  illuminator  of  all  humanity. <br/><br/>5.  The  Mausoleum  at  Halicarnassus  was  a  magnificent  monument  erected  by  Queen  Artemisia  in <br/>memory  of  her  dead  husband.  King  Mausolus,  from  whose  name  the  word  mausoleum  is  derived.  The <br/>designers  of  the  building  were  Satyrus  and  P5l;his,  and  four  great  sculptors  were  employed  to <br/>ornament  the  edifice.  The  building,  which  was  114  feet  long  and  92  feet  wide,  was  divided  into  five <br/>major  sections  (the  senses)  and  surmounted  by  a  pyramid  (the  spiritual  nature  of  man).  The  pyramid <br/>rose  in  24  steps  (a  sacred  number),  and  upon  the  apex  was  a  statue  of  King  Mausolus  in  a  chariot.  His <br/>figure  was  9  feet  9V2  inches  tall.  Many  attempts  have  been  made  to  reconstruct  the  monument,  which, <br/>was  destroyed  by  an  earthquake,  but  none  has  been  altogether  successful.  This  monument  was  sacred <br/>to  the  planet  Mars  and  was  built  by  an  initiate  for  the  enlightenment  of  the  world. <br/><br/>6.  The  Gardens  of  Semiramis  at  Babylon&#x2014;more  commonly  known  as  the  Hanging  Gardens&#x2014;stood <br/>within  the  palace  grounds  of  Nebuchadnezzar,  near  the  Euphrates  River.  They  rose  in  a  terrace-like <br/><br/>pyramid  and  on  the  top  was  a  reservoir  for  the  watering  of  the  gardens.  They  were  built  about  600 <br/><br/>B.  C.,  but  the  name  of  the  landscape  artist  has  not  been  preserved.  They  symbolized  the  planes  of  the <br/>invisible  world,  and  were  consecrated  to  Venus  as  the  goddess  of  love  and  beauty. <br/><br/>7.  The  Great  Pyramid  was  supreme  among  the  temples  of  the  Mysteries.  In  order  to  be  true  to  its <br/>astronomical  symbolism,  it  must  have  been  constructed  about  70,000  years  ago.  It  was  the  tomb  of <br/>Osiris,  and  was  believed  to  have  been  built  by  the  gods  themselves,  and  the  architect  may  have  been <br/>the  immortal  Hermes.  It  is  the  monument  of  Mercury,  the  messenger  of  the  gods,  and  the  universal <br/>symbol  of  wisdom  and  letters. <br/><br/><br/>TROPHONIUS  OF  LEBADIA. <br/><br/><br/>from  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>Trophonius  and  his  brother  Agamedes  were  famous  architects.  While  building  a  certain  treasure  vault,  they  contrived  to <br/>leave  one  stone  movable  so  that  they  might  secretly  enter  and  steal  the  valuables  stored  there.  A  trap  was  set  by  the  owner, <br/>who  had  discovered  the  plot,  and  Agamedes  was  caught.  To  prevent  discovery,  Trophonius  decapitated  his  brother  and <br/>fled,  hotly  pursued.  He  hid  in  the  grove  of  Lebadia,  where  the  earth  opened  and  swallowed  him  up.  The  spirit  of <br/>Trophonius  thereafter  delivered  oracles  in  the  grove  and  its  caverns.  The  name  Trophonius  means  &quot;to  be  agitated,  excited, <br/>or  roiled.&quot;  It  was  declared  that  the  terrible  experiences  through  which  consultants  passed  in  the  oracular  caverns  so <br/>affected  them  that  they  never  smiled  again.  The  bees  which  accompany  the  figure  of  Trophonius  were  sacred  because  they <br/>led  the  first  envoys  from  Boetia  to  the  site  of  the  oracle.  The  figure  above  is  said  to  be  a  production  of  a  statue  of <br/>Trophonius  which  was  placed  on  the  brow  of  the  hill  above  the  oracle  and  surrounded  with  sharply  pointed  stakes  that  it <br/>could  not  be  touched. <br/><br/><br/>p-65 <br/><br/>The  Life  and  Philosophy  of  Pythagoras <br/><br/>WHILE  Mnesarchus,  the  father  of  Pythagoras,  was  in  the  city  of  Delphi  on  matters  pertaining  to  his <br/>business  as  a  merchant,  he  and  his  wife,  Parthenis,  decided  to  consult  the  oracle  of  Delphi  as  to <br/>whether  the  Fates  were  favorable  for  their  return  voyage  to  Syria.  When  the  Pythoness  (prophetess  of <br/>Apollo)  seated  herself  on  the  golden  tripod  over  the  yawning  vent  of  the  oracle,  she  did  not  answer  the <br/>question  they  had  asked,  but  told  Mnesarchus  that  his  wife  was  then  with  child  and  would  give  birth <br/>to  a  son  who  was  destined  to  surpass  all  men  in  beauty  and  wisdom,  and  who  throughout  the  course <br/>of  his  life  would  contribute  much  to  the  benefit  of  mankind.  Mnesarchus  was  so  deeply  impressed  by <br/>the  prophecy  that  he  changed  his  wife's  name  to  Pythasis,  in  honor  of  the  Pythian  priestess.  When  the <br/>child  was  born  at  Sidon  in  Phoenicia,  it  was&#x2014;as  the  oracle  had  said~a  son.  Mnesarchus  and  Pythasis <br/>named  the  child  Pythagoras,  for  they  believed  that  he  had  been  predestined  by  the  oracle. <br/><br/>Many  strange  legends  have  been  preserved  concerning  the  birth  of  Pythagoras.  Some  maintained  that <br/>he  was  no  mortal  man:  that  he  was  one  of  the  gods  who  had  taken  a  human  body  to  enable  him  to <br/>come  into  the  world  and  instruct  the  human  race.  Pythagoras  was  one  of  the  many  sages  and  saviors <br/>of  antiquity  for  whom  an  immaculate  conception  is  asserted.  In  his  Anacalypsis,  Godfrey  Higgins <br/>writes:  &quot;The  first  striking  circumstance  in  which  the  history  of  Pythagoras  agrees  with  the  history  of <br/>Jesus  is,  that  they  were  natives  of  nearly  the  same  country;  the  former  being  born  at  Sidon,  the  latter <br/>at  Bethlehem,  both  in  Syria.  The  father  of  Pythagoras,  as  well  as  the  father  of  Jesus,  was  prophetically <br/>informed  that  his  wife  should  bring  forth  a  son,  who  should  be  a  benefactor  to  mankind.  They  were <br/>both  born  when  their  mothers  were  from  home  on  journeys,  Joseph  and  his  wife  having  gone  up  to <br/>Bethlehem  to  be  taxed,  and  the  father  of  Pythagoras  having  travelled  from  Samos,  his  residence,  to <br/>Sidon,  about  his  mercantile  concerns.  Pythais  [Pythasis],  the  mother  of  Pythagoras,  had  a  connexion <br/>with  an  ApoUoniacal  spectre,  or  ghost,  of  the  God  Apollo,  or  God  Sol,  (of  course  this  must  have  been  a <br/>holy  ghost,  and  here  we  have  the  Holy  Ghost)  which  afterward  appeared  to  her  husband,  and  told  him <br/>that  he  must  have  no  connexion  with  his  wife  during  her  pregnancy&#x2014;a  story  evidently  the  same  as <br/>that  relating  to  Joseph  and  Mary.  From  these  peculiar  circumstances,  Pythagoras  was  known  by  the <br/>same  title  as  Jesus,  namely,  the  son  of  God;  and  was  supposed  by  the  multitude  to  be  under  the <br/>influence  of  Divine  inspiration.&quot; <br/><br/>This  most  famous  philosopher  was  born  sometime  between  600  and  590  B.C.,  and  the  length  of  his <br/>life  has  been  estimated  at  nearly  one  hundred  years. <br/><br/>The  teachings  of  Pythagoras  indicate  that  he  was  thoroughly  conversant  with  the  precepts  of  Oriental <br/>and  Occidental  esotericism.  He  traveled  among  the  Jews  and  was  instructed  by  the  Rabbins <br/>concerning  the  secret  traditions  of  Moses,  the  lawgiver  of  Israel.  Later  the  School  of  the  Essenes  was <br/>conducted  chiefly  for  the  purpose  of  interpreting  the  Pythagorean  symbols.  Pythagoras  was  initiated <br/>into  the  Egyptian,  Babylonian,  and  Chaldean  Mysteries.  Although  it  is  believed  by  some  that  he  was  a <br/>disciple  of  Zoroaster,  it  is  doubtful  whether  his  instructor  of  that  name  was  the  God-man  now  revered <br/>by  the  Parsees.  While  accounts  of  his  travels  differ,  historians  agree  that  he  visited  many  countries <br/>and  studied  at  the  feet  of  many  masters. <br/><br/>&quot;After  having  acquired  all  which  it  was  possible  for  him  to  learn  of  the  Greek  philosophers  and, <br/>presumably,  become  an  initiate  in  the  Eleusinian  mysteries,  he  went  to  Egypt,  and  after  many  rebuffs <br/>and  refusals,  finally  succeeded  in  securing  initiation  in  the  Mysteries  of  Isis,  at  the  hands  of  the <br/>priests  of  Thebes.  Then  this  intrepid  'joiner'  wended  his  way  into  Phoenicia  and  Syria  where  the <br/>Mysteries  of  Adonis  were  conferred  upon  him,  and  crossing  to  the  valley  of  the  Euphrates  he  tarried <br/>long  enough  to  become  versed  in,  the  secret  lore  of  the  Chaldeans,  who  still  dwelt  in  the  vicinity  of <br/>Babylon.  Finally,  he  made  his  greatest  and  most  historic  venture  through  Media  and  Persia  into <br/><br/><br/>Hindustan  where  he  remained  several  years  as  a  pupil  and  initiate  of  the  learned  Brahmins  of <br/><br/>Elephanta  and  Ellora.&quot;  (See  Ancient  Freemasonry,  by  Frank  C.  Higgins,  32&#x00b0;.)  The  same  author  adds <br/>that  the  name  of  Pythagoras  is  still  preserved  in  the  records  of  the  Brahmins  as  Yavancharya,  the <br/>Ionian  Teacher. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  was  said  to  have  been  the  first  man  to  call  himself  a  philosopher;  in  fact,  the  world  is <br/>indebted  to  him  for  the  word  philosopher.  Before  that  time  the  wise  men  had  called  themselves  sages, <br/>which  was  interpreted  to  mean  those  who  know.  Pythagoras  was  more  modest.  He  coined  the  word <br/>philosopher,  which  he  defined  as  one  who  is  attempting  to  find  out. <br/><br/>After  returning  from  his  wanderings,  Pythagoras  established  a  school,  or  as  it  has  been  sometimes <br/>called,  a  university,  at  Crotona,  a  Dorian  colony  in  Southern  Italy.  Upon  his  arrival  at  Crotona  he  was <br/>regarded  askance,  but  after  a  short  time  those  holding  important  positions  in  the  surrounding <br/>colonies  sought  his  counsel  in  matters  of  great  moment.  He  gathered  around  him  a  small  group  of <br/>sincere  disciples  whom  he  instructed  in  the  secret  wisdom  which  had  been  revealed  to  him,  and  also <br/>in  the  fundamentals  of  occult  mathematics,  music,  and  astronomy,  which  he  considered  to  be  the <br/>triangular  foundation  of  all  the  arts  and  sciences. <br/><br/>When  he  was  about  sixty  years  old,  Pythagoras  married  one  of  his  disciples,  and  seven  children <br/>resulted  from  the  union.  His  wife  was  a  remarkably  able  woman,  who  not  only  inspired  him  during <br/>the  years  of  his  life  but  after  his  assassination  continued  to  promulgate  his  doctrines. <br/><br/>As  is  so  often  the  case  with  genius,  Pythagoras  by  his  outspokenness  incurred  both  political  and <br/>personal  enmity.  Among  those  who  came  for  initiation  was  one  who,  because  Pythagoras  refused  to <br/>admit  him,  determined  to  destroy  both  the  man  and  his  philosophy.  By  means  of  false  propaganda, <br/>this  disgruntled  one  turned  the  minds  of  the  common  people  against  the  philosopher.  Without <br/>warning,  a  band  of  murderers  descended  upon  the  little  group  of  buildings  where  the  great  teacher <br/>and  his  disciples  dwelt,  burned  the  structures  and  killed  Pythagoras. <br/><br/>Accounts  of  the  philosopher's  death  do  not  agree.  Some  say  that  he  was  murdered  with  his  disciples; <br/>others  that,  on  escaping  from  Crotona  with  a  small  band  of  followers,  he  was  trapped  and  burned <br/>alive  by  his  enemies  in  a  little  house  where  the  band  had  decided  to  rest  for  the  night.  Another <br/>account  states  that,  finding  themselves  trapped  in  the  burning  structure,  the  disciples  threw <br/>themselves  into  the  flames,  making  of  their  own  bodies  a  bridge  over  which  Pythagoras  escaped,  only <br/>to  die  of  a  broken  heart  a  short  time  afterwards  as  the  result  of  grieving  over  the  apparent <br/>fruitlessness  of  his  efforts  to  serve  and  illuminate  mankind. <br/><br/>His  surviving  disciples  attempted  to  perpetuate  his  doctrines,  but  they  were  persecuted  on  every  hand <br/>and  very  little  remains  today  as  a  testimonial  to  the  greatness  of  this  philosopher.  It  is  said  that  the <br/>disciples  of  Pythagoras  never  addressed  him  or  referred  to  him  by  his  own  name,  but  always  as  The <br/>Master  or  That  Man.  This  may  have  been  because  of  the  fact  that  the  name  Pythagoras  was  believed <br/>to  consist  of  a  certain  number  of  specially  arranged  letters  with  great  sacred  significance.  The <br/>Word  magazine  has  printed  an  article  by  T.  R.  Prater,  showing  that  Pjfthagoras  initiated  his <br/>candidates  by  means  of  a  certain  formula  concealed  within <br/><br/><br/>PYTHAGORAS,  THE  FIRST  PHILOSOPHER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>During  his  youth,  Pythagoras  was  a  disciple  of  Pherecydes  and  Hermodamas,  and  while  in  his  teens  became  renowned  for <br/>the  clarity  of  his  philosophic  concepts.  In  height  he  exceeded  six  feet;  his  body  was  as  perfectly  formed  as  that  of  Apollo. <br/>Pythagoras  was  the  personification  of  majesty  and  power,  and  in  his  presence  a  felt  humble  and  afraid.  As  he  grew  older, <br/>his  physical  power  increased  rather  than  waned,  so  that  as  he  approached  the  century  mark  he  was  actually  in  the  prime <br/>of  life.  The  influence  of  this  great  soul  over  those  about  him  was  such  that  a  word  of  praise  from  P5^hagoras  filled  his <br/>disciples  with  ecstasy,  while  one  committed  suicide  because  the  Master  became  momentarily  irritate  over  something  he <br/>had  dome.  Pythagoras  was  so  impressed  by  this  tragedy  that  he  never  again  spoke  unkindly  to  or  about  anyone. <br/><br/>p.  66 <br/><br/>the  letters  of  his  own  name.  This  may  explain  why  the  word  Pj^hagoras  was  so  highly  revered. <br/><br/>After  the  death  of  Pythagoras  his  school  gradually  disintegrated,  but  those  who  had  benefited  by  its <br/>teachings  revered  the  memory  of  the  great  philosopher,  as  during  his  life  they  had  reverenced  the <br/>man  himself.  As  time  went  on,  Pythagoras  came  to  be  regarded  as  a  god  rather  than  a  man,  and  his <br/>scattered  disciples  were  bound  together  by  their  common  admiration  for  the  transcendent  genius  of <br/>their  teacher.  Edouard  Schure,  in  his  Pythagoras  and  the  Delphic  Mysteries,  relates  the  following <br/>incident  as  illustrative  of  the  bond  of  fellowship  uniting  the  members  of  the  Pythagorean  School: <br/><br/>&quot;One  of  them  who  had  fallen  upon  sickness  and  poverty  was  kindly  taken  in  by  an  innkeeper.  Before <br/>dying  he  traced  a  few  mysterious  signs  (the  pentagram,  no  doubt)  on  the  door  of  the  inn  and  said  to <br/>the  host,  'Do  not  be  uneasy,  one  of  my  brothers  will  pay  my  debts.'  A  year  afterwards,  as  a  stranger <br/>was  passing  by  this  inn  he  saw  the  signs  and  said  to  the  host,  'I  am  a  Pythagorean;  one  of  my  brothers <br/>died  here;  tell  me  what  I  owe  you  on  his  account.'&quot; <br/><br/>Frank  C.  Higgins,  32&#x00b0;,  gives  an  excellent  compendium  of  the  Pj^hagorean  tenets  in  the  following <br/>outline: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;P5rthagoras'  teachings  are  of  the  most  transcendental  importance  to  Masons,  inasmuch  as  they  are <br/>the  necessary  fruit  of  his  contact  with  the  leading  philosophers  of  the  whole  civilized  world  of  his  own <br/>day,  and  must  represent  that  in  which  all  were  agreed,  shorn  of  all  weeds  of  controversy.  Thus,  the <br/>determined  stand  made  by  Pythagoras,  in  defense  of  pure  monotheism,  is  sufficient  evidence  that  the <br/>tradition  to  the  effect  that  the  unity  of  God  was  the  supreme  secret  of  all  the  ancient  initiations  is <br/>substantially  correct.  The  philosophical  school  of  Pythagoras  was,  in  a  measure,  also  a  series  of <br/>initiations,  for  he  caused  his  pupils  to  pass  through  a  series  of  degrees  and  never  permitted  them <br/>personal  contact  with  himself  until  they  had  reached  the  higher  grades.  According  to  his  biographers, <br/>his  degrees  were  three  in  number.  The  first,  that  of  'Mathematicus,'  assuring  his  pupils  proficiency  in <br/>mathematics  and  geometry,  which  was  then,  as  it  would  be  now  if  Masonry  were  properly  inculcated, <br/>the  basis  upon  which  all  other  knowledge  was  erected.  Secondly,  the  degree  of  'Theoreticus,'  which <br/>dealt  with  superficial  applications  of  the  exact  sciences,  and,  lastly,  the  degree  of  'Electus,'  which <br/>entitled  the  candidate  to  pass  forward  into  the  light  of  the  fullest  illumination  which  he  was  capable  of <br/>absorbing.  The  pupils  of  the  Pythagorean  school  were  divided  into  'exoterici,'  or  pupils  in  the  outer <br/>grades,  and  'esoterici,'  after  they  had  passed  the  third  degree  of  initiation  and  were  entitled  to  the <br/>secret  wisdom.  Silence,  secrecy  and  unconditional  obedience  were  cardinal  principles  of  this  great <br/>order.&quot;  (See  Ancient  Freemasonry.) <br/><br/>PYTHAGORIC  FUNDAMENTALS <br/><br/>The  study  of  geometry,  music,  and  astronomy  was  considered  essential  to  a  rational  understanding  of <br/>God,  man,  or  Nature,  and  no  one  could  accompany  Pythagoras  as  a  disciple  who  was  not  thoroughly <br/>familiar  with  these  sciences.  Many  came  seeking  admission  to  his  school.  Each  applicant  was  tested <br/>on  these  three  subjects,  and  if  found  ignorant,  was  summarily  dismissed. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  was  not  an  extremist.  He  taught  moderation  in  all  things  rather  than  excess  in  anything, <br/>for  he  believed  that  an  excess  of  virtue  was  in  itself  a  vice.  One  of  his  favorite  statements  was:  &quot;We <br/>must  avoid  with  our  utmost  endeavor,  and  amputate  with  fire  and  sword,  and  by  all  other  means, <br/>from  the  body,  sickness;  from  the  soul,  ignorance;  from  the  belly,  luxury;  from  a  city,  sedition;  from  a <br/>family,  discord;  and  from  all  things,  excess.&quot;  Pythagoras  also  believed  that  there  was  no  crime  equal <br/>to  that  of  anarchy. <br/><br/>All  men  know  what  they  want,  but  few  know  what  they  need.  Pythagoras  warned  his  disciples  that <br/>when  they  prayed  they  should  not  pray  for  themselves;  that  when  they  asked  things  of  the  gods  they <br/>should  not  ask  things  for  themselves,  because  no  man  knows  what  is  good  for  him  and  it  is  for  this <br/>reason  undesirable  to  ask  for  things  which,  if  obtained,  would  only  prove  to  be  injurious. <br/><br/>The  God  of  Pythagoras  was  the  Monad,  or  the  One  that  is  Everything.  He  described  God  as  the <br/>Supreme  Mind  distributed  throughout  all  parts  of  the  universe&#x2014; the  Cause  of  all  things,  the <br/>Intelligence  of  all  things,  and  the  Power  within  all  things.  He  further  declared  the  motion  of  God  to  be <br/>circular,  the  body  of  God  to  be  composed  of  the  substance  of  light,  and  the  nature  of  God  to  be <br/>composed  of  the  substance  of  truth. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  declared  that  the  eating  of  meat  clouded  the  reasoning  faculties.  While  he  did  not <br/>condemn  its  use  or  totally  abstain  therefrom  himself,  he  declared  that  judges  should  refrain  from <br/>eating  meat  before  a  trial,  in  order  that  those  who  appeared  before  them  might  receive  the  most <br/>honest  and  astute  decisions.  When  Pjrthagoras  decided  (as  he  often  did)  to  retire  into  the  temple  of <br/>God  for  an  extended  period  of  time  to  meditate  and  pray,  he  took  with  his  supply  of  specially <br/>prepared  food  and  drink.  The  food  consisted  of  equal  parts  of  the  seeds  of  poppy  and  sesame,  the  skin <br/>of  the  sea  onion  from  which  the  juice  had  been  thoroughly  extracted,  the  flower  of  daffodil,  the  leaves <br/>of  mallows,  and  a  paste  of  barley  and  peas.  These  he  compounded  together  with  the  addition  of  wild <br/>honey.  For  a  beverage  he  took  the  seeds  of  cucumbers,  dried  raisins  (with  seeds  removed),  the  flowers <br/>of  coriander,  the  seeds  of  mallows  and  purslane,  scraped  cheese,  meal,  and  cream,  mixed  together <br/><br/><br/>and  sweetened  with  wild  honey.  Pythagoras  claimed  that  this  was  the  diet  of  Hercules  while <br/>wandering  in  the  Libyan  desert  and  was  according  to  the  formula  given  to  that  hero  by  the  goddess <br/>Ceres  herself. <br/><br/>The  favorite  method  of  healing  among  the  Pythagoreans  was  by  the  aid  of  poultices.  These  people  also <br/>knew  the  magic  properties  of  vast  numbers  of  plants.  Pythagoras  highly  esteemed  the  medicinal <br/>properties  of  the  sea  onion,  and  he  is  said  to  have  written  an  entire  volume  on  the  subject.  Such  a <br/>work,  however,  is  not  known  at  the  present  time.  Pythagoras  discovered  that  music  had  great <br/>therapeutic  power  and  he  prepared  special  harmonies  for  various  diseases.  He  apparently <br/>experimented  also  with  color,  attaining  considerable  success.  One  of  his  unique  curative  processes <br/>resulted  from  his  discovery  of  the  healing  value  of  certain  verses  from  the  Odyssey  and  the  Iliad  of <br/>Homer.  These  he  caused  to  be  read  to  persons  suffering  from  certain  ailments.  He  was  opposed  to <br/>surgery  in  all  its  forms  and  also  objected  to  cauterizing.  He  would  not  permit  the  disfigurement  of  the <br/>human  body,  for  such,  in  his  estimation,  was  a  sacrilege  against  the  dwelling  place  of  the  gods. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  taught  that  friendship  was  the  truest  and  nearest  perfect  of  all  relationships.  He  declared <br/>that  in  Nature  there  was  a  friendship  of  all  for  all;  of  gods  for  men;  of  doctrines  one  for  another;  of  the <br/>soul  for  the  body;  of  the  rational  part  for  the  irrational  part;  of  philosophy  for  its  theory;  of  men  for <br/>one  another;  of  countrymen  for  one  another;  that  friendship  also  existed  between  strangers,  between <br/>a  man  and  his  wife,  his  children,  and  his  servants.  All  bonds  without  friendship  were  shackles,  and <br/>there  was  no  virtue  in  their  maintenance.  Pythagoras  believed  that  relationships  were  essentially <br/>mental  rather  than  physical,  and  that  a  stranger  of  sympathetic  intellect  was  closer  to  him  than  a <br/>blood  relation  whose  viewpoint  was  at  variance  with  his  own.  Pythagoras  defined  knowledge  as  the <br/>fruitage  of  mental  accumulation.  He  believed  that  it  would  be  obtained  in  many  ways,  but  principally <br/>through  observation.  Wisdom  was  the  understanding  of  the  source  or  cause  of  all  things,  and  this <br/>could  be  secured  only  by  raising  the  intellect  to  a  point  where  it  intuitively  cognized  the  invisible <br/>manifesting  outwardly  through  the  visible,  and  thus  became  capable  of  bringing  itself  en  rapport  with <br/>the  spirit  of  things  rather  than  with  their  forms.  The  ultimate  source  that  wisdom  could  cognize  was <br/>the  Monad,  the  mysterious  permanent  atom  of  the  Pythagoreans. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  taught  that  both  man  and  the  universe  were  made  in  the  image  of  God;  that  both  being <br/>made  in  the  same  image,  the  understanding  of  one  predicated  the  knowledge  of  the  other.  He  further <br/>taught  that  there  was  a  constant  interplay  between  the  Grand  Man  (the  universe)  and  man  (the  little <br/>universe). <br/><br/>Pythagoras  believed  that  all  the  sidereal  bodies  were  alive  and  that  the  forms  of  the  planets  and  stars <br/>were  merely  bodies  encasing  souls,  minds,  and  spirits  in  the  same  manner  that  the  visible  human <br/>form  is  but  the  encasing  vehicle  for  an  invisible  spiritual  organism  which  is,  in  reality,  the  conscious <br/>individual.  Pythagoras  regarded  the  planets  as  magnificent  deities,  worthy  of  the  adoration  and <br/>respect  of  man.  All  these  deities,  however,  he  considered  subservient  to  the  One  First  Cause  within <br/>whom  they  all  existed  temporarily,  as  mortality  exists  in  the  midst  of  immortality. <br/><br/>The  famous  Pythagorean  Y  signified  the  power  of  choice  and  was  used  in  the  Mysteries  as  emblematic <br/>of  the  Forking  of  the  Ways.  The  central  stem  separated  into  two  parts,  one  branching  to <br/><br/><br/>6 <br/><br/>THE  SYMMETRICAL  GEOMETRIC  SOLIDS. <br/><br/><br/>To  the  five  symmetrical  solids  of  the  ancients  is  added  the  sphere  (i),  the  most  perfect  of  all  created  forms.  The  five <br/>Pythagorean  solids  are:  the  tetrahedron  (2)  with  four  equilateral  triangles  as  faces;  the  cube  (3)  with  six  squares  as  faces; <br/>the  octahedron  (4)  with  eight  equilateral  triangles  as  faces;  the  icosahedron  (5)  with  twenty  equilateral  triangles  as  faces; <br/>and  the  dodecahedron  (6)  with  twelve  regular  pentagons  as  faces. <br/><br/>p.  67 <br/><br/><br/>the  right  and  the  other  to  the  left.  The  branch  to  the  right  was  called  Divine  Wisdom  and  the  one  to <br/><br/>the  left  Earthly  Wisdom.  Youth,  personified  by  the  candidate,  walking  the  Path  of  Life,  symbolized  by <br/>the  central  stem  of  the  Y,  reaches  the  point  where  the  Path  divides.  The  neophyte  must  then  choose <br/>whether  he  will  take  the  left-hand  path  and,  following  the  dictates  of  his  lower  nature,  enter  upon  a <br/>span  of  folly  and  thoughtlessness  which  will  inevitably  result  in  his  undoing,  or  whether  he  will  take <br/>the  right-hand  road  and  through  integrity,  industry,  and  sincerity  ultimately  regain  union  with  the <br/>immortals  in  the  superior  spheres. <br/><br/>It  is  probable  that  P)^hagoras  obtained  his  concept  of  the  Y  from  the  Egyptians,  who  included  in <br/>certain  of  their  initiatory  rituals  a  scene  in  which  the  candidate  was  confronted  by  two  female  figures. <br/>One  of  them,  veiled  with  the  white  robes  of  the  temple,  urged  the  neophyte  to  enter  into  the  halls  of <br/>learning;  the  other,  bedecked  with  jewels,  symbolizing  earthly  treasures,  and  bearing  in  her  hands  a <br/>tray  loaded  with  grapes  (emblematic  of  false  light),  sought  to  lure  him  into  the  chambers  of <br/>dissipation.  This  symbol  is  still  preserved  among  the  Tarot  cards,  where  it  is  called  The  Forking  of  the <br/>Ways.  The  forked  stick  has  been  the  symbol  of  life  among  many  nations,  and  it  was  placed  in  the <br/>desert  to  indicate  the  presence  of  water. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  theory  of  transmigration  as  disseminated  by  Pythagoras,  there  are  differences  of <br/>opinion.  According  to  one  view,  he  taught  that  mortals  who  during  their  earthly  existence  had  by  their <br/>actions  become  like  certain  animals,  returned  to  earth  again  in  the  form  of  the  beasts  which  they  had <br/>grovm  to  resemble.  Thus,  a  timid  person  would  return  in  the  form  of  a  rabbit  or  a  deer;  a  cruel  person <br/>in  the  form  of  a  wolf  or  other  ferocious  animal;  and  a  cunning  person  in  the  guise  of  a  fox.  This <br/>concept,  however,  does  not  fit  into  the  general  Pythagorean  scheme,  and  it  is  far  more  likely  that  it <br/>was  given  in  an  allegorical  rather  than  a  literal  sense.  It  was  intended  to  convey  the  idea  that  human <br/>beings  become  bestial  when  they  allow  themselves  to  be  dominated  by  their  ovm  lower  desires  and <br/>destructive  tendencies.  It  is  probable  that  the  term  transmigration  is  to  be  understood  as  what  is <br/>more  commonly  called  reincarnation,  a  doctrine  which  Pythagoras  must  have  contacted  directly  or <br/>indirectly  in  India  and  Egypt. <br/><br/>The  fact  that  Pythagoras  accepted  the  theory  of  successive  reappearances  of  the  spiritual  nature  in <br/>human  form  is  found  in  a  footnote  to  Levi's  History  of  Magic:  &quot;He  was  an  important  champion  of <br/>what  used  to  be  called  the  doctrine  of  metempsychosis,  understood  as  the  soul's  transmigration  into <br/>successive  bodies.  He  himself  had  been  (a)  Aethalides,  a  son  of  Mercury;  (b)  Euphorbus,  son  of <br/>Panthus,  who  perished  at  the  hands  of  Menelaus  in  the  Trojan  war;  (c)  Hermotimus,  a  prophet  of <br/>Clazomenae,  a  city  of  Ionia;  (d)  a  humble  fisherman;  and  finally  (e)  the  philosopher  of  Samos.&quot; <br/><br/>Pythagoras  also  taught  that  each  species  of  creatures  had  what  he  termed  a  seal,  given  to  it  by  God, <br/>and  that  the  physical  form  of  each  was  the  impression  of  this  seal  upon  the  wax  of  physical  substance. <br/>Thus  each  body  was  stamped  with  the  dignity  of  its  divinely  given  pattern.  Pythagoras  believed  that <br/>ultimately  man  would  reach  a  state  where  he  would  cast  off  his  gross  nature  and  function  in  a  body  of <br/>spiritualized  ether  which  would  be  in  juxtaposition  to  his  physical  form  at  all  times  and  which  might <br/>be  the  eighth  sphere,  or  Antichthon.  From  this  he  would  ascend  into  the  realm  of  the  immortals, <br/>where  by  divine  birthright  he  belonged. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  taught  that  everything  in  nature  was  divisible  into  three  parts  and  that  no  one  could <br/>become  truly  wise  who  did  not  view  every  problem  as  being  diagrammatically  triangular.  He  said, <br/>&quot;Establish  the  triangle  and  the  problem  is  two-thirds  solved&quot;;  further,  &quot;All  things  consist  of  three.&quot;  In <br/>conformity  with  this  viewpoint,  Pythagoras  divided  the  universe  into  three  parts,  which  he  called  the <br/>Supreme  World,  the  Superior  World,  and  the  Inferior  World.  The  highest,  or  Supreme  World,  was  a <br/>subtle,  interpenetrative  spiritual  essence  pervading  all  things  and  therefore  the  true  plane  of  the <br/>Supreme  Deity  itself,  the  Deity  being  in  every  sense  omnipresent,  omniactive,  omnipotent,  and <br/>omniscient.  Both  of  the  lower  worlds  existed  within  the  nature  of  this  supreme  sphere. <br/><br/><br/>The  Superior  Worid  was  the  home  of  the  immortals.  It  was  also  the  dwelling  place  of  the  archetypes, <br/><br/>or  the  seals;  their  natures  in  no  manner  partook  of  the  material  of  earthiness,  but  they,  casting  their <br/>shadows  upon  the  deep  (the  Inferior  World),  were  cognizable  only  through  their  shadows.  The  third, <br/>or  Inferior  World,  was  the  home  of  those  creatures  who  partook  of  material  substance  or  were <br/>engaged  in  labor  with  or  upon  material  substance.  Hence,  this  sphere  was  the  home  of  the  mortal <br/>gods,  the  Demiurgi,  the  angels  who  labor  with  men;  also  the  dsemons  who  partake  of  the  nature  of  the <br/>earth;  and  finally  mankind  and  the  lower  kingdoms,  those  temporarily  of  the  earth  but  capable  of <br/>rising  above  that  sphere  by  reason  and  philosophy. <br/><br/>The  digits  i  and  2  are  not  considered  numbers  by  the  Pythagoreans,  because  they  typify  the  two <br/>supermundane  spheres.  The  Pythagorean  numbers,  therefore,  begin  with  3,  the  triangle,  and  4,  the <br/>square.  These  added  to  the  1  and  the  2,  produce  the  10,  the  great  number  of  all  things,  the  archetype <br/>of  the  universe.  The  three  worlds  were  called  receptacles.  The  first  was  the  receptacle  of  principles, <br/>the  second  was  the  receptacle  of  intelligences,  and  the  third,  or  lowest,  was  the  receptacle  of <br/>quantities. <br/><br/>&quot;The  symmetrical  solids  were  regarded  by  Pythagoras,  and  by  the  Greek  thinkers  after  him,  as  of  the <br/>greatest  importance.  To  be  perfectly  symmetrical  or  regular,  a  solid  must  have  an  equal  number  of <br/>faces  meeting  at  each  of  its  angles,  and  these  faces  must  be  equal  regular  polygons,  i.  e.,  figures  whose <br/>sides  and  angles  are  all  equal.  Pythagoras,  perhaps,  may  be  credited  with  the  great  discovery  that <br/>there  are  only  five  such  solids.*  *  * <br/><br/>'Now,  the  Greeks  believed  the  world  [material  universe]  to  be  composed  of  four  elements&#x2014;earth,  air, <br/>fire,  water&#x2014;and  to  the  Greek  mind  the  conclusion  was  inevitable  that  the  shapes  of  the  particles  of  the <br/>elements  were  those  of  the  regular  solids.  Earth-particles  were  cubical,  the  cube  being  the  regular <br/>solid  possessed  of  greatest  stability;  fire-particles  were  tetrahedral,  the  tetrahedron  being  the  simplest <br/>and,  hence,  lightest  solid.  Water-particles  were  icosahedral  for  exactly  the  reverse  reason,  whilst  air- <br/>particles,  as  intermediate  between  the  two  latter,  were  octahedral.  The  dodecahedron  was,  to  these <br/>ancient  mathematicians,  the  most  mysterious  of  the  solids;  it  was  by  far  the  most  difficult  to  construct, <br/>the  accurate  drav^ng  of  the  regular  pentagon  necessitating  a  rather  elaborate  application  of <br/>Pythagoras'  great  theorem.  Hence  the  conclusion,  as  Plato  put  it,  that  'this  (the  regular  dodecahedron) <br/>the  Deity  employed  in  tracing  the  plan  of  the  Universe.'  (H.  Stanley  Redgrove,  in  Bygone  Beliefs.) <br/><br/>Mr.  Redgrove  has  not  mentioned  the  fifth  element  of  the  ancient  Mysteries,  that  which  would  make <br/>the  analogy  between  the  symmetrical  solids  and  the  elements  complete.  This  fifth  element,  or  ether, <br/>was  called  by  the  Hindus  akasa.  It  was  closely  correlated  with  the  hypothetical  ether  of  modern <br/>science,  and  was  the  interpenetrative  substance  permeating  all  of  the  other  elements  and  acting  as  a <br/>common  solvent  and  common  denominator  of  them.  The  twelve-faced  solid  also  subtly  referred  to  the <br/>Twelve  Immortals  who  surfaced  the  universe,  and  also  to  the  twelve  convolutions  of  the  human  brain- <br/>-the  vehicles  of  those  Immortals  in  the  nature  of  man. <br/><br/>While  Pythagoras,  in  accordance  with  others  of  his  day,  practiced  divination  (possibly  arithmomancy), <br/>there  is  no  accurate  information  concerning  the  methods  which  he  used.  He  is  believed  to  have  had  a <br/>remarkable  wheel  by  means  of  which  he  could  predict  future  events,  and  to  have  learned  hydromancy <br/>from  the  Egyptians.  He  believed  that  brass  had  oracular  powers,  because  even  when  everything  was <br/>perfectly  still  there  was  always  a  rumbling  sound  in  brass  bowls.  He  once  addressed  a  prayer  to  the <br/>spirit  of  a  river  and  out  of  the  water  arose  a  voice,  &quot;Pythagoras,  I  greet  thee.&quot;  It  is  claimed  for  him  that <br/>he  was  able  to  cause  demons  to  enter  into  water  and  disturb  its  surface,  and  by  means  of  the <br/>agitations  certain  things  were  predicted. <br/><br/>After  having  drunk  from  a  certain  spring  one  day,  one  of  the  Masters  of  Pythagoras  announced  that <br/><br/>the  spirit  of  the  water  had  just  predicted  that  a  great  earthquake  would  occur  the  next  day&#x2014; a <br/>prophecy  which  was  fulfilled.  It  is  highly  probable  that  Pythagoras  possessed  hypnotic  power,  not <br/><br/><br/>only  over  man  but  also  over  animals.  He  caused  a  bird  to  change  the  course  of  its  flight,  a  bear  to <br/>cease  its  ravages  upon  a  community,  and  a  bull  to  change  its  diet,  by  the  exercise  of  mental  influence. <br/>He  was  also  gifted  with  second  sight,  being  able  to  see  things  at  a  distance  and  accurately  describe <br/>incidents  that  had  not  yet  come  to  pass. <br/><br/>THE  SYMBOUC  APHORISMS  OF  PYTHAGORAS <br/><br/>lamblichus  gathered  thirty-nine  of  the  symbolic  sayings  of  Pythagoras  and  interpreted  them.  These <br/>have  been  translated  from  the  Greek  by  Thomas  Taylor.  Aphorismic  statement  was  one  of  the  favorite <br/>methods  of  instruction  used  in  the  Pythagorean  university  of  Crotona.  Ten  of  the  most  representative <br/>of  these  aphorisms  are  reproduced  below  with  a  brief  elucidation  of  their  concealed  meanings. <br/><br/>I.  Declining  from  the  public  ways,  walk  in  unfrequented  paths.  By  this  it  is  to  be  understood  that <br/>those  who  desire  wisdom  must  seek  it  in  solitude. <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/><br/>J-  I <br/><br/><br/>NUMBER  RELATED  TO  FORM. <br/><br/><br/>Pythagoras  taught  that  the  dot  symbohzed  the  power  of  the  number  i,  the  hne  the  power  of  the  number  2,  the  surface  the <br/>power  of  the  number  3,  and  the  soUd  the  power  of  the  number  4. <br/><br/>p.  68 <br/><br/>n.  Govern  your  tongue  before  all  other  things,  following  the  gods.  This  aphorism  warns  man  that  his <br/>words,  instead  of  representing  him,  misrepresent  him,  and  that  when  in  doubt  as  to  what  he  should <br/>say,  he  should  always  be  silent. <br/><br/><br/>III.  The  wind  blowing,  adore  the  sound.  Pythagoras  here  reminds  his  disciples  that  the  fiat  of  God  is <br/>heard  in  the  voice  of  the  elements,  and  that  all  things  in  Nature  manifest  through  harmony,  rhythm, <br/>order,  or  procedure  the  attributes  of  the  Deity. <br/><br/>IV.  Assist  a  man  in  raising  a  burden;  but  do  not  assist  him  in  laying  it  down.  The  student  is <br/>instructed  to  aid  the  diligent  but  never  to  assist  those  who  seek  to  evade  their  responsibilities,  for  it  is <br/>a  great  sin  to  encourage  indolence. <br/><br/>V.  Speak  not  about  Pythagoric  concerns  without  light.  The  world  is  herein  warned  that  it  should  not <br/>attempt  to  interpret  the  mysteries  of  God  and  the  secrets  of  the  sciences  without  spiritual  and <br/>intellectual  illumination. <br/><br/>VI.  Having  departed  from  your  house,  turn  not  back,  for  the  furies  will  be  your  attendants. <br/>Pythagoras  here  warns  his  followers  that  any  who  begin  the  search  for  truth  and,  after  having  learned <br/>part  of  the  mystery,  become  discouraged  and  attempt  to  return  again  to  their  former  ways  of  vice  and <br/>ignorance,  will  suffer  exceedingly;  for  it  is  better  to  know  nothing  about  Divinity  than  to  learn  a  little <br/>and  then  stop  without  learning  all. <br/><br/>VII.  Nourish  a  cock,  but  sacrifice  it  not;  for  it  is  sacred  to  the  sun  and  moon.  Two  great  lessons  are <br/>concealed  in  this  aphorism.  The  first  is  a  warning  against  the  sacrifice  of  living  things  to  the  gods, <br/>because  life  is  sacred  and  man  should  not  destroy  it  even  as  an  offering  to  the  Deity.  The  second <br/>warns  man  that  the  human  body  here  referred  to  as  a  cock  is  sacred  to  the  sun  (God)  and  the  moon <br/>(Nature),  and  should  be  guarded  and  preserved  as  man's  most  precious  medium  of  expression. <br/>Pythagoras  also  warned  his  disciples  against  suicide. <br/><br/>VIII.  Receive  not  a  swallow  into  your  house.  This  warns  the  seeker  after  truth  not  to  allow  drifting <br/>thoughts  to  come  into  his  mind  nor  shiftless  persons  to  enter  into  his  life.  He  must  ever  surround <br/>himself  with  rationally  inspired  thinkers  and  with  conscientious  workers. <br/><br/>IX.  Offer  not  your  right  hand  easily  to  anyone.  This  warns  the  disciple  to  keep  his  own  counsel  and <br/>not  offer  wisdom  and  knowledge  (his  right  hand)  to  such  as  are  incapable  of  appreciating  them.  The <br/>hand  here  represents  Truth,  which  raises  those  who  have  fallen  because  of  ignorance;  but  as  many  of <br/>the  unregenerate  do  not  desire  wisdom  they  will  cut  off  the  hand  that  is  extended  in  kindness  to  them. <br/>Time  alone  can  effect  the  redemption  of  the  ignorant  masses <br/><br/>X.  When  rising  from  the  bedclothes,  roll  them  together,  and  obliterate  the  impression  of  the  body. <br/>Pythagoras  directed  his  disciples  who  had  awakened  from  the  sleep  of  ignorance  into  the  waking  state <br/>of  intelligence  to  eliminate  from  their  recollection  all  memory  of  their  former  spiritual  darkness;  for  a <br/>wise  man  in  passing  leaves  no  form  behind  him  which  others  less  intelligent,  seeing,  shall  use  as  a <br/>mold  for  the  casting  of  idols. <br/><br/>The  most  famous  of  the  Pythagorean  fragments  are  the  Golden  Verses,  ascribed  to  Pythagoras  himself, <br/>but  concerning  whose  authorship  there  is  an  element  of  doubt.  The  Golden  Verses  contain  a  brief <br/>summary  of  the  entire  system  of  philosophy  forming  the  basis  of  the  educational  doctrines  of  Crotona, <br/>or,  as  it  is  more  commonly  known,  the  Italic  School.  These  verses  open  by  counseling  the  reader  to <br/>love  God,  venerate  the  great  heroes,  and  respect  the  deemons  and  elemental  inhabitants.  They  then <br/>urge  man  to  think  carefully  and  industriously  concerning  his  daily  life,  and  to  prefer  the  treasures  of <br/>the  mind  and  soul  to  accumulations  of  earthly  goods.  The  verses  also  promise  man  that  if  he  will  rise <br/>above  his  lower  material  nature  and  cultivate  self-control,  he  will  ultimately  be  acceptable  in  the  sight <br/>of  the  gods,  be  reunited  with  them,  and  partake  of  their  immortality.  (It  is  rather  significant  to  note <br/>that  Plato  paid  a  great  price  for  some  of  the  manuscripts  of  Pjlihagoras  which  had  been  saved  from <br/>the  destruction  of  Crotona.  See  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum,  Geneva,  1675.) <br/><br/><br/>PYTHAGOREAN  ASTRONOMY <br/><br/><br/>According  to  Pythagoras,  the  position  of  each  body  in  the  universe  was  determined  by  the  essential <br/>dignity  of  that  body.  The  popular  concept  of  his  day  was  that  the  earth  occupied  the  center  of  the  solar <br/>system;  that  the  planets,  including  the  sun  and  moon,  moved  about  the  earth;  and  that  the  earth  itself <br/>was  flat  and  square.  Contrary  to  this  concept,  and  regardless  of  criticism,  Pjlihagoras  declared  that <br/>fire  was  the  most  important  of  all  the  elements;  that  the  center  was  the  most  important  part  of  every <br/>body;  and  that,  just  as  Vesta's  fire  was  in  the  midst  of  every  home,  so  in  the  midst  of  the  universe  was <br/>a  flaming  sphere  of  celestial  radiance.  This  central  globe  he  called  the  Tower  of  Jupiter,  the  Globe  of <br/>Unity,  the  Grand  Monad,  and  the  Altar  of  Vesta.  As  the  sacred  number  lo  symbolized  the  sum  of  all <br/>parts  and  the  completeness  of  all  things,  it  was  only  natural  for  Pythagoras  to  divide  the  universe  into <br/>ten  spheres,  symbolized  by  ten  concentric  circles.  These  circles  began  at  the  center  with  the  globe  of <br/>Divine  Fire;  then  came  the  seven  planers,  the  earth,  and  another  mysterious  planet,  caWed  Antichthon, <br/>which  was  never  visible. <br/><br/>Opinions  differ  as  to  the  nature  of  Antichthon.  Clement  of  Alexandria  believed  that  it  represented  the <br/>mass  of  the  heavens;  others  held  the  opinion  that  it  was  the  moon.  More  probably  it  was  the <br/>mysterious  eighth  sphere  of  the  ancients,  the  dark  planet  which  moved  in  the  same  orbit  as  the  earth <br/>but  which  was  always  concealed  from  the  earth  by  the  body  of  the  sun,  being  in  exact  opposition  to <br/>the  earth  at  all  times.  Is  this  the  mysterious  Lilith  concerning  which  astrologers  have  speculated  so <br/>long? <br/><br/>Isaac  Myer  has  stated:  &quot;The  Pythagoreans  held  that  each  star  was  a  world  having  its  own  atmosphere, <br/>with  an  immense  extent  surrounding  it,  of  aether.&quot;  (See  The  Qabbalah.)  The  disciples  of  Pythagoras <br/>also  highly  revered  the  planet  Venus,  because  it  was  the  only  planet  bright  enough  to  cast  a  shadow. <br/>As  the  morning  star,  Venus  is  visible  before  sunrise,  and  as  the  evening  star  it  shines  forth <br/>immediately  after  sunset.  Because  of  these  qualities,  a  number  of  names  have  been  given  to  it  by  the <br/>ancients.  Being  visible  in  the  sky  at  sunset,  it  was  called  vesper,  and  as  it  arose  before  the  sun,  it  was <br/>called  the  false  light,  the  star  of  the  morning,  or  Lucifer,  which  means  the  light-bearer.  Because  of <br/>this  relation  to  the  sun,  the  planet  was  also  referred  to  as  Venus,  Astarte,  Aphrodite,  Isis,  and  The <br/>Mother  of  the  Gods.  It  is  possible  that:  at  some  seasons  of  the  year  in  certain  latitudes  the  fact  that <br/>Venus  was  a  crescent  could  be  detected  without  the  aid  of  a  telescope.  This  would  account  for  the <br/>crescent  which  is  often  seen  in  connection  with  the  goddesses  of  antiquity,  the  stories  of  which  do  not <br/>agree  with  the  phases  of  the  moon.  The  accurate  knowledge  which  Pythagoras  possessed  concerning <br/>astronomy  he  undoubtedly  secured  in  the  Egyptian  temples,  for  their  priests  understood  the  true <br/>relationship  of  the  heavenly  bodies  many  thousands  of  years  before  that  knowledge  was  revealed  to <br/>the  uninitiated  world.  The  fact  that  the  knowledge  he  acquired  in  the  temples  enabled  him  to  make <br/>assertions  requiring  two  thousand  years  to  check  proves  why  Plato  and  Aristotle  so  highly  esteemed <br/>the  profundity  of  the  ancient  Mysteries.  In  the  midst  of  comparative  scientific  ignorance,  and  without <br/>the  aid  of  any  modern  instruments,  the  priest-philosophers  had  discovered  the  true  fundamentals  of <br/>universal  dynamics. <br/><br/>An  interesting  application  of  the  Pythagorean  doctrine  of  geometric  solids  as  expounded  by  Plato  is <br/>found  in  The  Canon.  &quot;Nearly  all  the  old  philosophers,&quot;  says  its  anonymous  author,  &quot;devised  an <br/>harmonic  theory  with  respect  to  the  universe,  and  the  practice  continued  till  the  old  mode  of <br/>philosophizing  died  out.  Kepler  (1596),  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  Platonic  doctrine,  that  the <br/>universe  was  formed  of  the  five  regular  solids,  proposed  the  following  rule.  'The  earth  is  a  circle,  the <br/>measurer  of  all.  Round  it  describe  a  dodecahedron;  the  circle  inclosing  this  will  be  Mars.  Round  Mars <br/>describe  a  tetrahedron;  the  sphere  inclosing  this  will  be  Jupiter.  Describe  a  cube  round  Jupiter;  the <br/>sphere  containing  this  will  be  Saturn.  Now  inscribe  in  the  earth  an  icosahedron;  the  circle  inscribed  in <br/>it  will  be  Venus.  Inscribe  an  octahedron  in  Venus;  the  circle  inscribed  in  it  will  be  Mercury' <br/>(Mysterium  Cosmographicum,  1596).  This  rule  cannot  be  taken  seriously  as  a  real  statement  of  the <br/>proportions  of  the  cosmos,  fox  it  bears  no  real  resemblance  to  the  ratios  published  by  Copernicus  in <br/><br/><br/>the  beginning  of  the  sixteenth  century.  Yet  Kepler  was  very  proud  of  his  formula,  and  said  he  valued  it <br/>more  than  the  Electorate  of  Saxony.  It  was  also  approved  by  those  two  eminent  authorities,  Tycho <br/>and  Galileo,  who  evidently  understood  it.  Kepler  himself  never  gives  the  least  hint  of  how  his  precious <br/>rule  is  to  be  interpreted.&quot;  Platonic  astronomy  was  not  concerned  with  the  material  constitution  or <br/>arrangement  of  the  heavenly  bodies,  but  considered  the  stars  and  planers  primarily  as  focal  points  of <br/>Divine  intelligence.  Physical  astronomy  was  regarded  as  the  science  of  &quot;shadows,&quot;  philosophical <br/>astronomy  the  science  of  &quot;realities.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  TETRACTYS. <br/><br/><br/>Theon  of  Smyrna  declares  that  the  ten  dots,  or  tetractys  of  Pj^hagoras,  was  a  symbol  of  the  greatest  importance,  for  to  the <br/>discerning  mind  it  revealed  the  mystery  of  universal  nature.  The  Pythagoreans  bound  themselves  by  the  following  oath: <br/>&quot;By  Him  who  gave  to  our  soul  the  tetractys,  which  hath  the  fountain  and  root  of  ever-springing  nature.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  CUBE  AND  THE  STAR. <br/><br/><br/>By  connecting  the  ten  dots  of  the  tetractys,  nine  triangles  are  formed.  Six  of  these  are  involved  in  the  forming  of  the  cube. <br/>The  same  triangles,  when  lines  are  properly  drawn  between  them,  also  reveal  the  six-pointed  star  with  a  dot  in  the  center. <br/>Only  seven  dots  are  used  in  forming  the  cube  and  the  star.  Qabbalistically,  the  three  unused  corner  dots  represent  the <br/>threefold,  invisible  causal  nature  of  the  universe,  while  the  seven  dots  involved  in  the  cube  and  the  star  are  the  Elohim&#x2014; <br/>the  Spirits  of  the  seven  creative  periods.  The  Sabbath,  or  seventh  day,  is  the  central  dot. <br/><br/><br/>p.  69 <br/><br/>Pythagorean  Mathematics <br/><br/>CONCERNING  the  secret  significance  of  numbers  there  has  been  much  speculation.  Though  many <br/>interesting  discoveries  have  been  made,  it  may  be  safely  said  that  with  the  death  of  Pythagoras  the <br/>great  key  to  this  science  was  lost.  For  nearly  2500  years  philosophers  of  all  nations  have  attempted  to <br/>unravel  the  Pythagorean  skein,  but  apparently  none  has  been  successful.  Notwithstanding  attempts <br/>made  to  obliterate  all  records  of  the  teachings  of  Pythagoras,  fragments  have  survived  which  give <br/>clues  to  some  of  the  simpler  parts  of  his  philosophy.  The  major  secrets  were  never  committed  to <br/>writing,  but  were  communicated  orally  to  a  few  chosen  disciples.  These  apparently  dated  not  divulge <br/>their  secrets  to  the  profane,  the  result  being  that  when  death  sealed  their  lips  the  arcana  died  with <br/>diem. <br/><br/>Certain  of  the  secret  schools  in  the  world  today  are  perpetuations  of  the  ancient  Mysteries,  and <br/>although  it  is  quite  possible  that  they  may  possess  some  of  the  original  numerical  formula,  there  is  no <br/>evidence  of  it  in  the  voluminous  writings  which  have  issued  from  these  groups  during  the  last  five <br/>hundred  years.  These  writings,  while  frequently  discussing  Pythagoras,  show  no  indication  of  a  more <br/>complete  knowledge  of  his  intricate  doctrines  than  the  post- Pythagorean  Greek  speculators  had,  who <br/>talked  much,  wrote  little,  knew  less,  and  concealed  their  ignorance  under  a  series  of  mysterious  hints <br/>and  promises.  Here  and  there  among  the  literary  products  of  early  writers  are  found  enigmatic <br/>statements  which  they  made  no  effort:  to  interpret.  The  following  example  is  quoted  from  Plutarch: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Pythagoreans  indeed  go  farther  than  this,  and  honour  even  numbers  and  geometrical  diagrams <br/>with  the  names  and  titles  of  the  gods.  Thus  they  call  the  equilateral  triangle  head-born  Minerva  and <br/>Tritogenia,  because  it  may  be  equally  divided  by  three  perpendiculars  drawn  from  each  of  the  angles. <br/>So  the  unit  they  term  Apollo,  as  to  the  number  two  they  have  affixed  the  name  of  strife  and <br/>audaciousness,  and  to  that  of  three,  justice.  For,  as  doing  an  injury  is  an  extreme  on  the  one  side,  and <br/>suffering  one  is  an  extreme  on  the  on  the  one  side,  and  suffering  in  the  middle  between  them.  In  like <br/>manner  the  number  thirty-six,  their  Tetractys,  or  sacred  Quaternion,  being  composed  of  the  first  four <br/>odd  numbers  added  to  the  first  four  even  ones,  as  is  commonly  reported,  is  looked  upon  by  them  as <br/>the  most  solemn  oath  they  can  take,  and  called  Kosmos.&quot;  (Isis  and  Osiris.) <br/><br/>Earlier  in  the  same  work,  Plutarch  also  notes:  &quot;For  as  the  power  of  the  triangle  is  expressive  of  the <br/>nature  of  Pluto,  Bacchus,  and  Mars;  and  the  properties  of  the  square  of  Rhea,  Venus,  Ceres,  Vesta, <br/>and  Juno;  of  the  Dodecahedron  of  Jupiter;  so,  as  we  are  informed  by  Eudoxus,  is  the  figure  of  fifty-six <br/>angles  expressive  of  the  nature  of  Typhon.&quot;  Plutarch  did  not  pretend  to  explain  the  inner  significance <br/>of  the  symbols,  but  believed  that  the  relationship  which  Pythagoras  established  between  the <br/>geometrical  solids  and  the  gods  was  the  result  of  images  the  great  sage  had  seen  in  the  Egyptian <br/>temples. <br/><br/>Albert  Pike,  the  great  Masonic  symbolist,  admitted  that  there  were  many  points  concerning  which  he <br/>could  secure  no  reliable  information.  In  his  Symbolism,  for  the  32&#x00b0;  and  33&#x00b0;,  he  wrote:  &quot;I  do  not <br/>understand  why  the  7  should  be  called  Minerva,  or  the  cube,  Neptune.&quot;  Further  on  he  added: <br/>&quot;Undoubtedly  the  names  given  by  the  Pythagoreans  to  the  different  numbers  were  themselves <br/>enigmatical  and  symbolic-and  there  is  little  doubt  that  in  the  time  of  Plutarch  the  meanings  these <br/>names  concealed  were  lost.  Pythagoras  had  succeeded  too  well  in  concealing  his  symbols  with  a  veil <br/>that  was  from  the  first  impenetrable,  without  his  oral  explanation  *  *  *.&quot; <br/><br/>This  uncertainty  shared  by  all  true  students  of  the  subject  proves  conclusively  that  it  is  unwise  to <br/>make  definite  statements  founded  on  the  indefinite  and  fragmentary  information  available <br/>concerning  the  Pythagorean  system  of  mathematical  philosophy.  The  material  which  follows <br/><br/><br/>represents  an  effort  to  collect  a  few  salient  points  from  the  scattered  records  preserved  by  disciples  of <br/>Pjlihagoras  and  others  who  have  since  contacted  his  philosophy. <br/><br/>METHOD  OF  SECURING  THE  NUMERICAL  POWER  OF  WORDS <br/><br/>The  first  step  in  obtaining  the  numerical  value  of  a  word  is  to  resolve  it  back  into  its  original  tongue. <br/>Only  words  of  Greek  or  Hebrew  derivation  can  be  successfully  analyzed  by  this  method,  and  all  words <br/>must  be  spelled  in  their  most  ancient  and  complete  forms.  Old  Testament  words  and  names, <br/>therefore,  must  be  translated  back  into  the  early  Hebrew  characters  and  New  Testament  words  into <br/>the  Greek.  Two  examples  v^U  help  to  clarify  this  principle. <br/><br/>The  Demiurgus  of  the  Jews  is  called  in  English  Jehovah,  but  when  seeking  the  numerical  value  of  the <br/>name  Jehovah  it  is  necessary  to  resolve  the  name  into  its  Hebrew  letters.  It  becomes  mn%  and  is  read <br/>from  right  to  left.  The  Hebrew  letters  are:  n.  He;  %  Vau;  n.  He;  %  Yod;  and  when  reversed  into  the <br/>English  order  from  left  to  right  read:  Yod-He-Vau-He.  By  consulting  the  foregoing  table  of  letter <br/>values,  it  is  found  that  the  four  characters  of  this  sacred  name  have  the  following  numerical <br/>significance:  Yod  equals  lo.  He  equals  5,  Vau  equals  6,  and  the  second  He  equals  5.  Therefore, <br/>10+5+6+5=26,  a  synonym  of  Jehovah.  If  the  English  letters  were  used,  the  answer  obviously  would <br/>not  be  correct. <br/><br/>The  second  example  is  the  mysterious  Gnostic  pantheos  Abraxas.  For  this  name  the  Greek  table  is <br/>used.  Abraxas  in  Greek  is  A^paEjaq.  A  =  1,  P  =  2,  p  =  100,  a  =  1,  ^  =60,  a  =  1,  g  =  200,  the  sum  being <br/>365,  the  number  of  days  in  the  year.  This  number  furnishes  the  key  to  the  mystery  of  Abraxas,  who  is <br/>symbolic  of  the  365  ^^lons,  or  Spirits  of  the  Days,  gathered  together  in  one  composite  personality. <br/>Abraxas  is  symbolic  of  five  creatures,  and  as  the  circle  of  the  year  actually  consists  of  360  degrees, <br/>each  of  the  emanating  deities  is  one-fifth  of  this  power,  or  72,  one  of  the  most  sacred  numbers  in  the <br/>Old  Testament  of  the  Jews  and  in  their  Qabbalistic  system.  This  same  method  is  used  in  finding  the <br/>numerical  value  of  the  names  of  the  gods  and  goddesses  of  the  Greeks  and  Jews. <br/><br/>All  higher  numbers  can  be  reduced  to  one  of  the  original  ten  numerals,  and  the  10  itself  to  1. <br/>Therefore,  all  groups  of  numbers  resulting  from  the  translation  of  names  of  deities  into  their <br/>numerical  equivalents  have  a  basis  in  one  of  the  first  ten  numbers.  By  this  system,  in  which  the  digits <br/>are  added  together,  666  becomes  6+6+6  or  18,  and  this,  in  turn,  becomes  1+8  or  9.  According  to <br/>Revelation,  144,000  are  to  be  saved.  This  number  becomes  1+4+4+0+0+0,  which  equals  9,  thus <br/>proving  that  both  the  Beast  of  Babylon  and  the  number  of  the  saved  refer  to  man  himself,  whose <br/>symbol  is  the  number  9.  This  system  can  be  used  successfully  with  both  Greek  and  Hebrew  letter <br/>values. <br/><br/>The  original  Pjlihagorean  system  of  numerical  philosophy  contains  nothing  to  justify  the  practice  now <br/>in  vogue  of  changing  the  given  name  or  surname  in  the  hope  of  improving  the  temperament  or <br/>financial  condition  by  altering  the  name  vibrations. <br/><br/>There  is  also  a  system  of  calculation  in  vogue  for  the  English  language,  but  its  accuracy  is  a  matter  of <br/>legitimate  dispute.  It  is  comparatively  modern  and  has  no  relationship  either  to  the  Hebrew <br/>Qabbalistic  system  or  to  the  Greek  procedure.  The  claim  made  by  some  that  it  is  Pythagorean  is  not <br/>supported  by  any  tangible  evidence,  and  there  are  many  reasons  why  such  a  contention  is  untenable. <br/>The  fact  that  Pythagoras  used  10  as  the  basis  of  calculation,  while  this  system  uses  9~an  imperfect <br/>number &#x2014;is  in  itself  almost  conclusive.  Furthermore,  the  arrangement  of  the  Greek  and  Hebrew <br/>letters  does  not  agree  closely  enough  with  the  English  to  permit  the  application  of  the  number <br/>sequences  of  one  language  to  the  number  sequences  of  the  others.

The  values  of  the  numbers  are  practically  the  same  as <br/>those  given  by  the  Pythagorean  system. <br/><br/><br/>AN  INTRODUCTION  TO  THE  PYTHAGOREAN  THEORY  OF  NUMBERS <br/><br/><br/>(The  following  outline  of  Pythagorean  mathematics  is  a  paraphrase  of  the  opening  chapters  of <br/>Thomas  Taylor's  Theoretic  Arithmetic,  the  rarest  and  most  important  compilation  of  Pythagorean <br/>mathematical  fragments  extant.) <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  declared  arithmetic  to  be  the  mother  of  the  mathematical  sciences.  This  is  proved <br/>by  the  fact  that  geometry,  music,  and  astronomy  are  dependent  upon  it  but  it  is  not  dependent  upon <br/>them.  Thus,  geometry  may  be  removed  but  arithmetic  will  remain;  but  if  arithmetic  be  removed, <br/>geometry  is  eliminated.  In  the  same  manner  music  depends  upon  arithmetic,  but  the  elimination  of <br/>music  affects  arithmetic  only  by  limiting  one  of  its  expressions.  The  Pythagoreans  also  demonstrated <br/>arithmetic  to  be  prior  to  astronomy,  for  the  latter  is  dependent  upon  both  geometry  and  music.  The <br/>size,  form,  and  motion  of  the  celestial  bodies  is  determined  by  the  use  of  geometry;  their  harmony <br/>and  rhythm  by  the  use  of  music.  If  astronomy  be  removed,  neither  geometry  nor  music  is  injured;  but <br/>if  geometry  and  music  be  eliminated,  astronomy  is  destroyed.  The  priority  of  both  geometry  and <br/>music  to  astronomy  is  therefore  established.  Arithmetic,  however,  is  prior  to  all;  it  is  primary  and <br/>fundamental. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  instructed  his  disciples  that  the  science  of  mathematics  is  divided  into  two  major  parts. <br/>The  first  is  concerned  with  the  multitude,  or  the  constituent  parts  of  a  thing,  and  the  second  with  the <br/>magnitude,  or  the  relative  size  or  density  of  a  thing. <br/><br/>Magnitude  is  divided  into  two  parts&#x2014;magnitude  which  is  stationary  and  magnitude  which  is  movable, <br/>the  stationary  pare  having  priority.  Multitude  is  also  divided  into  two  parts,  for  it  is  related  both  to <br/>itself  and  to  other  things,  the  first  relationship  having  priority.  Pythagoras  assigned  the  science  of <br/>arithmetic  to  multitude  related  to  itself,  and  the  art  of  music  to  multitude  related  to  other  things. <br/>Geometry  likewise  was  assigned  to  stationary  magnitude,  and  spherics  (used  partly  in  the  sense  of <br/>astronomy)  to  movable  magnitude.  Both  multitude  and  magnitude  were  circumscribed  by  the <br/>circumference  of  mind.  The  atomic  theory  has  proved  size  to  be  the  result  of  number,  for  a  mass  is <br/>made  up  of  minute  units  though  mistaken  by  the  uninformed  for  a  single  simple  substance. <br/><br/>Owing  to  the  fragmentary  condition  of  existing  Pythagorean  records,  it  is  difficult  to  arrive  at  exact <br/>definitions  of  terms.  Before  it  is  possible,  however,  to  unfold  the  subject  further  some  light  must  he <br/>cast  upon  the  meanings  of  the  words  number,  monad,  and  one. <br/><br/>The  monad  signifies  (a)  the  all-including  ONE.  The  Pythagoreans  called  the  monad  the  &quot;noble <br/>number.  Sire  of  Gods  and  men.&quot;  The  monad  also  signifies  (b)  the  sum  of  any  combination  of  numbers <br/>considered  as  a  whole.  Thus,  the  universe  is  considered  as  a  monad,  but  the  individual  parts  of  the <br/>universe  (such  as  the  planets  and  elements)  are  monads  in  relation  to  the  parts  of  which  they <br/><br/><br/>themselves  are  composed,  though  they,  in  turn,  are  parts  of  the  greater  monad  formed  of  their  sum. <br/><br/>The  monad  may  also  be  likened  (c)  to  the  seed  of  a  tree  which,  when  it  has  grown,  has  many  branches <br/>(the  numbers).  In  other  words,  the  numbers  are  to  the  monad  what  the  branches  of  the  tree  are  to  the <br/>seed  of  the  tree.  From  the  study  of  the  mysterious  Pythagorean  monad,  Leibnitz  evolved  his <br/>magnificent  theory  of  the  world  atoms&#x2014;a  theory  in  perfect  accord  with  the  ancient  teachings  of  the <br/>Mysteries,  for  Leibnitz  himself  was  an  initiate  of  a  secret  school.  By  some  Pythagoreans  the  monad  is <br/>also  considered  (d)  synonymous  with  the  one. <br/><br/>Number  is  the  term  applied  to  all  numerals  and  their  combinations.  (A  strict  interpretation  of  the <br/>term  number  by  certain  of  the  Pythagoreans  excludes  i  and  2.)  Pythagoras  defines  number  to  be  the <br/>extension  and  energy  of  the  spermatic  reasons  contained  in  the  monad.  The  followers  of  Hippasus <br/>declared  number  to  be  the  first  pattern  used  by  the  Demiurgus  in  the  formation  of  the  universe. <br/><br/>The  one  was  defined  by  the  Platonists  as  &quot;the  summit  of  the  many.&quot;  The  one  differs  from  the  monad <br/>in  that  the  term  monad  is  used  to  designate  the  sum  of  the  parts  considered  as  a  unit,  whereas  the  one <br/>is  the  term  applied  to  each  of  its  integral  parts. <br/><br/>There  are  two  orders  of  number:  odd  and  even.  Because  unity,  or  1,  always  remains  indivisible,  the <br/>odd  number  cannot  be  divided  equally.  Thus,  9  is  4+1+4,  the  unity  in  the  center  being  indivisible. <br/>Furthermore,  if  any  odd  number  be  divided  into  two  parts,  one  part  will  always  be  odd  and  the  other <br/>even.  Thus,  9  may  be  5+4,  3+6,  7+2,  or  8+1.  The  Pythagoreans  considered  the  odd  number &#x2014;of  which <br/>the  monad  was  the  prototype&#x2014;to  be  definite  and  masculine.  They  were  not  all  agreed,  however,  as  to <br/>the  nature  of  unity,  or  1.  Some  declared  it  to  be  positive,  because  if  added  to  an  even  (negative) <br/>number,  it  produces  an  odd  (positive)  number.  Others  demonstrated  that  if  unity  be  added  to  an  odd <br/>number,  the  latter  becomes  even,  thereby  making  the  masculine  to  be  feminine.  Unity,  or  1,  therefore, <br/>was  considered  an  androgynous  number,  partaking  of  both  the  masculine  and  the  feminine  attributes; <br/>consequently  both  odd  and  even.  For  this  reason  the  Pythagoreans  called  it  evenly-odd.  It  was <br/>customary  for  the  Pythagoreans  to  offer  sacrifices  of  an  uneven  number  of  objects  to  the  superior <br/>gods,  while  to  the  goddesses  and  subterranean  spirits  an  even  number  was  offered. <br/><br/>Any  even  number  may  be  divided  into  two  equal  parts,  which  are  always  either  both  odd  or  both  even. <br/>Thus,  10  by  equal  division  gives  5+5,  both  odd  numbers.  The  same  principle  holds  true  if  the  10  be <br/>unequally  divided.  For  example,  in  6+4,  both  parts  are  even;  in  7+3,  both  parts  are  odd;  in  8+2,  both <br/>parts  are  again  even;  and  in  9+1,  both  parts  are  again  odd.  Thus,  in  the  even  number,  however  it  may <br/>be  divided,  the  parts  will  always  be  both  odd  or  both  even.  The  Pythagoreans  considered  the  even <br/>number-of  which  the  duad  was  the  prototype&#x2014; to  be  indefinite  and  feminine. <br/><br/>The  odd  numbers  are  divided  by  a  mathematical  contrivance&#x2014; called  &quot;the  Sieve  of  Eratosthenes&quot;&#x2014; into <br/>three  general  classes:  incomposite,  composite,  and  incomposite-composite. <br/><br/>The  incomposite  numbers  are  those  which  have  no  divisor  other  than  themselves  and  unity,  such  as  3, <br/>5,  7, 11, 13, 17, 19,  23,  29,  31, 37, 41, 43,  47,  and  so  forth.  For  example,  7  is  divisible  only  by  7,  which <br/>goes  into  itself  once,  and  unity,  which  goes  into  7  seven  times. <br/><br/>The  composite  numbers  are  those  which  are  divisible  not  only  by  themselves  and  unity  but  also  by <br/>some  other  number,  such  as  9, 15,  21,  25,  27, 33,  39,  45,  51,  57,  and  so  forth.  For  example,  21  is <br/>divisible  not  only  by  itself  and  by  unity,  but  also  by  3  and  by  7. <br/><br/>The  incomposite-composite  numbers  are  those  which  have  no  common  divisor,  although  each  of  itself <br/>is  capable  of  division,  such  as  9  and  25.  For  example,  9  is  divisible  by  3  and  25  by  5,  but  neither  is <br/>divisible  by  the  divisor  of  the  other;  thus  they  have  no  common  divisor.  Because  they  have  individual <br/>divisors,  they  are  called  composite;  and  because  they  have  no  common  divisor,  they  are  called  in, <br/>composite.  Accordingly,  the  term  incomposite-composite  was  created  to  describe  their  properties. <br/><br/><br/>Even  numbers  are  divided  into  three  classes:  evenly-even,  evenly-odd,  and  oddly-odd. <br/><br/>The  evenly-even  numbers  are  all  in  duple  ratio  from  unity;  thus:  i,  2,  4,  8, 16,  32,  64, 128,  256, 512, <br/>and  1,024.  The  proof  of  the  perfect  evenly-even  number  is  that  it  can  be  halved  and  the  halves  again <br/>halved  back  to  unity,  as  1/2  of  64  =  32;  1/2  of  32  =  16;  1/2  of  16  =  8;  1/2  of  8  =  4;  1/2  of  4  =  2;  1/2  of  2 <br/>=  1;  beyond  unity  it  is  impossible  to  go. <br/><br/>The  evenly-even  numbers  possess  certain  unique  properties.  The  sum  of  any  number  of  terms  but  the <br/>last  term  is  always  equal  to  the  last  term  minus  one.  For  example:  the  sum  of  the  first  and  second <br/>terms  (1+2)  equals  the  third  term  (4)  minus  one;  or,  the  sum  of  the  first,  second,  third,  and  fourth <br/>terms  (1+2+4+8)  equals  the  fifth  term  (16)  minus  one. <br/><br/>In  a  series  of  evenly-even  numbers,  the  first  multiplied  by  the  last  equals  the  last,  the  second <br/>multiplied  by  the  second  from  the  last  equals  the  last,  and  so  on  until  in  an  odd  series  one  number <br/>remains,  which  multiplied  by  itself  equals  the  last  number  of  the  series;  or,  in  an  even  series  two <br/>numbers  remain,  which  multiplied  by  each  other  give  the  last  number  of  the  series.  For  example:  1,  2, <br/>4,  8, 16  is  an  odd  series.  The  first  number  (1)  multiplied  by  the  last  number  (16)  equals  the  last <br/>number  (16).  The  second  number  (2)  multiplied  by  the  second  from  the  last  number  (8)  equals  the <br/>last  number  (16).  Being  an  odd  series,  the  4  is  left  in  the  center,  and  this  multiplied  by  itself  also <br/>equals  the  last  number  (16). <br/><br/>The  evenly-odd  numbers  are  those  which,  when  halved,  are  incapable  of  further  division  by  halving. <br/>They  are  formed  by  taking  the  odd  numbers  in  sequential  order  and  multiplying  them  by  2.  By  this <br/>process  the  odd  numbers  1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11  produce  the  evenly-odd  numbers,  2,  6, 10, 14, 18,  22.  Thus, <br/>every  fourth  number  is  evenly-odd.  Each  of  the  even-odd  numbers  may  be  divided  once,  as  2,  which <br/>becomes  two  I's  and  cannot  be  divided  further;  or  6,  which  becomes  two  3's  and  cannot  be  divided <br/>further. <br/><br/>Another  peculiarity  of  the  evenly-odd  numbers  is  that  if  the  divisor  be  odd  the  quotient  is  always  even, <br/>and  if  the  divisor  be  even  the  quotient  is  always  odd.  For  example:  if  18  be  divided  by  2  (an  even <br/>divisor)  the  quotient  is  9  (an  odd  number);  if  18  be  divided  by  3  (an  odd  divisor)  the  quotient  is  6  (an <br/>even  number). <br/><br/>The  evenly-odd  numbers  are  also  remarkable  in  that  each  term  is  one-half  of  the  sum  of  the  terms  on <br/>either  side  of  it.

Its  use  is <br/>extremely  simple  after  the  theory  has  once  been  mastered.  All  the  odd  numbers  are  first  arranged  in  their  natural  order  as  shown  in  the  second  panel  from  the <br/>bottom,  designated  Odd  Numbers.  It  will  then  be  seen  that  every  third  number  (beginning  with  3)  is  divisible  by  3,  every  fifth  number  (beginning  with  5;)  is  divisible <br/>by  5,  every  seventh  number  (beginning  with  7)  is  divisible  by  7,  every  ninth  number  (beginning  with  9)  is  divisible  by  9,  every  eleventh  number  (beginning  with  11)  is <br/>divisible  by  11,  and  so  on  to  infinity.  This  system  finally  sifts  out  what  the  Pythagoreans  called  the  &quot;incomposite&quot;  numbers,  or  those  having  no  divisor  other  than <br/>themselves  and  unity.  These  will  be  found  in  the  lowest  panel,  designated  Primary  and  Incomposite  Numbers.  In  his  History  of  Mathematics,  David  Eugene  Smith <br/>states  that  Eratosthenes  was  one  of  the  greatest  scholars  of  Alexandria  and  was  called  by  his  admirers  &quot;the  second  Plato.&quot;  Eratosthenes  was  educated  at  Athens,  and <br/>is  renowned  not  only  for  his  sieve  but  for  having  computed,  by  a  very  ingenious  method,  the  circumference  and  diameter  of  the  earth.  His  estimate  of  the  earth's <br/>diameter  was  only  50  miles  less  than  the  polar  diameter  accepted  by  modern  scientists.  This  and  other  mathematical  achievements  of  Eratosthenes,  are  indisputable <br/>evidence  that  in  the  third  century  before  Christ  the  Greeks  not  only  knew  the  earth  to  be  spherical  in  farm  but  could  also  approximate,  with  amazing  accuracy,  its <br/>actual  size  and  distance  from  both  the  sun  and  the  moon.  Aristarchus  of  Samos,  another  great  Greek  astronomer  and  mathematician,  who  lived  about  250  B.C., <br/>established  by  philosophical  deduction  and  a  few  simple  scientific  instruments  that  the  earth  revolved  around  the  sun.  While  Copernicus  actually  believed  himself  to <br/>be  the  discoverer  of  this  fact,  he  but  restated  the  findings  advanced  by  Aristarchus  seventeen  hundred  years  earlier. <br/><br/><br/>lo  is  one-half  of  the  sum  of  6  and  14;  18  is  one-half  the  sum  of  14  and  22;  and  6  is  one-half  the  sum  of <br/>2  and  10. <br/><br/>The  oddly-odd,  or  unevenly-even,  numbers  are  a  compromise  between  the  evenly-even  and  the <br/>evenly-odd  numbers.  Unlike  the  evenly-even,  they  cannot  be  halved  back  to  unity;  and  unlike  the <br/>evenly-odd,  they  are  capable  of  more  than  one  division  by  halving.  The  oddly-odd  numbers  are <br/>formed  by  multiplying  the  evenly-even  numbers  above  2  by  the  odd  numbers  above  one.  The  odd <br/>numbers  above  one  are  3,  5,  7,  9, 11,  and  so  forth.  The  evenly-even  numbers  above  2  are  4,  8, 16, 32, <br/>64,  and  soon.  The  first  odd  number  of  the  series  (3)  multiplied  by  4  (the  first  evenly-even  number  of <br/>the  series)  gives  12,  the  first  oddly-odd  number.  By  multiplying  5,  7,  9, 11,  and  so  forth,  by  4,  oddly- <br/>odd  numbers  are  found.  The  other  oddly-odd  numbers  are  produced  by  multiplying  3,  5,  7,  9, 11,  and <br/>so  forth,  in  turn,  by  the  other  evenly-even  numbers  (8, 16,  32,  64,  and  so  forth).  An  example  of  the <br/>halving  of  the  oddly-odd  number  is  as  follows:  1/2  of  12  =  6;  1/2  of  6  =  3,  which  cannot  be  halved <br/>further  because  the  Pj^hagoreans  did  not  divide  unity. <br/><br/>Even  numbers  are  also  divided  into  three  other  classes:  superperfect,  deficient,  and  perfect. <br/><br/>Superperfect  or  superabundant  numbers  are  such  as  have  the  sum  of  their  fractional  parts  greater <br/>than  themselves.  For  example:  1/2  of  24  =  12;  1/4  =  6;  1/3  =  8;  1/6  =  4;  1/12  =  2;  and  1/24  =  1.  The <br/>sum  of  these  parts  (12+6+8+4+2+1)  is  33,  which  is  in  excess  of  24,  the  original  number. <br/><br/>Deficient  numbers  are  such  as  have  the  sum  of  their  fractional  parts  less  than  themselves.  For <br/>example:  1/2  of  14  =  7;  1/7  =  2;  and  1/14  =  1.  The  sum  of  these  parts  (7+2+1)  is  10,  which  is  less  than <br/>14,  the  original  number. <br/><br/>Perfect  numbers  are  such  as  have  the  sum  of  their  fractional  parts  equal  to  themselves.  For  example: <br/>1/2  of  28  =  14;  1/4  =  7;  1/7  =  4;  1/14  =  2;  and  1/28  =  1.  The  sum  of  these  parts  (14+7+4+2+1)  is  equal <br/>to  28. <br/><br/>The  perfect  numbers  are  extremely  rare.  There  is  only  one  between  1  and  10,  namely,  6;  one  between <br/>10  and  100,  namely,  28;  one  between  100  and  1,000,  namely,  496;  and  one  between  1,000  and <br/>10,000,  namely,  8,128.  The  perfect  numbers  are  found  by  the  following  rule:  The  first  number  of  the <br/>evenly-even  series  of  numbers  (1,  2, 4,  8, 16,  32,  and  so  forth)  is  added  to  the  second  number  of  the <br/>series,  and  if  an  incomposite  number  results  it  is  multiplied  by  the  last  number  of  the  series  of  evenly- <br/>even  numbers  whose  sum  produced  it.  The  product  is  the  first  perfect  number.  For  example:  the  first <br/>and  second  evenly-even  numbers  are  1  and  2.  Their  sum  is  3,  an  incomposite  number.  If  3  be <br/>multiplied  by  2,  the  last  number  of  the  series  of  evenly-even  numbers  used  to  produce  it,  the  product <br/>is  6,  the  first  perfect  number.  If  the  addition  of  the  evenly-even  numbers  does  not  result  in  an <br/>incomposite  number,  the  next  evenly-even  number  of  the  series  must  be  added  until  an  incomposite <br/>number  results.  The  second  perfect  number  is  found  in  the  following  manner:  The  sum  of  the  evenly- <br/>even  numbers  1,  2,  and  4  is  7,  an  incomposite  number.  If  7  be  multiplied  by  4  (the  last  of  the  series  of <br/>evenly-even  numbers  used  to  produce  it)  the  product  is  28,  the  second  perfect  number.  This  method <br/>of  calculation  may  be  continued  to  infinity. <br/><br/>Perfect  numbers  when  multiplied  by  2  produce  superabundant  numbers,  and  when  divided  by  2 <br/>produce  deficient  numbers. <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  evolved  their  philosophy  from  the  science  of  numbers.  The  following  quotation <br/>from  Theoretic  Arithmetic  is  an  excellent  example  of  this  practice: <br/><br/>&quot;Perfect  numbers,  therefore,  are  beautiful  images  of  the  virtues  which  are  certain  media  between <br/>excess  and  defect,  and  are  not  summits,  as  by  some  of  the  ancients  they  were  supposed  to  be.  And  evil <br/>indeed  is  opposed  to  evil,  but  both  are  opposed  to  one  good.  Good,  however,  is  never  opposed  to  good. <br/><br/><br/>but  to  two  evils  at  one  and  the  same  time.  Thus  timidity  is  opposed  to  audacity,  to  both  [of]  which  the <br/><br/>want  of  true  courage  is  common;  but  both  timidity  and  audacity  are  opposed  to  fortitude.  Craft  also  is <br/>opposed  to  fatuity,  to  both  [of]  which  the  want  of  intellect  is  common;  and  both  these  are  opposed  to <br/>prudence.  Thus,  too,  profusion  is  opposed  to  avarice,  to  both  [of]  which  illiberality  is  common;  and <br/>both  these  are  opposed  to  liberality.  And  in  a  similar  manner  in  the  other  virtues;  by  all  [of]  which  it <br/>is  evident  that  perfect  numbers  have  a  great  similitude  to  the  virtues.  But  they  also  resemble  the <br/>virtues  on  another  account;  for  they  are  rarely  found,  as  being  few,  and  they  are  generated  in  a  very <br/>constant  order.  On  the  contrary,  an  infinite  multitude  of  superabundant  and  diminished  numbers <br/>maybe  found,  nor  are  they  disposed  in  any  orderly  series,  nor  generated  from  any  certain  end;  and <br/>hence  they  have  a  great  similitude  to  the  vices,  which  are  numerous,  inordinate,  and  indefinite.&quot; <br/><br/>THE  TABLE  OF  THE  TEN  NUMBERS <br/><br/>(The  following  outline  of  the  Pjfthagorean  numbers  is  a  paraphrase  of  the  writings  of  Nicomachus, <br/>Theon  of  Smyrna,  Proclus,  Porphyry,  Plutarch,  Clement  of  Alexandria,  Aristotle,  and  other  early <br/>authorities.) <br/><br/>Monad&#x2014; i--is  so  called  because  it  remains  always  in  the  same  condition&#x2014;that  is,  separate  from  multitude.  Its  attributes <br/>are  as  follows:  It  is  called  mind,  because  the  mind  is  stable  and  has  preeminence;  hermaphrodism,  because  it  is  both  male <br/>and  female;  odd  and  even,  for  being  added  to  the  even  it  makes  odd,  and  to  the  odd,  even;  God,  because  it  is  the  beginning <br/>and  end  of  all,  but  itself  has  neither  beginning  nor  end;  good,  for  such  is  the  nature  of  God;  the  receptacle  of  matter, <br/>because  it  produces  the  duad,  which  is  essentially  material. <br/><br/>By  the  Pythagoreans  monad  was  called  chaos,  obscurity,  chasm,  Tartarus,  Styx,  abyss,  Lethe,  Atlas,  Axis,  Morpho  (a  name <br/>for  Venus),  and  Tower  or  Throne  of  Jupiter,  because  of  the  great  power  which  abides  in  the  center  of  the  universe  and <br/>controls  the  circular  motion  of  the  planers  about  itself.  Monad  is  also  called  germinal  reason,  because  it  is  the  origin  of  all <br/>the  thoughts  in  the  universe.  Other  names  given  to  it  were:  Apollo,  because  of  its  relation  to  the  sun;  Prometheus,  because <br/>he  brought  man  light;  Pyralios,  one  who  exists  in  fire;  geniture,  because  without  it  no  number  can  exist;  substance, <br/>because  substance  is  primary;  cause  of  truth;  and  constitution  of  symphony:  all  these  because  it  is  the  primordial  one. <br/><br/>Between  greater  and  lesser  the  monad  is  equal;  between  intention  and  remission  it  is  middle;  in  multitude  it  is  mean;  and <br/>in  time  it  is  now,  because <br/><br/>p.  72 <br/><br/>eternity  knows  neither  past  nor  future.  It  is  called  Jupiter,  because  he  is  Father  and  head  of  the  gods;  Vesta,  the  fire  of  the <br/>home,  because  it  is  located  in  the  midst  of  the  universe  and  remains  there  inclining  to  no  side  as  a  dot  in  a  circle;  form, <br/>because  it  circumscribes,  comprehends,  and  terminates;  love,  concord,  and  piety,  because  it  is  indivisible.  Other  symbolic <br/>names  for  the  monad  are  ship,  chariot,  Proteus  (a  god  capable  of  changing  his  form),  Mnemosyne,  and  Polyonymous <br/>(having  many  names). <br/><br/>The  following  symbolic  names  were  given  to  the  duad&#x2014; 2&#x2014; because  it  has  been  divided,  and  is  two  rather  than  one;  and <br/>when  there  are  two,  each  is  opposed  to  the  other:  genius,  evil,  darkness,  inequality,  instability,  movability,  boldness, <br/>fortitude,  contention,  matter,  dissimilarity,  partition  between  multitude  and  monad,  defect,  shapelessness,  indefiniteness, <br/>indeterminate  ness,  harmony,  tolerance,  root,  feet  of  fountain-abounding  idea,  top,  Phanes,  opinion,  fallacy,  alterity, <br/>diffidence,  impulse,  death,  motion,  generation,  mutation,  division,  longitude,  augmentation,  composition,  communion, <br/>misfortune,  sustentation,  imposition,  marriage,  soul,  and  science. <br/><br/>In  his  book,  Numbers,  W.  Wynn  Westcott  says  of  the  duad:  &quot;it  was  called  'Audacity,'  from  its  being  the  earliest  number  to <br/>separate  itself  from  the  Divine  One;  from  the  'Adytum  of  God-nourished  Silence,'  as  the  Chaldean  oracles  say.&quot; <br/><br/>As  the  monad  is  the  father,  so  the  duad  is  the  mother;  therefore,  the  duad  has  certain  points  in  common  with  the <br/>goddesses  Isis,  Rhea  (Jove's  mother),  Phrygia,  Lydia,  Dindymene  (Cybele),  and  Ceres;  Erato  (one  of  the  Muses);  Diana, <br/>because  the  moon  is  forked;  Dictynna,  Venus,  Dione,  Cytherea;  Juno,  because  she  is  both  wife  and  sister  of  Jupiter;  and <br/>Maia,  the  mother  of  Mercury. <br/><br/><br/>while  the  monad  is  the  symbol  of  wisdom,  the  duad  is  the  symbol  of  ignorance,  for  in  it  exists  the  sense  of  separateness&#x2014; <br/>which  sense  is  the  beginning  of  ignorance.  The  duad,  however,  is  also  the  mother  of  wisdom,  for  ignorance&#x2014;out  of  the <br/>nature  of  itself&#x2014;invariably  gives  birth  to  wisdom. <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  revered  the  monad  but  despised  the  duad,  because  it  was  the  symbol  of  polarity.  By  the  power  of  the <br/>duad  the  deep  was  created  in  contradistinction  to  the  heavens.  The  deep  mirrored  the  heavens  and  became  the  symbol  of <br/>illusion,  for  the  below  was  merely  a  reflection  of  the  above.  The  below  was  called  maya,  the  illusion,  the  sea,  the  Great <br/>Void,  and  to  symbolize  it  the  Magi  of  Persia  carried  mirrors.  From  the  duad  arose  disputes  and  contentions,  until  by <br/>bringing  the  monad  between  the  duad,  equilibrium  was  reestablished  by  the  Savior-God,  who  took  upon  Himself  the  form <br/>of  a  number  and  was  crucified  between  two  thieves  for  the  sins  of  men. <br/><br/>The  triad&#x2014; 3&#x2014; is  the  first  number  actually  odd  (monad  not  always  being  considered  a  number).  It  is  the  first  equilibrium  of <br/>unities;  therefore,  Pythagoras  said  that  Apollo  gave  oracles  from  a  tripod,  and  advised  offer  of  libation  three  times.  The <br/>keywords  to  the  qualities  of  the  triad  are  friendship,  peace,  justice,  prudence,  piety,  temperance,  and  virtue.  The  following <br/>deities  partake  of  the  principles  of  the  triad:  Saturn  (ruler  of  time),  Latona,  Cornucopise,  Ophion  (the  great  serpent), <br/>Thetis,  Hecate,  Polyhymnia  (a  Muse),  Pluto,  Triton,  President  of  the  Sea,  Tritogenia,  Achelous,  and  the  Faces,  Furies,  and <br/>Graces.  This  number  is  called  wisdom,  because  men  organize  the  present,  foresee  the  future,  and  benefit  by  the <br/>experiences  of  the  fast.  It  is  cause  of  wisdom  and  understanding.  The  triad  is  the  number  of  knowledge&#x2014; music,  geometry, <br/>and  astronomy,  and  the  science  of  the  celestials  and  terrestrials.  Pythagoras  taught  that  the  cube  of  this  number  had  the <br/>power  of  the  lunar  circle. <br/><br/>The  sacredness  of  the  triad  and  its  symbol&#x2014; the  triangle&#x2014; is  derived  fi-om  the  fact  that  it  is  made  up  of  the  monad  and  the <br/>duad.  The  monad  is  the  symbol  of  the  Divine  Father  and  the  duad  of  the  Great  Mother.  The  triad  being  made  of  these  two <br/>is  therefore  androgynous  and  is  symbolic  of  the  fact  that  God  gave  birth  to  His  worlds  out  of  Himself,  who  in  His  creative <br/>aspect  is  always  symbolized  by  the  triangle.  The  monad  passing  into  the  duad  was  thus  capable  of  becoming  the  parent  of <br/>progeny,  for  the  duad  was  the  womb  of  Mem,  within  which  the  world  was  incubated  and  within  which  it  still  exists  in <br/>embryo. <br/><br/>The  tetrad&#x2014; 4&#x2014; was  esteemed  by  the  Pythagoreans  as  the  primogenial  number,  the  root  of  all  things,  the  fountain  of  Nature <br/>and  the  most  perfect  number.  All  tetrads  are  intellectual;  they  have  an  emergent  order  and  encircle  the  world  as  the <br/>Empyreum  passes  through  it.  Why  the  Pythagoreans  expressed  God  as  a  tetrad  is  explained  in  a  sacred  discourse  ascribed <br/>to  Pythagoras,  wherein  God  is  called  the  Number  of  Numbers.  This  is  because  the  decad,  or  10,  is  composed  of  1,  2, 3,  and <br/>4.  The  number  4  is  symbolic  of  God  because  it  is  symbolic  of  the  first  four  numbers.  Moreover,  the  tetrad  is  the  center  of <br/>the  week,  being  halfway  between  1  and  7.  The  tetrad  is  also  the  first  geometric  solid. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  maintained  that  the  soul  of  man  consists  of  a  tetrad,  the  four  powers  of  the  soul  being  mind,  science,  opinion, <br/>and  sense.  The  tetrad  connects  all  beings,  elements,  numbers,  and  seasons;  nor  can  anything  be  named  which  does  not <br/>depend  upon  the  tetractys.  It  is  the  Cause  and  Maker  of  all  things,  the  intelligible  God,  Author  of  celestial  and  sensible <br/>good,  Plutarch  interprets  this  tetractys,  which  he  said  was  also  called  the  world,  to  be  36,  consisting  of  the  first  four  odd <br/>numbers  added  to  the  first  four  even  numbers,  thus: <br/><br/>1  +  3+5+7  =16 <br/>2+4+6+8  =20 <br/><br/>36 <br/><br/><br/>Keywords  given  to  the  tetrad  are  impetuosity,  strength,  virility,  two-mothered,  and  the  key  keeper  of  Nature,  because  the <br/>universal  constitution  cannot  be  without  it.  It  is  also  called  harmony  and  the  first  profundity.  The  following  deities <br/>partook  of  the  nature  of  the  tetrad:  Hercules,  Mercury,  Vulcan,  Bacchus,  and  Urania  (one  of  the  Muses). <br/><br/>The  triad  represents  the  primary  colors  and  the  major  planets,  while  the  tetrad  represents  the  secondary  colors  and  the <br/>minor  planets.  From  the  first  triangle  come  forth  the  seven  spirits,  symbolized  by  a  triangle  and  a  square.  These  together <br/>form  the  Masonic  apron. <br/><br/>The  pentad&#x2014; 5&#x2014; is  the  union  of  an  odd  and  an  even  number  (3  and  2).  Among  the  Greeks,  the  pentagram  was  a  sacred <br/>symbol  of  light,  health,  and  vitality.  It  also  symbolized  the  fifth  element&#x2014; ether&#x2014; because  it  is  free  from  the  disturbances  of <br/>the  four  lower  elements.  It  is  called  equilibrium,  because  it  divides  the  perfect  number  10  into  two  equal  parts. <br/><br/><br/>The  pentad  is  symbolic  of  Nature,  for,  when  multiphed  by  itself  it  returns  into  itself,  just  as  grains  of  wheat,  starting  in  the <br/>form  of  seed,  pass  through  Nature's  processes  and  reproduce  the  seed  of  the  wheat  as  the  ultimate  form  of  their  own <br/>growth.  Other  numbers  multiplied  by  themselves  produce  other  numbers,  but  only  5  and  6  multiplied  by  themselves <br/>represent  and  retain  their  original  number  as  the  last  figure  in  their  products. <br/><br/>The  pentad  represents  all  the  superior  and  inferior  beings.  It  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  hierophant,  or  the  priest  of <br/>the  Mysteries,  because  of  its  connection  with  the  spiritual  ethers,  by  means  of  which  mystic  development  is  attained. <br/>Keywords  of  the  pentad  are  reconciliation,  alternation,  marriage,  immortality,  cordiality.  Providence,  and  sound.  Among <br/>the  deities  who  partook  of  the  nature  of  the  pentad  were  Pallas,  Nemesis,  Bubastia  (Bast),  Venus,  Androgynia,  Cytherea, <br/>and  the  messengers  of  Jupiter. <br/><br/>The  tetrad  (the  elements)  plus  the  monad  equals  the  pentad.  The  P5^hagoreans  taught  that  the  elements  of  earth,  fire,  air, <br/>and  water  were  permeated  by  a  substance  called  ether&#x2014;the  basis  of  vitality  and  life.  Therefore,  they  chose  the  five-pointed <br/>star,  or  pentagram,  as  the  symbol  of  vitality,  health,  and  interpenetration. <br/><br/>It  was  customary  for  the  philosophers  to  conceal  the  element  of  earth  under  the  symbol  of  a  dragon,  and  many  of  the <br/>heroes  of  antiquity  were  told  to  go  forth  and  slay  the  dragon.  Hence,  they  drove  their  sword  (the  monad)  into  the  body  of <br/>the  dragon  (the  tetrad).  This  resulted  in  the  formation  of  the  pentad,  a  symbol  of  the  victory  of  the  spiritual  nature  over <br/>the  material  nature.  The  four  elements  are  symbolized  in  the  early  Biblical  writings  as  the  four  rivers  that  poured  out  of <br/>Garden  of  Eden.  The  elements  themselves  are  under  the  control  of  the  composite  Cherubim  of  Ezekiel. <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  held  the  hexad~6~to  represent,  as  Clement  of  Alexandria  conceived,  the  creation  of  the  world <br/>according  to  both  the  prophets  and  the  ancient  Mysteries.  It  was  called  by  the  Pythagoreans  the  perfection  of  all  the  parts. <br/>This  number  was  particularly  sacred  to  Orpheus,  and  also  to  the  Fate,  Lachesis,  and  the  Muse,  Thalia.  It  was  called  the <br/>form  of  forms,  the  articulation  of  the  universe,  and  the  maker  of  the  soul. <br/><br/>Among  the  Greeks,  harmony  and  the  soul  were  considered  to  be  similar  in  nature,  because  all  souls  are  harmonic.  The <br/>hexad  is  also  the  symbol  of  marriage,  because  it  is  formed  by  the  union  of  two  triangles,  one  masculine  and  the  other <br/>feminine.  Among  the  keywords  given  to  the  hexad  are:  time,  for  it  is  the  measure  of  duration;  panacea,  because  health  is <br/>equilibrium,  and  the  hexad  is  a  balance  number;  the  world,  because  the  world,  like  the  hexad,  is  often  seen  to  consist  of <br/>contraries  by  harmony;  omnisufficient,  because  its  parts  are  sufficient  for  totality  (3+2  +  1  =  6);  unwearied,  because  it <br/>contains  the  elements  of  immortality. <br/><br/>By  the  Pj^hagoreans  the  heptad~7~was  called  &quot;worthy  of  veneration.&quot;  It  was  held  to  be  the  number  of  religion,  because <br/>man  is  controlled  by  seven  celestial  spirits  to  whom  it  is  proper  for  him  to  make  offerings.  It  was  called  the  number  of  life, <br/>because  it  was  believed  that  human  creatures  born  in  the  seventh  month  of  embryonic  life  usually  lived,  but  those  born  in <br/>the  eighth  month  often  died.  One  author  called  it  the  Motherless  Virgin,  Minerva,  because  it  was  nor  born  of  a  mother  but <br/>out  of  the  crown,  or  the  head  of  the  Father,  the  monad.  Keywords  of  the  heptad  are  fortune,  occasion,  custody,  control, <br/>government,  judgment,  dreams,  voices,  sounds,  and  that  which  leads  all  things  to  their  end.  Deities  whose  attributes  were <br/>expressed  by  the  heptad  were  i^^gis,  Osiris,  Mars,  and  Cleo  (one  of  the  Muses). <br/><br/>Among  many  ancient  nations  the  heptad  is  a  sacred  number.  The  Elohim  of  the  Jews  were  supposedly  seven  in  number. <br/>They  were  the  Spirits  of  the  Dawn,  more  commonly  known  as  the  Archangels  controlling  the  planets.  The  seven <br/>Archangels,  with  the  three  spirits  controlling  the  sun  in  its  threefold  aspect,  constitute  the  10,  the  sacred  Pythagorean <br/>decad.  The  mysterious  Pythagorean  tetractys,  or  four  rows  of  dots,  increasing  from  1  to  4,  was  symbolic  of  the  stages  of <br/>creation.  The  great  Pythagorean  truth  that  all  things  in  Nature  are  regenerated  through  the  decad,  or  10,  is  subtly <br/>preserved  in  Freemasonry  through  these  grips  being  effected  by  the  uniting  of  10  fingers,  five  on  the  hand  of  each  person. <br/><br/>The  3  (spirit,  mind,  and  soul)  descend  into  the  4  (the  world),  the  sum  being  the  7,  or  the  mystic  nature  of  man,  consisting <br/>of  a  threefold  spiritual  body  and  a  fourfold  material  form.  These  are  symbolized  by  the  cube,  which  has  six  surfaces  and  a <br/>mysterious  seventh  point  within.  The  six  surfaces  are  the  directions:  north,  east,  south,  west,  up,  and  down;  or,  front,  back, <br/>right,  left,  above,  and  below;  or  again,  earth,  fire,  air,  water,  spirit,  and  matter.  In  the  midst  of  these  stands  the  1,  which  is <br/>the  upright  figure  of  man,  from  whose  center  in  the  cube  radiate  six  pyramids.  From  this  comes  the  great  occult  axiom: <br/>&quot;The  center  is  the  father  of  the  directions,  the  dimensions,  and  the  distances.&quot; <br/><br/>The  heptad  is  the  number  of  the  law,  because  it  is  the  number  of  the  Makers  of  Cosmic  law,  the  Seven  Spirits  before  the <br/>Throne. <br/><br/>The  ogdoad~8~was  sacred  because  it  was  the  number  of  the  first  cube,  which  form  had  eight  corners,  and  was  the  only <br/>evenly-even  number  under  10  (1-2-4-8-4-2-1).  Thus,  the  8  is  divided  into  two  4's,  each  4  is  divided  into  two  2's,  and  each  2 <br/>is  divided  into  two  I's,  thereby  reestablishing  the  monad.  Among  the  kej^vords  of  the  ogdoad  are  love,  counsel,  prudence. <br/><br/><br/>law,  and  convenience.  Among  the  divinities  partaking  of  its  nature  were  Panarmonia,  Rhea,  Cibele,  Cadmaea,  Dindymene, <br/>Orcia,  Neptune,  Themis,  and  Euterpe  (a  Muse). <br/><br/>The  ogdoad  was  a  mysterious  number  associated  with  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  of  Greece  and  the  Cabiri.  It  was  called  the <br/>little  holy  number.  It  derived  its  form  partly  from  the  twisted  snakes  on  the  Caduceus  of  Hermes  and  partly  from  the <br/>serpentine  motion  of  the  celestial  bodies;  possibly  also  from  the  moon's  nodes. <br/><br/>The  ennead~9~was  the  first  square  of  an  odd  number  (3x3).  It  was  associated  with  failure  and  shortcoming  because  it  fell <br/>short  of  the  perfect  number  10  by  one.  It  was  called  the  called  the  number  of  man,  because  of  the  nine  months  of  his <br/>embryonic  life.  Among  its  keywords  are  ocean  and  horizon,  because  to  the  ancients  these  were  boundless.  The  ennead  is <br/>the  limitless  number  because  there  is  nothing  beyond  it  but  the  infinite  10.  It  was  called  boundary  and  limitation,  because <br/>it  gathered  all  numbers  within  itself.  It  was  called  the  sphere  of  the  air,  because  it  surrounded  the  numbers  as  air <br/>surrounds  the  earth,  Among  the  gods  and  goddesses  who  partook  in  greater  or  less  degree  of  its  nature  were  Prometheus, <br/>Vulcan,  Juno,  the  sister  and  wife  of  Jupiter,  Paean,  and  Aglaia,  Tritogenia,  Curetes,  Proserpine,  Hyperion,  and  Terpsichore <br/>(a  Muse). <br/><br/>The  9  was  looked  upon  as  evil,  because  it  was  an  inverted  6.  According  to  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  it  was  the  number  of <br/>the  spheres  through  which  the  consciousness  passed  on  its  way  to  birth.  Because  of  its  close  resemblance  to  the <br/>spermatozoon,  the  9  has  been  associated  with  germinal  life. <br/><br/>The  decad~io~according  to  the  Pythagoreans,  is  the  greatest  of  numbers,  not  only  because  it  is  the  tetractys  (the  10  dots) <br/>but  because  it  comprehends  all  arithmetic  and  harmonic  proportions.  Pythagoras  said  that  10  is  the  nature  of  number, <br/>because  all  nations  reckon  to  it  and  when  they  arrive  at  it  they  return  to  the  monad.  The  decad  was  called  both  heaven  and <br/>the  world,  because  the  former  includes  the  latter.  Being  a  perfect  number,  the  decad  was  applied  by  the  Pythagoreans  to <br/>those  things  relating  to  age,  power,  faith,  necessity,  and  the  power  of  memory.  It  was  also  called  unwearied,  because,  like <br/>God,  it  was  tireless.  The  P5^hagoreans  divided  the  heavenly  bodies  into  ten  orders.  They  also  stated  that  the  decad <br/>perfected  all  numbers  and  comprehended  within  itself  the  nature  of  odd  and  even,  moved  and  unmoved,  good  and  ill. <br/>They  associated  its  power  with  the  following  deities:  Atlas  (for  it  carried  the  numbers  on  its  shoulders),  Urania, <br/>Mnemosyne,  the  Sun,  Phanes,  and  the  One  God. <br/><br/>The  decimal  system  can  probably  be  traced  back  to  the  time  when  it  was  customary  to  reckon  on  the  fingers,  these  being <br/>among  the  most  primitive  of  calculating  devices  and  still  in  use  among  many  aboriginal  peoples. <br/><br/><br/>p-73 <br/><br/><br/>The  Human  Body  in  Symbolism <br/><br/>THE  oldest,  the  most  profound,  the  most  universal  of  all  symbols  is  the  human  body.  The  Greeks, <br/>Persians,  Egyptians,  and  Hindus  considered  a  philosophical  analysis  of  man's  triune  nature  to  be  an <br/>indispensable  part  of  ethical  and  religious  training.  The  Mysteries  of  every  nation  taught  that  the  laws, <br/>elements,  and  powers  of  the  universe  were  epitomized  in  the  human  constitution;  that  everything <br/>which  existed  outside  of  man  had  its  analogue  within  man.  The  universe,  being  immeasurable  in  its <br/>immensity  and  inconceivable  in  its  profundity,  was  beyond  mortal  estimation.  Even  the  gods <br/>themselves  could  comprehend  but  a  part  of  the  inaccessible  glory  which  was  their  source.  When <br/>temporarily  permeated  with  divine  enthusiasm,  man  may  transcend  for  a  brief  moment  the <br/>limitations  of  his  own  personality  and  behold  in  part  that  celestial  effulgence  in  which  all  creation  is <br/>bathed.  But  even  in  his  periods  of  greatest  illumination  man  is  incapable  of  imprinting  upon  the <br/>substance  of  his  rational  soul  a  perfect  image  of  the  multiform  expression  of  celestial  activity. <br/><br/>Recognizing  the  futility  of  attempting  to  cope  intellectually  with  that  which  transcends  the <br/>comprehension  of  the  rational  faculties,  the  early  philosophers  turned  their  attention  from  the <br/>inconceivable  Divinity  to  man  himself,  with  in  the  narrow  confines  of  whose  nature  they  found <br/>manifested  all  the  mysteries  of  the  external  spheres.  As  the  natural  outgrowth  of  this  practice  there <br/>was  fabricated  a  secret  theological  system  in  which  God  was  considered  as  the  Grand  Man  and, <br/>conversely,  man  as  the  little  god.  Continuing  this  analogy,  the  universe  was  regarded  as  a  man  and, <br/>conversely,  man  as  a  miniature  universe.  The  greater  universe  was  termed  the  Macrocosm&#x2014; the  Great <br/>World  or  Body&#x2014;and  the  Divine  Life  or  spiritual  entity  controlling  its  functions  was  called  the <br/>Macroprosophus.  Man's  body,  or  the  individual  human  universe,  was  termed  the  Microcosm,  and  the <br/>Divine  Life  or  spiritual  entity  controlling  its  functions  was  called  the  Microprosophus.  The  pagan <br/>Mysteries  were  primarily  concerned  with  instructing  neophj^es  in  the  true  relationship  existing <br/>between  the  Macrocosm  and  the  Microcosm&#x2014; in  other  words,  between  God  and  man.  Accordingly, <br/>the  key  to  these  analogies  between  the  organs  and  functions  of  the  Microcosmic  man  and  those  of  the <br/>Macrocosmic  Man  constituted  the  most  prized  possession  of  the  early  initiates. <br/><br/>In  Isis  Unveiled,  H.  P.  Blavatsky  summarizes  the  pagan  concept  of  man  as  follows:  &quot;Man  is  a  little <br/>world&#x2014;a  microcosm  inside  the  great  universe.  Like  a  fetus,  he  is  suspended,  by  all  his  three  spirits,  in <br/>the  matrix  of  the  macrocosmos;  and  while  his  terrestrial  body  is  in  constant  sympathy  with  its  parent <br/>earth,  his  astral  soul  lives  in  unison  with  the  sidereal  anima  mundi.  He  is  in  it,  as  it  is  in  him,  for  the <br/>world-pervading  element  fills  all  space,  and  is  space  itself,  only  shoreless  and  infinite.  As  to  his  third <br/>spirit,  the  divine,  what  is  it  but  an  infinitesimal  ray,  one  of  the  countless  radiations  proceeding <br/>directly  from  the  Highest  Cause&#x2014; the  Spiritual  Light  of  the  World?  This  is  the  trinity  of  organic  and <br/>inorganic  nature&#x2014; the  spiritual  and  the  physical,  which  are  three  in  one,  and  of  which  Proclus  says <br/>that  'The  first  monad  is  the  Eternal  God;  the  second,  eternity;  the  third,  the  paradigm,  or  pattern  of <br/>the  universe;'  the  three  constituting  the  Intelligible  Triad.&quot; <br/><br/>Long  before  the  introduction  of  idolatry  into  religion,  the  early  priests  caused  the  statue  of  a  man  to <br/>be  placed  in  the  sanctuary  of  the  temple.  This  human  figure  symbolized  the  Divine  Power  in  all  its <br/>intricate  manifestations.  Thus  the  priests  of  antiquity  accepted  man  as  their  textbook,  and  through <br/>the  study  of  him  learned  to  understand  the  greater  and  more  abstruse  mysteries  of  the  celestial <br/>scheme  of  which  they  were  a  part.  It  is  not  improbable  that  this  mysterious  figure  standing  over  the <br/>primitive  altars  was  made  in  the  nature  of  a  manikin  and,  like  certain  emblematic  hands  in  the <br/>Mystery  schools,  was  covered  with  either  carved  or  painted  hieroglyphs.  The  statue  may  have  opened, <br/>thus  showing  the  relative  positions  of  the  organs,  bones,  muscles,  nerves,  and  other  parts.  After  ages <br/>of  research,  the  manikin  became  a  mass  of  intricate  hieroglyphs  and  symbolic  figures.  Every  part  had <br/>its  secret  meaning.  The  measurements  formed  a  basic  standard  by  means  of  which  it  was  possible  to <br/><br/><br/>measure  all  parts  of  cosmos.  It  was  a  glorious  composite  emblem  of  all  the  knowledge  possessed  by <br/>the  sages  and  hierophants. <br/><br/>Then  came  the  age  of  idolatry.  The  Mysteries  decayed  from  within.  The  secrets  were  lost  and  none <br/>knew  the  identity  of  the  mysterious  man  who  stood  over  the  altar.  It  was  remembered  only  that  the <br/>figure  was  a  sacred  and  glorious  symbol  of  the  Universal  Power,  and  it:  finally  came  to  be  looked  upon <br/>as  a  god&#x2014;the  One  in  whose  image  man  was  made.  Having  lost  the  knowledge  of  the  purpose  for  which <br/>the  manikin  was  originally  constructed,  the  priests  worshiped  this  effigy  until  at  last  their  lack  of <br/>spiritual  understanding  brought  the  temple  down  in  ruins  about  their  heads  and  the  statue  crumbled <br/>with  the  civilization  that  had  forgotten  its  meaning. <br/><br/>Proceeding  from  this  assumption  of  the  first  theologians  that  man  is  actually  fashioned  in  the  image <br/>of  God,  the  initiated  minds  of  past  ages  erected  the  stupendous  structure  of  theology  upon  the <br/>foundation  of  the  human  body.  The  religious  world  of  today  is  almost  totally  ignorant  of  the  fact  that <br/>the  science  of  biology  is  the  fountainhead  of  its  doctrines  and  tenets.  Many  of  the  codes  and  laws <br/>believed  by  modern  divines  to  have  been  direct  revelations  from  Divinity  are  in  reality  the  fruitage  of <br/>ages  of  patient  delving  into  the  intricacies  of  the  human  constitution  and  the  infinite  wonders <br/>revealed  by  such  a  study. <br/><br/>In  nearly  all  the  sacred  books  of  the  world  can  be  traced  an  anatomical  analogy.  This  is  most  evident <br/>in  their  creation  myths.  Anyone  familiar  with  embryology  and  obstetrics  will  have  no  difficulty  in <br/>recognizing  the  basis  of  the  allegory  concerning  Adam  and  Eve  and  the  Garden  of  Eden,  the  nine <br/>degrees  of  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries,  and  the  Brahmanic  legend  of  Vishnu's  incarnations.  The  story  of <br/>the  Universal  Egg,  the  Scandinavian  myth  of  Ginnungagap  (the  dark  cleft  in  space  in  which  the  seed <br/>of  the  world  is  sown),  and  the  use  of  the  fish  as  the  emblem  of  the  paternal  generative  power&#x2014;all <br/>show  the  true  origin  of  theological  speculation.  The  philosophers  of  antiquity  realized  that  man <br/>himself  was  the  key  to  the  riddle  of  life,  for  he  was  the  living  image  of  the  Divine  Plan,  and  in  future <br/>ages  humanity  also  will  come  to  realize  more  fully  the  solemn  import  of  those  ancient  words:  &quot;The <br/>proper  study  of  mankind  is  man.&quot; <br/><br/>Both  God  and  man  have  a  twofold  constitution,  of  which  the  superior  part  is  invisible  and  the  inferior <br/>visible.  In  both  there  is  also  an  intermediary  sphere,  marking  the  point  where  these  visible  and <br/>invisible  natures  meet.  As  the  spiritual  nature  of  God  controls  His  objective  universal  form-which  is <br/>actually  a  crystallized  idea&#x2014; so  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  is  the  invisible  cause  and  controlling  power <br/>of  his  visible  material  personality.  Thus  it  is  evident  that  the  spirit  of  man  bears  the  same  relationship <br/>to  his  material  body  that  God  bears  to  the  objective  universe.  The  Mysteries  taught  that  spirit,  or  life, <br/>was  anterior  to  form  and  that  what  is  anterior  includes  all  that  is  posterior  to  itself.  Spirit  being <br/>anterior  to  form,  form  is  therefore  included  within  the  realm  of  spirit.  It  is  also  a  popular  statement  or <br/>belief  that  man's  spirit  is  within  his  body.  According  to  the  conclusions  of  philosophy  and  theology, <br/>however,  this  belief  is  erroneous,  for  spirit  first  circumscribes  an  area  and  then  manifests  within  it. <br/>Philosophically  speaking,  form,  being  a  part  of  spirit,  is  within  spirit;  but:  spirit  is  more  than  the  sum <br/>of  form,  As  the  material  nature  of  man  is  therefore  within  the  sum  of  spirit,  so  the  Universal  Nature, <br/>including  the  entire  sidereal  system,  is  within  the  all-pervading  essence  of  God&#x2014; the  Universal  Spirit. <br/><br/>According  to  another  concept  of  the  ancient  wisdom,  all  bodies&#x2014; whether  spiritual  or  material&#x2014; have <br/>three  centers,  called  by  the  Greeks  the  upper  center,  the  middle  center,  and  the  lower  center.  An <br/>apparent  ambiguity  will  here  be  noted.  To  diagram  or  symbolize  adequately  abstract  mental  verities  is <br/>impossible,  for  the  diagrammatic  representation  of  one  aspect  of  metaphysical  relationships  may  be <br/>an  actual  contradiction  of  some  other  aspect.  While  that  which <br/><br/><br/>THE  TETRAGRAMMATON  IN  THE  HUMAN  HEART. <br/><br/><br/>From  Bohme's  LibriApologetici. <br/><br/>The  Tetragrammaton,  or  four-lettered  Name  of  God,  is  here  arranged  as  a  tetractys  within  the  inverted  human  heart. <br/>Beneath,  the  name  Jehovah  is  shown  transformed  into  Jehoshua  by  the  interpolation  of  the  radiant  Hebrew  letter  no.  Shin. <br/>The  drawing  as  a  whole  represents  the  throne  of  God  and  His  hierarchies  within  the  heart  of  man.  In  the  first  book  of  his <br/>LibriApologetici,  Jakob  Bohme  thus  describes  the  meaning  of  the  symbol:  &quot;For  we  men  have  one  book  in  common  which <br/>points  to  God.  Each  has  it  within  himself,  which  is  the  priceless  Name  of  God.  Its  letters  are  the  flames  of  His  love,  which <br/>He  out  of  His  heart  in  the  priceless  Name  of  Jesus  has  revealed  in  us.  Read  these  letters  in  your  hearts  and  spirits  and  you <br/>have  books  enough.  All  the  writings  of  the  children  of  God  direct  you  unto  that  one  book,  for  therein  lie  all  the  treasures  of <br/>wisdom.  *  *  *  This  book  is  Christ  in  you.&quot; <br/><br/>p-74 <br/><br/>is  above  is  generally  considered  superior  in  dignity  and  power,  in  reality  that  which  is  in  the  center  is <br/>superior  and  anterior  to  both  that  which  is  said  to  be  above  and  that  which  is  said  to  be  below. <br/>Therefore,  it  must  be  said  that  the  first&#x2014;which  is  considered  as  being  above&#x2014;is  actually  in  the  center, <br/>while  both  of  the  others  (which  are  said  to  be  either  above  or  below)  are  actually  beneath.  This  point <br/>can  be  further  simplified  if  the  reader  will  consider  above  as  indicating  degree  of  proximity  to  source <br/>and  below  as  indicating  degree  of  distance  from  source,  source  being  posited  in  the  actual  center  and <br/>relative  distance  being  the  various  points  along  the  radii  from  the  center  toward  the  circumference.  In <br/>matters  pertaining  to  philosophy  and  theology,  up  maybe  considered  as  toward  the  center  and  doivn <br/>as  toward  the  circumference.  Center  is  spirit;  circumference  is  matter.  Therefore,  up  is  toward  spirit <br/>along  an  ascending  scale  of  spirituality;  down  is  toward  matter  along  an  ascending  scale  of <br/>materiality.  The  latter  concept  is  partly  expressed  by  the  apex  of  a  cone  which,  when  viewed  from <br/>above,  is  seen  as  a  point  in  the  exact  center  of  the  circumference  formed  by  the  base  of  the  cone. <br/><br/>These  three  universal  centers&#x2014; the  one  above,  the  one  below,  and  the  link  uniting  them-represent <br/>three  suns  or  three  aspects  of  one  sun&#x2014; centers  of  effulgence.  These  also  have  their  analogues  in  the <br/>three  grand  centers  of  the  human  body,  which,  like  the  physical  universe,  is  a  Demiurgic  fabrication. <br/>&quot;The  first  of  these  [suns],&quot;  says  Thomas  Taylor,  &quot;is  analogous  to  light  when  viewed  subsisting  in  its <br/>fountain  the  sun;  the  second  to  the  light  immediately  proceeding  from  the  sun;  and  the  third  to  the <br/>splendour  communicated  to  other  natures  by  this  light.&quot; <br/><br/>Since  the  superior  (or  spiritual)  center  is  in  the  midst  of  the  other  two,  its  analogue  in  the  physical <br/>body  is  the  heart&#x2014; the  most  spiritual  and  mysterious  organ  in  the  human  body.  The  second  center  (or <br/>the  link  between  the  superior  and  inferior  worlds)  is  elevated  to  the  position  of  greatest  physical <br/>dignity&#x2014; the  brain.  The  third  (or  lower)  center  is  relegated  to  the  position  of  least  physical  dignity  but <br/>greatest  physical  importance&#x2014; the  generative  system.  Thus  the  heart  is  symbolically  the  source  of  life; <br/>the  brain  the  link  by  which,  through  rational  intelligence,  life  and  form  are  united;  and  the  generative <br/>system&#x2014; or  infernal  creator&#x2014; the  source  of  that  power  by  which  physical  organisms  are  produced.  The <br/><br/><br/>ideals  and  aspirations  of  the  individual  depend  largely  upon  which  of  these  three  centers  of  power <br/>predominates  in  scope  and  activity  of  expression.  In  the  materialist  the  lower  center  is  the  strongest, <br/>in  the  intellectualist  the  higher  center;  but  in  the  initiate  the  middle  center&#x2014;by  bathing  the  two <br/>extremes  in  a  flood  of  spiritual  effulgence&#x2014;controls  wholesomely  both  the  mind  and  the  body. <br/><br/>As  light  bears  witness  of  life-which  is  its  source-so  the  mind  bears  witness  of  the  spirit,  and  activity  in <br/>a  still  lower  plane  bears  witness  of  intelligence.  Thus  the  mind  bears  witness  of  the  heart,  while  the <br/>generative  system,  in  turn,  bears  witness  of  the  mind.  Accordingly,  the  spiritual  nature  is  most <br/>commonly  symbolized  by  a  heart;  the  intellectual  power  by  an  opened  eye,  symbolizing  the  pineal <br/>gland  or  Cyclopean  eye,  which  is  the  two-faced  Janus  of  the  pagan  Mysteries;  and  the  generative <br/>system  by  a  flower,  a  staff,  a  cup,  or  a  hand. <br/><br/>While  all  the  Mysteries  recognized  the  heart  as  the  center  of  spiritual  consciousness,  they  often <br/>purposely  ignored  this  concept  and  used  the  heart  in  its  exoteric  sense  as  the  symbol  of  the  emotional <br/>nature,  In  this  arrangement  the  generative  center  represented  the  physical  body,  the  heart  the <br/>emotional  body,  and  the  brain  the  mental  body.  The  brain  represented  the  superior  sphere,  but  after <br/>the  initiates  had  passed  through  the  lower  degrees  they  were  instructed  that  the  brain  was  the  proxy <br/>of  the  spiritual  flame  dwelling  in  the  innermost  recesses  of  the  heart.  The  student  of  esotericism <br/>discovers  ere  long  that  the  ancients  often  resorted  to  various  blinds  to  conceal  the  true  interpretations <br/>of  their  Mysteries.  The  substitution  of  the  brain  for  the  heart  was  one  of  these  blinds. <br/><br/>The  three  degrees  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  were,  with  few  exceptions,  given  in  chambers  which <br/>represented  the  three  great  centers  of  the  human  and  Universal  bodies.  If  possible,  the  temple  itself <br/>was  constructed  in  the  form  of  the  human  body.  The  candidate  entered  between  the  feet  and  received <br/>the  highest  degree  in  the  point  corresponding  to  the  brain.  Thus  the  first  degree  was  the  material <br/>mystery  and  its  symbol  was  the  generative  system;  it  raised  the  candidate  through  the  various  degrees <br/>of  concrete  thought.  The  second  degree  was  given  in  the  chamber  corresponding  to  the  heart,  but <br/>represented  the  middle  power  which  was  the  mental  link.  Here  the  candidate  was  initiated  into  the <br/>mysteries  of  abstract  thought  and  lifted  as  high  as  the  mind  was  capable  of  penetrating.  He  then <br/>passed  into  the  third  chamber,  which,  analogous  to  the  brain,  occupied  the  highest  position  in  the <br/>temple  but,  analogous  to  the  heart,  was  of  the  greatest  dignity.  In  the  brain  chamber  the  heart <br/>mystery  was  given.  Here  the  initiate  for  the  first  time  truly  comprehended  the  meaning  of  those <br/>immortal  words:  &quot;As  a  man  thinketh  in  his  heart,  so  is  he.&quot;  As  there  are  seven  hearts  in  the  brain  so <br/>there  are  seven  brains  in  the  heart,  but  this  is  a  matter  of  superphysics  of  which  little  can  be  said  at <br/>the  present  time. <br/><br/>Proclus  writes  on  this  subject  in  the  first  book  of  On  the  Theology  of  Plato:  &quot;Indeed,  Socrates  in  the <br/>(First)  Alcibiades  rightly  observes,  that  the  soul  entering  into  herself  will  behold  all  other  things,  and <br/>deity  itself.  For  verging  to  her  own  union,  and  to  the  centre  of  all  life,  laying  aside  multitude,  and  the <br/>variety  of  the  all  manifold  powers  which  she  contains,  she  ascends  to  the  highest  watch-tower <br/>offerings.  And  as  in  the  most  holy  of  the  mysteries,  they  say,  that  the  mystics  at  first  meet  with  the <br/>multi  form,  and  many-shaped  genera,  which  are  hurled  forth  before  the  gods,  but  on  entering  the <br/>temple,  unmoved,  and  guarded  by  the  mystic  rites,  they  genuinely  receive  in  their  bosom  [heart] <br/>divine  illumination,  and  divested  of  their  garments,  as  they  would  say,  participate  of  a  divine  nature; <br/>the  same  mode,  as  it  appears  to  me,  takes  place  in  the  speculation  of  wholes.  For  the  soul  when <br/>looking  at  things  posterior  to  herself,  beholds  the  shadows  and  images  of  beings,  but  when  she <br/>converts  herself  to  herself  she  evolves  her  own  essence,  and  the  reasons  which  she  contains.  And  at <br/>first  indeed,  she  only  as  it  were  beholds  herself;  but,  when  she  penetrates  more  profoundly  into  the <br/>knowledge  of  herself,  she  finds  in  herself  both  intellect,  and  the  orders  of  beings.  When  however,  she <br/>proceeds  into  her  interior  recesses,  and  into  the  adytum  as  it  were  of  the  soul,  she  perceives  with  her <br/>eye  closed  [without  the  aid  of  the  lower  mind],  the  genus  of  the  gods,  and  the  unities  of  beings.  For  all <br/>things  are  in  us  psychically,  and  through  this  we  are  naturally  capable  of  knowing  all  things,  by <br/>exciting  the  powers  and  the  images  of  wholes  which  we  contain.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>The  initiates  of  old  warned  their  disciples  that  an  image  is  not  a  reality  but  merely  the  objectification <br/><br/>of  a  subjective  idea.  The  image,  of  the  gods  were  nor  designed  to  be  objects  of  worship  but  were  to  be <br/>regarded  merely  as  emblems  or  reminders  of  invisible  powers  and  principles.  Similarly,  the  body  of <br/>man  must  not  be  considered  as  the  individual  but  only  as  the  house  of  the  individual,  in  the  same <br/>manner  that  the  temple  was  the  House  of  God.  In  a  state  of  grossness  and  perversion  man's  body  is <br/>the  tomb  or  prison  of  a  divine <br/><br/><br/>HAND  DECORATED  WITH  EFFIGIES  OF  JESUS  CHRIST,  THE  VIRGIN  MARY,  AND  THE  TWELVE  APOSTLES. <br/><br/>From  an  old  print,  courtesy  of  Carl  Oscar  Borg. <br/><br/>Upon  the  twelve  phalanges  of  the  fingers,  appear  the  likenesses  of  the  Apostles,  each  bearing  its  own  appropriate  symbol. <br/>In  the  case  of  those  who  suffered  martyrdom  the  symbol  signifies  the  instrument  of  death.  Thus,  the  symbol  of  St.  Andrew <br/>is  a  cross;  of  St.  Thomas,  a  javelin  or  a  builder's  square;  of  St.  James  the  Less,  a  club;  of  St  Philip,  a  cross;  of  St. <br/>Bartholomew,  a  large  knife  or  scimitar;  of  St.  Matthew,  a  sword  or  spear  (sometimes  a  purse);  of  St.  Simon,  a  club  or  saw; <br/>of  St.  Matthias,  an  axe;  and  of  St.  Judas,  a  halbert.  The  Apostles  whose  symbols  do  not  elate  to  their  martyrdom  are  St. <br/>Peter,  who  carries  two  crossed  keys,  one  gold  and  one  silver;  St.  James  the  Great,  who  bears  a  pilgrim's  staff  and  an <br/>escalop  shell;  and  St.  John,  who  holds  a  cup  from  which  the  poison  miraculously  departed  in  the  form  of  a  serpent.  (See <br/>Handbook  of  Christian  Symbolism.)  The  figure  of  Christ  upon  the  second  phalange  of  the  thumb  does  not  follow  the <br/>pagan  system  of  assigning  the  first  Person  of  the  Creative  Triad  to  this  Position.  God  the  Father  should  occupy  the  second <br/>Phalange,  God  the  Son  the  first  phalange,  while  to  God  the  Holy  Spirit  is  assigned  the  base  of  the  thumb.&#x2014;Also,  according <br/>to  the  Philosophic  arrangement,  the  Virgin  should  occupy  the  base  of  the  thumb,  which  is  sacred  to  the  moon. <br/><br/>p-75 <br/><br/>principle;  in  a  state  of  unfoldment  and  regeneration  it  is  the  House  or  Sanctuary  of  the  Deity  by <br/>whose  creative  powers  it  was  fashioned.  &quot;Personality  is  suspended  upon  a  thread  from  the  nature  of <br/>Being,&quot;  declares  the  secret  work.  Man  is  essentially  a  permanent  and  immortal  principle;  only  his <br/><br/><br/>bodies  pass  through  the  cycle  of  birth  and  death.  The  immortal  is  the  reality;  the  mortal  is  the <br/>unreality.  During  each  period  of  earth  life,  reality  thus  dwells  in  unreality,  to  be  liberated  from  it <br/>temporarily  by  death  and  permanently  by  illumination. <br/><br/>While  generally  regarded  as  poljliheists,  the  pagans  gained  this  reputation  not  because  they <br/>worshiped  more  than  one  God  but  rather  because  they  personified  the  attributes  of  this  God,  thereby <br/>creating  a  pantheon  of  posterior  deities  each  manifesting  a  part  of  what  the  One  God  manifested  as  a <br/>whole.  The  various  pantheons  of  ancient  religions  therefore  actually  represent  the  catalogued  and <br/>personified  attributes  of  Deity.  In  this  respect  they  correspond  to  the  hierarchies  of  the  Hebrew <br/>Qabbalists.  All  the  gods  and  goddesses  of  antiquity  consequently  have  their  analogies  in  the  human <br/>body,  as  have  also  the  elements,  planets,  and  constellations  which  were  assigned  as  proper  vehicles <br/>for  these  celestials.  Four  body  centers  are  assigned  to  the  elements,  the  seven  vital  organs  to  the <br/>planets,  the  twelve  principal  parts  and  members  to  the  zodiac,  the  invisible  parts  of  man's  divine <br/>nature  to  various  supermundane  deities,  while  the  hidden  God  was  declared  to  manifest  through  the <br/>marrow  in  the  bones. <br/><br/>It  is  difficult  for  many  to  realize  that  they  are  actual  universes;  that  their  physical  bodies  are  a  visible <br/>nature  through  the  structure  of  which  countless  waves  of  evolving  life  are  unfolding  their  latent <br/>potentialities.  Yet  through  man's  physical  body  not  only  are  a  mineral,  a  plant,  and  an  animal <br/>kingdom  evolving,  but  also  unknown  classifications  and  divisions  of  invisible  spiritual  life,  just  as <br/>cells  are  infinitesimal  units  in  the  structure  of  man,  so  man  is  an  infinitesimal  unit  in  the  structure  of <br/>the  universe.  A  theology  based  upon  the  knowledge  and  appreciation  of  these  relationships  is  as <br/>profoundly  just  as  it  is  profoundly  true. <br/><br/>As  man's  physical  body  has  five  distinct  and  important  extremities&#x2014;two  legs,  two  arms,  and  a  head,  of <br/>which  the  last  governs  the  first  four &#x2014;the  number  5  has  been  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  man.  By  its <br/>four  corners  the  pyramid  symbolizes  the  arms  and  legs,  and  by  its  apex  the  head,  thus  indicating  that <br/>one  rational  power  controls  four  irrational  corners.  The  hands  and  feet  are  used  to  represent  the  four <br/>elements,  of  which  the  two  feet  are  earth  and  water,  and  the  two  hands  fire  and  air.  The  brain  then <br/>symbolizes  the  sacred  fifth  element&#x2014;aether&#x2014;which  controls  and  unites  the  other  four.  If  the  feet  are <br/>placed  together  and  the  arms  outspread,  man  then  symbolizes  the  cross  with  the  rational  intellect  as <br/>the  head  or  upper  limb. <br/><br/>The  fingers  and  toes  also  have  special  significance.  The  toes  represent  the  Ten  Commandments  of  the <br/>physical  law  and  the  fingers  the  Ten  Commandments  of  the  spiritual  law.  The  four  fingers  of  each <br/>hand  represent  the  four  elements  and  the  three  phalanges  of  each  finger  represent  the  divisions  of  the <br/>element,  so  that  in  each  hand  there  are  twelve  parts  to  the  fingers,  which  are  analogous  to  the  signs  of <br/>the  zodiac,  whereas  the  two  phalanges  and  base  of  each  thumb  signify  the  threefold  Deity.  The  first <br/>phalange  corresponds  to  the  creative  aspect,  the  second  to  the  preservative  aspect,  and  the  base  to  the <br/>generative  and  destructive  aspect.  When  the  hands  are  brought  together,  the  result  is  the  twenty-four <br/>Elders  and  the  six  Days  of  Creation. <br/><br/>In  symbolism  the  body  is  divided  vertically  into  halves,  the  right  half  being  considered  as  light  and <br/>the  left  half  as  darkness.  By  those  unacquainted  with  the  true  meanings  of  light  and  darkness  the  light <br/>half  was  denominated  spiritual  and  the  left  half  material.  Light  is  the  symbol  of  objectivity;  darkness <br/>of  subjectivity.  Light  is  a  manifestation  of  life  and  is  therefore  posterior  to  life.  That  which  is  anterior <br/>to  light  is  darkness,  in  which  light  exists  temporarily  but  darkness  permanently.  As  life  precedes  light, <br/>its  only  symbol  is  darkness,  and  darkness  is  considered  as  the  veil  which  must  eternally  conceal  the <br/>true  nature  of  abstract  and  undifferentiated  Being. <br/><br/>In  ancient  times  men  fought  with  their  right  arms  and  defended  the  vital  centers  with  their  left  arms, <br/>on  which  was  carried  the  protecting  shield.  The  right  half  of  the  body  was  regarded  therefore  as <br/>offensive  and  the  left  half  defensive.  For  this  reason  also  the  right  side  of  the  body  was  considered <br/><br/><br/>masculine  and  the  left  side  feminine.  Several  authorities  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  present  prevalent <br/><br/>right-handedness  of  the  race  is  the  outgrowth  of  the  custom  of  holding  the  left  hand  in  restraint  for <br/>defensive  purposes.  Furthermore,  as  the  source  of  Being  is  in  the  primal  darkness  which  preceded <br/>light,  so  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  is  in  the  dark  part  of  his  being,  for  the  heart  is  on  the  left  side. <br/><br/>Among  the  curious  misconceptions  arising  from  the  false  practice  of  associating  darkness  with  evil  is <br/>one  by  which  several  early  nations  used  the  right  hand  for  all  constructive  labors  and  the  left  hand  for <br/>only  those  purposes  termed  unclean  and  unfit  for  the  sight  of  the  gods.  For  the  same  reason  black <br/>magic  was  often  referred  to  as  the  left-hand  path,  and  heaven  was  said  to  be  upon  the  right  and  hell <br/>upon  the  left.  Some  philosophers  further  declared  that  there  were  two  methods  of  writing:  one  from <br/>left  to  right,  which  was  considered  the  exoteric  method;  the  other  from  right  to  left,  which  was <br/>considered  esoteric.  The  exoteric  writing  was  that  which  was  done  out  or  away  from  the  heart,  while <br/>the  esoteric  writing  was  that  which&#x2014;like  the  ancient  Hebrew&#x2014;was  written  toward  the  heart. <br/><br/>The  secret  doctrine  declares  that  every  part  and  member  of  the  body  is  epitomized  in  the  brain  and,  in <br/>turn,  that  all  that  is  in  the  brain  is  epitomized  in  the  heart.  In  symbolism  the  human  head  is <br/>frequently  used  to  represent  intelligence  and  self-knowledge.  As  the  human  body  in  its  entirety  is  the <br/>most  perfect  known  product  of  the  earth's  evolution,  it  was  employed  to  represent  Divinity&#x2014; the <br/>highest  appreciable  state  or  condition.  Artists,  attempting  to  portray  Divinity,  often  show  only  a  hand <br/>emerging  from  an  impenetrable  cloud.  The  cloud  signifies  the  Unknowable  Divinity  concealed  from <br/>man  by  human  limitation.  The  hand  signifies  the  Divine  activity,  the  only  part  of  God  which  is <br/>cognizable  to  the  lower  senses. <br/><br/>The  face  consists  of  a  natural  trinity:  the  eyes  representing  the  spiritual  power  which  comprehends; <br/>the  nostrils  representing  the  preservative  and  vivifying  power;  and  the  mouth  and  ears  representing <br/>the  material  Demiurgic  power  of  the  lower  world.  The  first  sphere  is  eternally  existent  and  is  creative; <br/>the  second  sphere  pertains  to  the  mystery  of  the  creative  breach;  and  the  third  sphere <br/><br/><br/>THE  THREEFOLD  UFE  OF  THE  INNER  MAN. <br/><br/>Redrawn  from  Gichtel's  Theosophia  Practica. <br/><br/>Johann  Georg  Gichtel,  a  profound  Philosopher  and  mystic,  the  most  illumined  of  the  disciples  of  Jakob  Bohme,  secretly <br/>circulated  the  above  diagrams  among  a  small  group  of  devoted  friends  and  students.  Gichtel  republished  the  writings  of <br/>Bohme,  illustrating  them  with  numerous  remarkable  figures.  According  to  Gichtel,  the  diagrams  above,  represent  the <br/>anatomy  of  the  divine  (or  inner)  man,  and  graphically  set  forth  its  condition  during  its  human,  infernal,  and  divine  states. <br/>The  plates  in  the  William  Law  edition  of  Bohme's  works  are  based  apparently  upon  Gichtel's  diagrams,  which  they  follow <br/><br/><br/>in  all  essentials.  Gichtel  gives  no  detailed  description  of  his  figures,  and  the  lettering  on  the  original  diagrams  here <br/>translated  out  of  the  German  is  the  only  clue  to  the  interpretation  of  the  charts. <br/><br/>The  two  end  figures  represent  the  obverse  and  reverse  of  the  same  diagram  and  are  termed  Table  Three.  They  are <br/>&quot;designed  to  show  the  Condition  of  the  whole  Man,  as  to  all  his  three  essential  Parts,  Spirit,  Soul,  and  Body,  in  his <br/>Regenerated  State.&quot;  The  third  figure  from  the  left  is  called  the  Second  Table,  and  sets  forth  &quot;the  Condition  of  Man  in  his <br/>old,  lapsed,  and  corrupted  State;  without  any  respect  to,  or  consideration  of  his  renewing  by  regeneration.&quot;  The  third <br/>figure,  however,  does  not  correspond  with  the  First  Table  of  William  Law.  The  First  Table  presumably  represents  the <br/>condition  of  humanity  before  the  Fall,  but  the  Gichtel  plate  pertains  to  the  third,  or  regenerated,  state  of  mankind. <br/>William  Law  thus  describes  the  purpose  of  the  diagrams,  and  the  symbols  upon  them:  &quot;These  three  tables  are  designed  to <br/>represent  Man  in  his  different  Threefold  State:  the  First  before  his  Fall,  in  Purity,  Dominion,  and  Glory:  the  Second  after <br/>his  Fall,  in  Pollution  and  Perdition:  and  the  Third  in  his  rising  from  the  Fall,  or  on  the  Way  of  regeneration,  in <br/>Sanctification  and  Tendency  to  his  last  Perfection.&quot;  The  student  of  Orientalism  will  immediately  recognize  in  the  symbols <br/>upon  the  figures  the  Hindu  chakras,  or  centers  of  spiritual  force,  the  various  motions  and  aspects  of  which  reveal  the <br/>condition  of  the  disciple's  internal  divine  nature. <br/><br/>p.  76 <br/><br/>to  the  creative  word.  By  the  Word  of  God  the  material  universe  was  fabricated,  and  the  seven  creative <br/>powers,  or  vowel  sounds&#x2014;which  had  been  brought  into  existence  by  the  speaking  of  the  Word- <br/>became  the  seven  Elohim  or  Deities  by  whose  power  and  ministration  the  lower  world  was  organized. <br/>Occasionally  the  Deity  is  symbolized  by  an  eye,  an  ear,  a  nose,  or  a  mouth.  By  the  first,  Divine <br/>awareness  is  signified;  by  the  second.  Divine  interest;  by  the  third.  Divine  vitality;  and  by  the  fourth. <br/>Divine  command. <br/><br/>The  ancients  did  not  believe  that  spirituality  made  men  either  righteous  or  rational,  but  rather  that <br/>righteousness  and  rationality  made  men  spiritual.  The  Mysteries  taught  that  spiritual  illumination <br/>was  attained  only  by  bringing  the  lower  nature  up  to  a  certain  standard  of  efficiency  and  purity.  The <br/>Mysteries  were  therefore  established  for  the  purpose  of  unfolding  the  nature  of  man  according  to <br/>certain  fixed  rules  which,  when  faithfully  followed,  elevated  the  human  consciousness  to  a  point <br/>where  it  was  capable  of  cognizing  its  own  constitution  and  the  true  purpose  of  existence.  This <br/>knowledge  of  how  man's  manifold  constitution  could  be  most  quickly  and  most  completely <br/>regenerated  to  the  point  of  spiritual  illumination  constituted  the  secret,  or  esoteric,  doctrine  of <br/>antiquity.  Certain  apparently  physical  organs  and  centers  are  in  reality  the  veils  or  sheaths  of  spiritual <br/>centers.  What  these  were  and  how  they  could  be  unfolded  was  never  revealed  to  the  unregenerate,  for <br/>the  philosophers  realized  that  once  he  understands  the  complete  working  of  any  system,  a  man  may <br/>accomplish  a  prescribed  end  without  being  qualified  to  manipulate  and  control  the  effects  which  he <br/>has  produced.  For  this  reason  long  periods  of  probation  were  imposed,  so  that  the  knowledge  of  how <br/>to  become  as  the  gods  might  remain  the  sole  possession  of  the  worthy. <br/><br/>Lest  that  knowledge  be  lost,  however,  it  was  concealed  in  allegories  and  myths  which  were <br/>meaningless  to  the  profane  but  self-evident  to  those  acquainted  with  that  theory  of  personal <br/>redemption  which  was  the  foundation  of  philosophical  theology.  Christianity  itself  maybe  cited  as  an <br/>example.  The  entire  New  Testament  is  in  fact  an  ingeniously  concealed  exposition  of  the  secret <br/>processes  of  human  regeneration.  The  characters  so  long  considered  as  historical  men  and  women  are <br/>really  the  personification  of  certain  processes  which  take  place  in  the  human  body  when  man  begins <br/>the  task  of  consciously  liberating  himself  from  the  bondage  of  ignorance  and  death. <br/><br/>The  garments  and  ornamentations  supposedly  worn  by  the  gods  are  also  keys,  for  in  the  Mysteries <br/>clothing  was  considered  as  synonymous  with  form.  The  degree  of  spirituality  or  materiality  of  the <br/>organisms  was  signified  by  the  quality,  beauty,  and  value  of  the  garments  worn.  Man's  physical  body <br/>was  looked  upon  as  the  robe  of  his  spiritual  nature;  consequently,  the  more  developed  were  his  super- <br/>substantial  powers  the  more  glorious  his  apparel.  Of  course,  clothing  was  originally  worn  for <br/>ornamentation  rather  than  protection,  and  such  practice  still  prevails  among  many  primitive  peoples. <br/>The  Mysteries  caught  that  man's  only  lasting  adornments  were  his  virtues  and  worthy  characteristics; <br/><br/><br/>that  he  was  clothed  in  his  own  accompHshments  and  adorned  by  his  attainments.  Thus  the  white  robe <br/>was  symbolic  of  purity,  the  red  robe  of  sacrifice  and  love,  and  the  blue  robe  of  altruism  and  integrity. <br/>Since  the  body  was  said  to  be  the  robe  of  the  spirit,  mental  or  moral  deformities  were  depicted  as <br/>deformities  of  the  body. <br/><br/>Considering  man's  body  as  the  measuring  rule  of  the  universe,  the  philosophers  declared  that  all <br/>things  resemble  in  constitution&#x2014;if  not  in  form&#x2014; the  human  body.  The  Greeks,  for  example,  declared <br/>Delphi  to  be  the  navel  of  the  earth,  for  the  physical  planet  was  looked  upon  as  a  gigantic  human  being <br/>twisted  into  the  form  of  a  ball.  In  contradistinction  to  the  belief  of  Christendom  that  the  earth  is  an <br/>inanimate  thing,  the  pagans  considered  not  only  the  earth  but  also  all  the  sidereal  bodies  as <br/>individual  creatures  possessing  individual  intelligences.  They  even  went  so  far  as  to  view  the  various <br/>kingdoms  of  Nature  as  individual  entities.  The  animal  kingdom,  for  example,  was  looked  upon  as  one <br/>being&#x2014;a  composite  of  all  the  creatures  composing  that  kingdom.  This  prototypic  beast  was  a  mosaic <br/>embodiment  of  all  animal  propensities  and  within  its  nature  the  entire  animal  world  existed  as  the <br/>human  species  exists  within  the  constitution  of  the  prototypic  Adam. <br/><br/>In  the  same  manner,  races,  nations,  tribes,  religions,  states,  communities,  and  cities  were  viewed  as <br/>composite  entities,  each  made  up  of  varying  numbers  of  individual  units.  Every  community  has  an <br/>individuality  which  is  the  sum  of  the  individual  attitudes  of  its  inhabitants.  Every  religion  is  an <br/>individual  whose  body  is  made  up  of  a  hierarchy  and  vast  host  of  individual  worshipers.  The <br/>organization  of  any  religion  represents  its  physical  body,  and  its  individual  members  the  cell  life <br/>making  up  this  organism.  Accordingly,  religions,  races,  and  communities&#x2014; like  individuals&#x2014; pass <br/>through  Shakespeare's  Seven  Ages,  for  the  life  of  man  is  a  standard  by  which  the  perpetuity  of  all <br/>things  is  estimated. <br/><br/>According  to  the  secret  doctrine,  man,  through  the  gradual  refinement  of  his  vehicles  and  the  ever- <br/>increasing  sensitiveness  resulting  from  that  refinement,  is  gradually  overcoming  the  limitations  of <br/>matter  and  is  disentangling  himself  from  his  mortal  coil.  When  humanity  has  completed  its  physical <br/>evolution,  the  empty  shell  of  materiality  left  behind  will  be  used  by  other  life  waves  as  steppingstones <br/>to  their  own  liberation.  The  trend  of  man's  evolutionary  growth  is  ever  toward  his  own  essential <br/>Selfhood.  At  the  point  of  deepest  materialism,  therefore,  man  is  at  the  greatest  distance  from  Himself. <br/>According  to  the  Mystery  teachings,  not  all  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  incarnates  in  matter.  The  spirit <br/>of  man  is  diagrammatically  shown  as  an  equilateral  triangle  with  one  point  downward.  This  lower <br/>point,  which  is  one-third  of  the  spiritual  nature  but  in  comparison  to  the  dignity  of  the  other  two  is <br/>much  less  than  a  third,  descends  into  the  illusion  of  material  existence  for  a  brief  space  of  time.  That <br/>which  never  clothes  itself  in  the  sheath  of  matter  is  the  Hermetic  Anf/iropos&#x2014; the  Overman- <br/>analogous  to  the  Cyclops  or  guardian  daemon  of  the  Greeks,  the  angel  of  Jakob  Bohme,  and  the <br/>Oversoul  of  Emerson,  &quot;that  Unity,  that  Oversoul,  within  which  every  man's  particular  being  is <br/>contained  and  made  one  with  all  other.&quot; <br/><br/>At  birth  only  a  third  part  of  the  Divine  Nature  of  man  temporarily  dissociates  itself  from  its  own <br/>immortality  and  takes  upon  itself  the  dream  of  physical  birth  and  existence,  animating  with  its  own <br/>celestial  enthusiasm  a  vehicle  composed  of  material  elements,  part  of  and  bound  to  the  material <br/>sphere.  At  death  this  incarnated  part  awakens  from  the  dream  of  physical  existence  and  reunites  itself <br/>once  more  with  its  eternal  condition.  This  periodical  descent  of  spirit  into  matter  is  termed  the  wheel <br/>of  life  and  death,  and  the  principles  involved  are  treated  at  length  by  the  philosophers  under  the <br/>subject  of  metempsychosis.  By  initiation  into  the  Mysteries  and  a  certain  process  known  as  operative <br/>theology,  this  law  of  birth  and  death  is  transcended,  and  during  the  course  of  physical  existence  that <br/>part  of  the  spirit  which  is  asleep  in  form  is  awakened  without  the  intervention  of  death&#x2014; the  inevitable <br/>Initiator&#x2014; and  is  consciously  reunited  with  the  Anthropos,  or  the  overshadowing  substance  of  itself. <br/>This  is  at  once  the  primary  purpose  and  the  consummate  achievement  of  the  Mysteries:  that  man <br/>shall  become  aware  of  and  consciously  be  reunited  with  the  divine  source  of  himself  without  tasting  of <br/>physical  dissolution. <br/><br/><br/>THE  DIVINE  TREE  IN  MAN <br/>(reverse) <br/><br/>From  Law's  Figures  of  Jakob  Bohme. <br/><br/>Just  as  the  diagram  representing  the  front  view  of  man  illustrates  his  divine  principles  in  their  regenerated  state,  so  the <br/>back  view  of  the  same  figure  sets  forth  the  inferior,  or  &quot;night,&quot;  condition  of  the  sun.  From  the  Sphere  of  the  Astral  Mind  a <br/>line  ascends  through  the  Sphere  of  reason  into  that  of  the  Senses.  The  Sphere  of  the  Astral  Mind  and  of  the  Senses  are <br/>filled  with  stars  to  signify  the  nocturnal  condition  of  their  natures.  In  the  sphere  of  reason,  the  superior  and  the  inferior <br/>are  reconciled,  Reason  in  the  mortal  man  corresponding  to  Illumined  Understanding  in  the  spiritual  man. <br/><br/><br/>THE  DIVINE  TREE  IN  MAN <br/>(obverse) <br/><br/>From  Law's  Figures  of  Jakob  Bohme. <br/><br/>A  tree  with  its  roots  in  the  heart  rises  from  the  Mirror  of  the  Deity  through  the  Sphere  of  the  Understanding  to  branch <br/>forth  in  the  Sphere  of  the  Senses.  The  roots  and  trunk  of  this  tree  represent  the  divine  nature  of  man  and  may  be  called  his <br/>spirituality;  the  branches  of  the  tree  are  the  separate  parts  of  the  divine  constitution  and  may  be  likened  to  the <br/>individuality;  and  the  leaves&#x2014;because  of  their  ephemeral  nature&#x2014;correspond  to  the  personality,  which  partakes  of  none <br/>of  the  permanence  of  its  divine  source. <br/><br/><br/>The  Hiramic  Legend <br/><br/><br/>p-77 <br/><br/>WHEN  Solomon&#x2014;the  beloved  of  God,  builder  of  the  Everlasting  House,  and  Grand  Master  of  the <br/>Lodge  of  Jerusalem&#x2014;ascended  the  throne  of  his  father  David  he  consecrated  his  life  to  the  erection  of <br/>a  temple  to  God  and  a  palace  for  the  kings  of  Israel.  David's  faithful  friend,  Hiram,  King  of  Tyre, <br/>hearing  that  a  son  of  David  sat  upon  the  throne  of  Israel,  sent  messages  of  congratulation  and  offers <br/>of  assistance  to  the  new  ruler.  In  his  History  of  the  Jews,  Josephus  mentions  that  copies  of  the  letters <br/>passing  between  the  two  kings  were  then  to  be  seen  both  at  Jerusalem  and  at  Tyre.  Despite  Hiram's <br/>lack  of  appreciation  for  the  twenty  cities  of  Galilee  which  Solomon  presented  to  him  upon  the <br/>completion  of  the  temple,  the  two  monarchs  remained  the  best  of  friends.  Both  were  famous  for  their <br/>wit  and  wisdom,  and  when  they  exchanged  letters  each  devised  puzzling  questions  to  test  the  mental <br/>ingenuity  of  the  other.  Solomon  made  an  agreement  with  Hiram  of  Tyre  promising  vast  amounts  of <br/>barley,  wheat,  com,  wine,  and  oil  as  wages  for  the  masons  and  carpenters  from  Tyre  who  were  to <br/>assist  the  Jews  in  the  erection  of  the  temple.  Hiram  also  supplied  cedars  and  other  fine  trees,  which <br/>were  made  into  rafts  and  floated  down  the  sea  to  Joppa,  whence  they  were  taken  inland  by  Solomon's <br/>workmen  to  the  temple  site. <br/><br/>Because  of  his  great  love  for  Solomon,  Hiram  of  Tyre  sent  also  the  Grand  Master  of  the  Dionysiac <br/>Architects,  CHiram  Abiff,  a  Widow's  Son,  who  had  no  equal  among  the  craftsmen  of  the  earth. <br/>CHiram  is  described  as  being  &quot;a  Tyrian  by  birch,  but  of  Israelitish  descent,&quot;  and  &quot;a  second  Bezaleel, <br/>honored  by  his  king  with  the  title  of  Father.&quot;  The  Freemason's  Pocket  Companion  (published  in  1771) <br/>describes  CHiram  as  &quot;the  most  cunning,  skilful  and  curious  workman  that  ever  lived,  whose  abilities <br/>were  not  confined  to  building  alone,  but  extended  to  all  kinds  of  work,  whether  in  gold,  silver,  brass <br/>or  iron;  whether  in  linen,  tapestry,  or  embroidery;  whether  considered  as  an  architect,  statuary  [sic]; <br/>founder  or  designer,  separately  or  together,  he  equally  excelled.  From  his  designs,  and  under  his <br/>direction,  all  the  rich  and  splendid  furniture  of  the  Temple  and  its  several  appendages  were  begun, <br/>carried  on,  and  finished.  Solomon  appointed  him,  in  his  absence,  to  fill  the  chair,  as  Deputy  Grand- <br/>Master;  and  in  his  presence.  Senior  Grand-Warden,  Master  of  work,  and  general  overseer  of  all  artists, <br/>as  well  those  whom  David  had  formerly  procured  from  Tyre  and  Sidon,  as  those  Hiram  should  now <br/>send.&quot;  (Modem  Masonic  writers  differ  as  to  the  accuracy  of  the  last  sentence.) <br/><br/>Although  an  immense  amount  of  labor  was  involved  in  its  construction,  Solomon's  Temple&#x2014; in  the <br/>words  of  George  Oliver&#x2014; &quot;was  only  a  small  building  and  very  inferior  in  point  of  size  to  some  of  our <br/>churches.&quot;  The  number  of  buildings  contiguous  to  it  and  the  vast  treasure  of  gold  and  precious  stones <br/>used  in  its  construction  concentrated  a  great  amount  of  wealth  within  the  temple  area.  In  the  midst  of <br/>the  temple  stood  the  Holy  of  Holies,  sometimes  called  the  Oracle.  It  was  an  exact  cube,  each <br/>dimension  being  twenty  cubits,  and  exemplified  the  influence  of  Egyptian  symbolism.  The  buildings <br/>of  the  temple  group  were  ornamented  with  1,453  columns  of  Parian  marble,  magnificently  sculptured, <br/>and  2,906  pilasters  decorated  with  capitals.  There  was  a  broad  porch  facing  the  east,  and  the  sanctum <br/>sanctorum  was  upon  the  west.  According  to  tradition,  the  various  buildings  and  courtyards  could <br/>hold  in  all  300,000  persons.  Both  the  Sanctuary  and  the  Holy  of  Holies  were  entirely  lined  with  solid <br/>gold  plates  encrusted  with  jewels. <br/><br/>King  Solomon  began  the  building  of  the  temple  in  the  fourth  year  of  his  reign  on  what  would  be, <br/>according  to  modern  calculation,  the  21st  day  of  April,  and  finished  it  in  the  eleventh  year  of  his  reign <br/>on  the  23rd  day  of  October.  The  temple  was  begun  in  the  480th  year  after  the  children  of  Israel  had <br/>passed  the  Red  Sea.  Part  of  the  labor  of  construction  included  the  building  of  an  artificial  foundation <br/>on  the  brow  of  Mount  Moriah.  The  stones  for  the  temple  were  hoisted  from  quarries  directly  beneath <br/>Mount  Moriah  and  were  trued  before  being  brought  to  the  surface.  The  brass  and  golden  ornaments <br/>for  the  temple  were  cast  in  molds  in  the  clay  ground  between  Succoth  and  Zeredatha,  and  the  wooden <br/><br/><br/>parts  were  all  finished  before  they  reached  the  temple  site.  The  building  was  put  together, <br/>consequently,  without  sound  and  without  instruments,  all  its  parts  fitting  exactly  &quot;without  the <br/>hammer  of  contention,  the  axe  of  division,  or  any  tool  of  mischief.&quot; <br/><br/>Anderson's  much-discussed  Constitutions  of  the  Free-Masons,  published  in  London  in  1723,  and <br/>reprinted  by  Benjamin  Franklin  in  Philadelphia  in  1734,  thus  describes  the  division  of  the  laborers <br/>engaged  in  the  building  of  the  Everlasting  House: <br/><br/>&quot;But  Dagon's  Temple,  and  the  finest  structures  of  Tyre  and  Sidon,  could  not  be  compared  with  the <br/>Eternal  God's  Temple  at  Jerusalem,  *  *  *  there  were  employed  about  it  no  less  than  3,600  Princes,  or <br/>Master-Masons,  to  conduct  the  work  according  to  Solomon's  directions,  with  80,000  hewers  of  stone <br/>in  the  mountain,  or  Fellow  Craftsmen,  and  70,000  labourers,  in  all  153,600  besides  the  levy  under <br/>Adoniram  to  work  in  the  mountains  of  Lebanon  by  turns  with  the  Sidonians,  viz.,  30,000,  being  in  all <br/>183,600.&quot;  Daniel  Sickels  gives  3,300  overseers,  instead  of  3,600,  and  lists  the  three  Grand  Masters <br/>separately.  The  same  author  estimates  the  cost  of  the  temple  at  nearly  four  thousand  millions  of <br/>dollars. <br/><br/>The  Masonic  legend  of  the  building  of  Solomon's  Temple  does  not  in  every  particular  parallel  the <br/>Scriptural  version,  especially  in  those  portions  relating  to  CHiram  Abiff.  According  to  the  Biblical <br/>account,  this  Master  workman  returned  to  his  own  country;  in  the  Masonic  allegory  he  is  foully <br/>murdered.  On  this  point  A.  E.  Waite,  in  his  New  Encyclopaedia  of  Freemasonry,  makes  the  following <br/>explanatory  comment: <br/><br/>&quot;The  legend  of  the  Master-Builder  is  the  great  allegory  of  Masonry.  It  happens  that  his  figurative  story <br/>is  grounded  on  the  fact  of  a  personality  mentioned  in  Holy  Scripture,  but  this  historical  background  is <br/>of  the  accidents  and  not  the  essence;  the  significance  is  in  the  allegory  and  not  in  any  point  of  history <br/>which  may  lie  behind  it.&quot; <br/><br/>CHiram,  as  Master  of  the  Builders,  divided  his  workmen  into  three  groups,  which  were  termed <br/>Entered  Apprentices,  Felloiv-Craftsmen,  and  Master  Masons.  To  each  division  he  gave  certain <br/><br/><br/>A  MASONIC  APRON  WITH  SYMBOUC  FIGURES. <br/><br/><br/>From  an  early  hand-painted  Masonic  apron. <br/><br/><br/>while  the  mystic  symboHsm  of  Freemasonry  decrees  that  the  apron  shall  be  a  simple  square  of  white  lambskin  with <br/>appropriate  flap,  Masonic  aprons  are  frequently  decorated  with  curious  and  impressive  figures.  &quot;When  silk  cotton,  or <br/>linen  is  worn,&quot;  writes  Albert  Pike,  &quot;the  symbolism  is  lost.  Nor  is  one  clothed  who  blots,  defaces,  and  desecrates  the  white <br/>surface  with  ornamentation,  figuring,  or  colors  of  any  kind.&quot;  (See  Symbolism.) <br/><br/>To  Mars,  the  ancient  plane  of  cosmic  energy,  the  Atlantean  and  Chaldean  &quot;star  gazers&quot;  assigned  Aries  as  a  diurnal  throne <br/>and  Scorpio  as  a  nocturnal  throne.  Those  not  raised  to  spiritual  life  by  initiation  are  described  as  &quot;dead  from  the  sting  of  a <br/>scorpion,&quot;  for  they  wander  in  the  night  side  of  divine  power.  Through  the  mystery  of  the  Paschal  Lamb,  or  the  attainment <br/>of  the  Golden  Fleece,  these  soul  are  raised  into  the  constructive  day  Power  of  Mars  in  Aries&#x2014;the  symbol  of  the  Creator. <br/><br/>When  worn  over  the  area  related  to  the  animal  passions,  the  pure  lambskin  signifies  the  regeneration  of  the  procreative <br/>forces  and  their  consecration  to  the  service  of  the  Deity.  The  size  of  the  apron,  exclusive  of  the  flap,  makes  it  the  symbol  of <br/>salvation,  for  the  Mysteries  declare  that  it  must  consist  of  144  square  inches. <br/><br/>The  apron  shown  above  contains  a  wealth  of  symbolism:  the  beehive,  emblematic  of  the  Masonic  lodge  itself,  the  trowel, <br/>the  mallet,  and  the  trestleboad;  the  rough  and  trued  ashlars;  the  pyramids  and  hills  of  Lebanon;  the  pillars,  the  Temple, <br/>and  checkerboard  floor;  and  the  blazing  star  and  tools  of  the  Craft.  The  center  of  the  apron  is  occupied  by  the  compass <br/>and  square,  representative  of  the  Macrocosm  an  the  microcosm,  and  the  alternately  black  and  white  serpent  of  astral  light. <br/>Below  is  an  acacia  branch  with  seven  sprigs,  signifying  the  life  Centers  of  the  superior  and  the  inferior  man.  The  skull  and <br/>cross  bones  are  a  continual  reminder  that  the  spiritual  nature  attains  liberation  only  after  the  philosophical  death  of  man's <br/>sensuous  personality. <br/><br/>p.  78 <br/><br/>passwords  and  signs  by  which  their  respective  excellence  could  be  quickly  determined.  While  all  were <br/>classified  according  to  their  merits  some  were  dissatisfied,  for  they  desired  a  more  exalted  position <br/>than  they  were  capable  of  filling.  At  last  three  Fellow-Craftsmen,  more  daring  than  their  companions, <br/>determined  to  force  CHiram  to  reveal  to  them  the  password  of  the  Master's  degree.  Knowing  that <br/>CHiram  always  went  into  the  unfinished  sanctum  sanctorum  at  high  noon  to  pray,  these  ruffians&#x2014; <br/>whose  names  were  Jubela,  Jubelo,  and  Jubelum~lay  in  wait  for  him,  one  at  each  of  the  main  gates  of <br/>the  temple.  CHiram,  about  to  leave  the  temple  by  the  south  gate,  was  suddenly  confronted  by  Jubela <br/>armed  with  a  twenty-four-inch  gauge.  Upon  CHiram's  refusal  to  reveal  the  Master's  Word,  the  ruffian <br/>struck  him  on  the  throat  with  the  rule,  and  the  wounded  Master  then  hastened  to  the  west  gate,  where <br/>Jubelo,  armed  with  a  square,  awaited  him  and  made  a  similar  demand.  Again  CHiram  was  silent,  and <br/>the  second  assassin  struck  him  on  the  breast  with  the  square.  CHiram  thereupon  staggered  to  the  east <br/>gate,  only  to  be  met  there  by  Jubelum  armed  with  a  maul.  When  CHiram,  refused  him  the  Master's <br/>Word,  Jubelum  struck  the  Master  between  the  eyes  with  the  mallet  and  CHiram  fell  dead. <br/><br/>The  body  of  CHiram  was  buried  by  the  murderers  over  the  brow  of  Mount  Moriah  and  a  sprig  of <br/>acacia  placed  upon  the  grave.  The  murderers  then  sought  to  escape  punishment  for  their  crime  by <br/>embarking  for  Ethiopia,  but  the  port  was  closed.  All  three  were  finally  captured,  and  after  admitting <br/>their  guilt  were  duly  executed.  Parties  of  three  were  then  sent  out  by  King  Solomon,  and  one  of  these <br/>groups  discovered  the  newly  made  grave  marked  by  the  evergreen  sprig.  After  the  Entered <br/>Apprentices  and  the  Fellow-Craftsmen  had  failed  to  resurrect  their  Master  from  the  dead  he  was <br/>finally  raised  by  the  Master  Mason  with  the  &quot;strong  grip  of  a  Lion's  Paw.&quot; <br/><br/>To  the  initiated  Builder  the  name  CHiram  Abiffsigmfies  &quot;My  Father,  the  Universal  Spirit,  one  in <br/>essence,  three  in  aspect.&quot;  Thus  the  murdered  Master  is  a  type  of  the  Cosmic  Martyr&#x2014;the  crucified <br/>Spirit  of  Good,  the  dying  god&#x2014; whose  Mystery  is  celebrated  throughout  the  world.  Among  the <br/>manuscripts  of  Dr.  Sigismund  Bastrom,  the  initiated  Rosicrucian,  appears  the  following  extract  from <br/>von  Welling  concerning  the  true  philosophic  nature  of  the  Masonic  CHiram: <br/><br/>&quot;The  original  word  DTn,  CHiram,  is  a  radical  word  consisting  of  three  consonants  &quot;i  n  and  d  i.  e.  Cheth, <br/>Resh  and  Mem.  (1)  n,  Cheth,  signifies  Chamah,  the  Sun's  light,  i.  e.  the  Universal,  invisible,  cold  fire <br/>of  Nature  attracted  by  the  Sun,  manifested  into  light  and  sent  down  to  us  and  to  every  planetary  body <br/>belonging  to  the  solar  system.  (2)  i,  Resh,  signifies  nn  Ruach,  i.  e.  Spirit,  air,  wind,  as  being  the <br/><br/><br/>Vehicle  which  conveys  and  collects  the  light  into  numberless  Foci,  wherein  the  solar  rays  of  light  are <br/>agitated  by  a  circular  motion  and  manifested  in  Heat  and  burning  Fire.  (3)  a,  or  a  Mem,  signifies <br/>majim,  water,  humidity,  but  rather  the  mother  of  water,  i.  e.  Radical  Humidity  or  a  particular  kind  of <br/>condensed  air.  These  three  constitute  the  Universal  Agent  or  fire  of  Nature  in  one  word,  m^n,  CHiram, <br/>not  Hiram.&quot; <br/><br/>Albert  Pike  mentions  several  forms  of  the  name  CHiram:  Khirm,  Khurm,  and  Khur-Om,  the  latter <br/>ending  in  the  sacred  Hindu  monosyllable  OM,  which  may  also  be  extracted  from  the  names  of  the <br/>three  murderers.  Pike  further  relates  the  three  ruffians  to  a  triad  of  stars  in  the  constellation  of  Libra <br/>and  also  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  Chaldean  god  Bal~metamorphosed  into  a  demon  by  the <br/>Jews&#x2014;appears  in  the  name  of  each  of  the  murderers,  Jube/a,  Jube/o,  and  Ju5e/um.  To  interpret  the <br/>Hiramic  legend  requires  familiarity  with  both  the  Pythagorean  and  Qabbalistic  systems  of  numbers <br/>and  letters,  and  also  the  philosophic  and  astronomic  cycles  of  the  Egyptians,  Chaldeans,  and <br/>Brahmins.  For  example,  consider  the  number  33.  The  first  temple  of  Solomon  stood  for  thirty-three <br/>years  in  its  pristine  splendor.  At  the  end  of  that  time  it  was  pillaged  by  the  Egyptian  King  Shishak, <br/>and  finally  (588  B.C.)  it  was  completely  destroyed  by  Nebuchadnezzar  and  the  people  of  Jerusalem <br/>were  led  into  captivity  to  Babylon.  (See  General  History  of  Freemasonry,  by  Robert  Macoy.)  Also <br/>King  David  ruled  for  thirty-three  years  in  Jerusalem;  the  Masonic  Order  is  divided  into  thirty-three <br/>symbolic  degrees;  there  are  thirty-three  segments  in  the  human  spinal  column;  and  Jesus  was <br/>crucified  in  the  thirty-third  year  of  His  life. <br/><br/>The  efforts  made  to  discover  the  origin  of  the  Hiramic  legend  show  that,  while  the  legend  in  its <br/>present  form  is  comparatively  modem,  its  underlying  principles  run  back  to  remotest  antiquity.  It  is <br/>generally  admitted  by  modem  Masonic  scholars  that  the  story  of  the  martyred  CHiram  is  based  upon <br/>the  Egyptian  rites  of  Osiris,  whose  death  and  resurrection  figuratively  portrayed  the  spiritual  death  of <br/>man  and  his  regeneration  through  initiation  into  the  Mysteries.  CHiram  is  also  identified  with <br/>Hermes  through  the  inscription  on  the  Emerald  Table.  From  these  associations  it  is  evident  that <br/>CHiram  is  to  be  considered  as  a  prototype  of  humanity;  in  fact  he  is  Plato's  Idea  (archetype)  of  man. <br/>As  Adam  after  the  Fall  symbolizes  the  Idea  of  human  degeneration,  so  CHiram  through  his <br/>resurrection  symbolizes  the  Idea  of  human  regeneration. <br/><br/>On  the  19th  day  of  March,  1314,  Jacques  de  Molay,  the  last  Grand  Master  of  the  Knights  Templars, <br/>was  burned  on  a  pyre  erected  upon  that  point  of  the  islet  of  the  Seine,  at  Paris,  where  afterwards  was <br/>erected  the  statue  of  King  Henry  IV.  (See  The  Indian  Religions,  by  Hargrave  Jennings.)  &quot;It  is <br/>mentioned  as  a  tradition  in  some  of  the  accounts  of  the  burning,&quot;  writes  Jennings,  &quot;that  Molay,  ere  he <br/>expired,  summoned  Clement,  the  Pope  who  had  pronounced  the  bull  of  abolition  against  the  Order <br/>and  had  condemned  the  Grand  Master  to  the  flames,  to  appear,  within  forty  days,  before  the  Supreme <br/>Eternal  judge,  and  Philip  [the  king]  to  the  same  awful  tribunal  within  the  space  of  a  year.  Both <br/>predictions  were  fulfilled.&quot;  The  close  relationship  between  Freemasonry  and  the  original  Knights <br/>Templars  has  caused  the  story  of  CHiram  to  be  linked  with  the  martyrdom  of  Jacques  de  Molay. <br/>According  to  this  interpretation,  the  three  ruffians  who  cruelly  slew  their  Master  at  the  gates  of  the <br/>temple  because  he  refused  to  reveal  the  secrets  of  his  Order  represent  the  Pope,  the  king,  and  the <br/>executioners.  De  Molay  died  maintaining  his  innocence  and  refusing  to  disclose  the  philosophical  and <br/>magical  arcana  of  the  Templars. <br/><br/>Those  who  have  sought  to  identify  CHiram  with  the  murdered  King  Charles  the  First  conceive  the <br/>Hiramic  legend  to  have  been  invented  for  that  purpose  by  Elias  Ashmole,  a  mystical  philosopher,  who <br/>was  probably  a  member  of  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity.  Charles  was  dethroned  in  1647  and  died  on  the <br/>block  in  1649,  leaving  the  Royalist  party  leaderless.  An  attempt  has  been  made  to  relate  the  term  &quot;the <br/>Sons  of  the  Widow&quot;  (an  appellation  frequently  applied  to  members  of  the  Masonic  Order)  to  this <br/>incident  in  English  history,  for  by  the  murder  of  her  king  England  became  a  Widow  and  all <br/>Englishmen  Widow's  Sons. <br/><br/><br/>To  the  mystic  Christian  Mason,  CHiram.  represents  the  Christ  who  in  three  days  (degrees)  raised  the <br/>temple  of  His  body  from  its  earthly  sepulcher.  His  three  murderers  were  Csesar's  agent  (the  state),  the <br/>Sanhedrin  (the  church),  and  the  incited  populace  (the  mob).  Thus  considered,  CHiram  becomes  the <br/>higher  nature  of  man  and  the  murderers  are  ignorance,  superstition,  and  fear.  The  indwelling  Christ <br/>can  give  expression  to  Himself  in  this  world  only  through  man's  thoughts,  feelings,  and  actions.  Right <br/>thinking,  right  feeling,  and  right  action&#x2014;these  are  three  gates  through  which  the  Christ  power  passes <br/>into  the  material  world,  there  to  labor  in  the  erection  of  the  Temple  of  Universal  Brotherhood. <br/>Ignorance,  superstition,  and  fear  are  three  ruffians  through  whose  agencies  the  Spirit  of  Good  is <br/>murdered  and  a  false  kingdom,  controlled  by  wrong  thinking,  wrong  feeling,  and  wrong  action, <br/>established  in  its  stead.  In  the  material  universe  evil  appears  ever  victorious. <br/><br/>&quot;In  this  sense,&quot;  writes  Daniel  Sickels,  &quot;the  myth  of  the  Tyrian  is  perpetually  repeated  in  the  history  of <br/>human  affairs.  Orpheus  was  murdered,  and  his  body  thrown  into  the  Hebrus;  Socrates  was  made  to <br/>drink  the  hemlock;  and,  in  all  ages,  we  have  seen  Evil  temporarily  triumphant,  and  Virtue  and  Truth <br/>calumniated,  persecuted,  crucified,  and  slain.  But  Eternal  justice  marches  surely  and  swiftly  through <br/>the  world:  the  Typhous,  the  children  of  darkness,  the  plotters  of  crime,  all  the  infinitely  varied  forms <br/>of  evil,  are  swept  into  oblivion;  and  Truth  and  Virtue&#x2014;for  a  time  laid  low&#x2014; come  forth,  clothed  with <br/>diviner  majesty,  and  crowned  with  everlasting  glory!&quot;  (See  General  Ahiman  Rezon.) <br/><br/>If,  as  there  is  ample  reason  to  suspect,  the  modern  Freemasonic  Order  was  profoundly  influenced  by, <br/>if  it  is  not  an  actual  outgrowth  of,  Francis  Bacon's  secret  society,  its  symbolism  is  undoubtedly <br/>permeated  with  Bacon's  two  great  ideals:  universal  education  and  universal  democracy.  The  deadly <br/>enemies  of  universal  education  are  ignorance,  superstition,  and  fear,  by  which  the  human  soul  is  held <br/>in  bondage  to  the  lowest  part  of  its  own  constitution.  The  arrant  enemies  of  universal  democracy  have <br/>ever  been  the  crown,  the  tiara,  and  the  torch.  Thus  CHiram  symbolizes  that  ideal  state  of  spiritual, <br/>intellectual,  and  physical  emancipation  which  has  ever  been  sacrificed  upon  the  altar  of  human <br/>selfishness.  CHiram  is  the  Beautifier  of  the  Eternal  House.  Modern  utilitarianism,  however,  sacrifices <br/>the  beautiful  for  the  practical,  in  the  same  breath  declaring  the  obvious  lie  that  selfishness,  hatred, <br/>and  discord  are  practical. <br/><br/>Dr.  Orville  Ward  Owen  found  a  considerable  part  of  the  first <br/><br/><br/>THE  EMBLEMATIC  HAND  OF  THE  MYSTERIES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/><br/>A  hand  covered  with  numerous  symbols  was  extended  to  the  neophj^es  when  they  entered  into  the  Temple  of  Wisdom.  An <br/>understanding  of  the  embossed  upon  the  surface  of  the  hand  brought  with  it  Divine  power  and  regeneration  Therefore,  by <br/>means  of  these  symbolic  hands  the  candidate  was  said  to  be  raised  from  the  dead. <br/><br/>p-79 <br/><br/>thirty-two  degrees  of  Freemasonic  ritualism  hidden  in  the  text  of  the  First  Shakespeare  Foho. <br/>Masonic  emblems  are  to  be  observed  also  upon  the  title  pages  of  nearly  every  book  published  by <br/>Bacon.  Sir  Francis  Bacon  considered  himself  as  a  living  sacrifice  upon  the  altar  of  human  need;  he <br/>was  obviously  cut  down  in  the  midst  of  his  labors,  and  no  student  of  his  New  Atlantis  can  fail  to <br/>recognize  the  Masonic  symbolism  contained  therein.  According  to  the  observations  of  Joseph  Fort <br/>Newton,  the  Temple  of  Solomon  described  by  Bacon  in  that  Utopian  romance  was  not  a  house  at  all <br/>but  the  name  of  an  ideal  state.  Is  it  not  true  that  the  Temple  of  Freemasonry  is  also  emblematic  of  a <br/>condition  of  society?  While,  as  before  stated,  the  principles  of  the  Hiramic  legend  are  of  the  greatest <br/>antiquity,  it  is  not  impossible  that  its  present  form  may  be  based  upon  incidents  in  the  life  of  Lord <br/>Bacon,  who  passed  through  the  philosophic  death  and  was  raised  in  Germany. <br/><br/>In  an  old  manuscript  appears  the  statement  that  the  Freemasonic  Order  was  formed  by  alchemists <br/>and  Hermetic  philosophers  who  had  banded  themselves  together  to  protect  their  secrets  against  the <br/>infamous  methods  used  by  avaricious  persons  to  wring  from  them  the  secret  of  gold-making.  The  fact <br/>that  the  Hiramic  legend  contains  an  alchemical  formula  gives  credence  to  this  story.  Thus  the <br/>building  of  Solomon's  Temple  represents  the  consummation  of  the  magnum  opus,  which  cannot  be <br/>realized  without  the  assistance  of  CHiram,  the  Universal  Agent.  The  Masonic  Mysteries  teach  the <br/>initiate  how  to  prepare  within  his  own  soul  a  miraculous  powder  of  projection  by  which  it  is  possible <br/>for  him  to  transmute  the  base  lump  of  human  ignorance,  perversion,  and  discord  into  an  ingot  of <br/>spiritual  and  philosophic  gold. <br/><br/>Sufficient  similarity  exists  between  the  Masonic  CHiram  and  the  Kundalini  of  Hindu  mysticism  to <br/>warrant  the  assumption  that  CHiram  may  be  considered  a  symbol  also  of  the  Spirit  Fire  moving <br/>through  the  sixth  ventricle  of  the  spinal  column.  The  exact  science  of  human  regeneration  is  the  Lost <br/>Key  of  Masonry,  for  when  the  Spirit  Fire  is  lifted  up  through  the  thirty-three  degrees,  or  segments  of <br/>the  spinal  column,  and  enters  into  the  domed  chamber  of  the  human  skull,  it  finally  passes  into  the <br/>pituitary  body  (Isis),  where  it  invokes  Ra  (the  pineal  gland)  and  demands  the  Sacred  Name.  Operative <br/>Masonry,  in  the  fullest  meaning  of  that  term,  signifies  the  process  by  which  the  Eye  of  Horus  is <br/>opened.  E.  A.  Wallis  Budge  has  noted  that  in  some  of  the  papyri  illustrating  the  entrance  of  the  souls <br/>of  the  dead  into  the  judgment  hall  of  Osiris  the  deceased  person  has  a  pine  cone  attached  to  the  crown <br/>of  his  head.  The  Greek  mystics  also  carried  a  symbolic  staff,  the  upper  end  being  in  the  form  of  a  pine <br/>cone,  which  was  called  the  thyrsus  of  Bacchus.  In  the  human  brain  there  is  a  tiny  gland  called  the <br/>pineal  body,  which  is  the  sacred  eye  of  the  ancients,  and  corresponds  to  the  third  eye  of  the  Cyclops. <br/>Little  is  known  concerning  the  function  of  the  pineal  body,  which  Descartes  suggested  (more  wisely <br/>than  he  knew)  might  be  the  abode  of  the  spirit  of  man.  As  its  name  signifies,  the  pineal  gland  is  the <br/>sacred  pine  cone  in  man&#x2014;the  eye  single,  which  cannot  be  opened  until  CHiram  (the  Spirit  Fire)  is <br/>raised  through  the  sacred  seals  which  are  called  the  Seven  Churches  in  Asia. <br/><br/>There  is  an  Oriental  painting  which  shows  three  sun  bursts.  One  sunburst  covers  the  head,  in  the <br/>midst  of  which  sits  Brahma  with  four  heads,  his  body  a  mysterious  dark  color.  The  second  sunburst&#x2014; <br/>which  covers  the  heart,  solar  plexus,  and  upper  abdominal  region&#x2014;shows  Vishnu  sitting  in  the <br/>blossom  of  the  lotus  on  a  couch  formed  of  the  coils  of  the  serpent  of  cosmic  motion,  its  seven-hooded <br/>head  forming  a  canopy  over  the  god.  The  third  sunburst  is  over  the  generative  system,  in  the  midst  of <br/>which  sits  Shiva,  his  body  a  grayish  white  and  the  Ganges  River  flowing  out  of  the  crown  of  his  head. <br/>This  painting  was  the  work  of  a  Hindu  mystic  who  spent  many  years  subtly  concealing  great <br/>philosophical  principles  within  these  figures.  The  Christian  legends  could  be  related  also  to  the <br/>human  body  by  the  same  method  as  the  Oriental,  for  the  arcane  meanings  hidden  in  the  teachings  of <br/>both  schools  are  identical. <br/><br/><br/>As  applied  to  Masonry,  the  three  sunbursts  represent  the  gates  of  the  temple  at  which  CHiram  was <br/><br/>struck,  there  being  no  gate  in  the  north  because  the  sun  never  shines  from  the  northern  angle  of  the <br/>heavens.  The  north  is  the  symbol  of  the  physical  because  of  its  relation  to  ice  (crystallized  water)  and <br/>to  the  body  (crystallized  spirit).  In  man  the  light  shines  toward  the  north  but  never  from  it,  because <br/>the  body  has  no  light  of  its  own  but  shines  with  the  reflected  glory  of  the  divine  life-particles <br/>concealed  within  physical  substance.  For  this  reason  the  moon  is  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  man's <br/>physical  nature.  CHiram  is  the  mysterious  fiery,  airy  water  which  must  be  raised  through  the  three <br/>grand  centers  symbolized  by  the  ladder  with  three  rungs  and  the  sunburst  flowers  mentioned  in  the <br/>description  of  the  Hindu  painting.  It  must  also  pass  upward  by  means  of  the  ladder  of  seven  rungs- <br/>the  seven  plexuses  proximate  to  the  spine.  The  nine  segments  of  the  sacrum  and  coccyx  are  pierced  by <br/>ten  foramina,  through  which  pass  the  roots  of  the  Tree  of  Life.  Nine  is  the  sacred  number  of  man,  and <br/>in  the  symbolism  of  the  sacrum  and  coccyx  a  great  mystery  is  concealed.  That  part  of  the  body  from <br/>the  kidneys  downward  was  termed  by  the  early  Qabbalists  the  Land  of  Egypt  into  which  the  children <br/>of  Israel  were  taken  during  the  captivity.  Out  of  Egypt,  Moses  (the  illuminated  mind,  as  his  name <br/>implies)  led  the  tribes  of  Israel  (the  twelve  faculties)  by  raising  the  brazen  serpent  in  the  wilderness <br/>upon  the  symbol  of  the  Tau  cross.  Not  only  CHiram  but  the  god-men  of  nearly  every  pagan  Mystery <br/>ritual  are  personifications  of  the  Spirit  Fire  in  the  human  spinal  cord. <br/><br/>The  astronomical  aspect  of  the  Hiramic  legend  must  not  be  overlooked.  The  tragedy  of  CHiram  is <br/>enacted  annually  by  the  sun  during  its  passage  through  the  signs  of  the  zodiac. <br/><br/>&quot;From  the  journey  of  the  Sun  through  the  twelve  signs,&quot;  writes  Albert  Pike,  &quot;come  the  legend  of  the <br/>twelve  labors  of  Hercules,  and  the  incarnations  of  Vishnu  and  Buddha.  Hence  came  the  legend  of  the <br/>murder  of  Khurum,  representative  of  the  Sun,  by  the  three  Fellow-Crafts,  symbols  of  the  Winter  signs, <br/>Capricornus,  Aquarius,  and  Pisces,  who  assailed  him  at  the  three  gates  of  Heaven  and  slew  him  at  the <br/>Winter  Solstice.  Hence  the  search  for  him  by  the  nine  Fellow-Crafts,  the  other  nine  signs,  his  finding, <br/>burial,  and  resurrection.&quot;  (See  Morals  and  Dogma.) <br/><br/>Other  authors  consider  Libra,  Scorpio,  and  Sagittarius  as  the  three  murderers  of  the  sun,  inasmuch  as <br/>Osiris  was  murdered  by  Typhon,  to  whom  were  assigned  the  thirty  degrees  of  the  constellation  of <br/>Scorpio.  In  the  Christian  Mysteries  also  Judas  signifies  the  Scorpion,  and  the  thirty  pieces  of  silver  for <br/>which  he  betrayed  His  Lord  represent  the  number  of  degrees  in  that  sign.  Having  been  struck  by <br/>Libra  (the  state),  Scorpio  (the  church),  and  Sagittarius  (the  mob),  the  sun  (CHiram)  is  secretly  home <br/>through  the  darkness  by  the  signs  of  Capricorn,  Aquarius,  and  Pisces  and  buried  over  the  brow  of  a <br/>hill  (the  vernal  equinox).  Capricorn  has  for  its  symbol  an  old  man  with  a  scythe  in  his  hand.  This  is <br/>Father  Time&#x2014;a  wayfarer &#x2014;who  is  symbolized  in  Masonry  as  straightening  out  the  ringlets  of  a  young <br/>girl's  hair.  If  the  Weeping  Virgin  be  considered  a  symbol  of  Virgo,  and  Father  Time  with  his  scythe  a <br/>symbol  of  Capricorn,  then  the  interval  of  ninety  degrees  between  these  two  signs  will  be  found  to <br/>correspond  to  that  occupied  by  the  three  murderers.  Esoterically,  the  urn  containing  the  ashes  of <br/>CHiram  represents  the  human  heart.  Saturn,  the  old  man  who  lives  at  the  north  pole,  and  brings  with <br/>him  to  the  children  of  men  a  sprig  of  evergreen  (the  Christmas  tree),  is  familiar  to  the  little  folks <br/>under  the  name  of  Santa  Clous,  for  he  brings  each  winter  the  gift  of  a  new  year. <br/><br/>The  martyred  sun  is  discovered  by  Aries,  a  Fellow-Craftsman,  and  at  the  vernal  equinox  the  process  of <br/>raising  him  begins.  This  is  finally  accomplished  by  the  Lion  of  Judah,  who  in  ancient  times  occupied <br/>the  position  of  the  keystone  of  the  Royal  Arch  of  Heaven.  The  precession  of  the  equinoxes  causes <br/>various  signs  to  play  the  role  of  the  murderers  of  the  sun  during  the  different  ages  of  the  world,  but <br/>the  principle  involved  remains  unchanged.  Such  is  the  cosmic  story  of  CHiram,  the  Universal <br/>Benefactor,  the  Fiery  Architect:  of  the  Divine  House,  who  carries  with  him  to  the  grave  that  Lost <br/>Word  which,  when  spoken,  raises  all  life  to  power  and  glory.  According  to  Christian  mysticism,  when <br/>the  Lost  Word  is  found  it  is  discovered  in  a  stable,  surrounded  by  beasts  and  marked  by  a  star.  &quot;After <br/>the  sun  leaves  Leo,&quot;  writes  Robert  Hewitt  Brown,  &quot;the  days  begin  to  grow  unequivocally  shorter  as  the <br/>sun  declines  toward  the  autumnal  equinox,  to  be  again  slain  by  the  three  autumnal  months,  lie  dead <br/><br/><br/>through  the  three  winter  ones,  and  be  raised  again  by  the  three  vernal  ones.  Each  year  the  great <br/>tragedy  is  repeated,  and  the  glorious  resurrection  takes  place.&quot;  (See  Stellar  Theology  and  Masonic <br/>Astronomy.) <br/><br/>CHiram  is  termed  dead  because  in  the  average  individual  the  cosmic  creative  forces  are  limited  in <br/>their  manifestation  to  purely  physical&#x2014;and  correspondingly  materialistic&#x2014;expression.  Obsessed  by <br/>his  belief  in  the  reality  and  permanence  of  physical  existence,  man  does  not  correlate  the  material <br/>universe  with  the  blank  north  wall  of  the  temple.  As  the  solar  light  symbolically  is  said  to  die  as  it <br/>approaches  the  winter  solstice,  so  the  physical  world  maybe  termed <br/><br/><br/>Crowned  with  a  triple  tower-like  tiara  and  her  form  adorned  with  symbolic  creatures  representative  of  her  spiritual <br/>powers,  Diana  stood  for  the  source  of  that  imperishable  doctrine  which,  flowing  from  the  bosom  of  the  Great <br/>Multimammia,  is  the  spiritual  food  of  those  aspiring  men  and  women  who  have  consecrated  their  lives  to  the <br/>contemplation  of  reality.  As  the  physical  body  of  man  receives  its  nutriment  from  the  Great  Earth  Mother,  so  the  spiritual <br/>nature  of  man  is  fed  from  the  never  failing  fountains  of  Truth  pouring  outward  from  the  invisible  worlds. <br/><br/><br/>the  winter  solstice  of  the  spirit.  Reaching  the  winter  solstice,  the  sun  apparently  stands  still  for  three <br/>days  and  then,  rolling  away  the  stone  of  winter,  begins  its  triumphal  march  north  towards  the <br/>summer  solstice.  The  condition  of  ignorance  may  be  likened  to  the  winter  solstice  of  philosophy; <br/>spiritual  understanding  to  the  summer  solstice.  From  this  point  of  view,  initiation  into  the  Mysteries <br/>becomes  the  vernal  equinox  of  the  spirit,  at  which  time  the  CHiram  in  man  crosses  from  the  realm  of <br/><br/><br/>DIANA  OF  EPHESUS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/><br/>p.  80 <br/><br/><br/>mortality  into  that  of  eternal  life.  The  autumnal  equinox  is  analogous  to  the  mythological /a//  of  man, <br/>at  which  time  the  human  spirit  descended  into  the  realms  of  Hades  by  being  immersed  in  the  illusion <br/>of  terrestrial  existence. <br/><br/>In  An  Essay  on  the  Beautiful,  Plotinus  describes  the  refining  effect  of  beauty  upon  the  unfolding <br/>consciousness  of  man.  Commissioned  to  decorate  the  Everlasting  House,  CHiram  Abiff  is  the <br/>embodiment  of  the  beautifying  principle.  Beauty  is  essential  to  the  natural  unfoldment  of  the  human <br/>soul.  The  Mysteries  held  that  man,  in  part  at  least,  was  the  product  of  his  environment.  Therefore <br/>they  considered  it  imperative  that  every  person  be  surrounded  by  objects  which  would  evoke  the <br/>highest  and  noblest  sentiments.  They  proved  that  it  was  possible  to  produce  beauty  in  life  by <br/>surrounding  life  with  beauty.  They  discovered  that  symmetrical  bodies  were  built  by  souls <br/>continuously  in  the  presence  of  symmetrical  bodies;  that  noble  thoughts  were  produced  by  minds <br/>surrounded  by  examples  of  mental  nobility.  Conversely,  if  a  man  were  forced  to  look  upon  an  ignoble <br/>or  asymmetrical  structure  it  would  arouse  within  him  a  sense  of  ignobility  which  would  provoke  him <br/>to  commit  ignoble  deeds.  If  an  ill-proportioned  building  were  erected  in  the  midst  of  a  city  there <br/>would  be  ill-proportioned  children  born  in  that  community;  and  men  and  women,  gazing  upon  the <br/>asymmetrical  structure,  would  live  inharmonious  lives.  Thoughtful  men  of  antiquity  realized  that <br/>their  great  philosophers  were  the  natural  products  of  the  aesthetic  ideals  of  architecture,  music,  and <br/>art  established  as  the  standards  of  the  cultural  systems  of  the  time. <br/><br/>The  substitution  of  the  discord  of  the  fantastic  for  the  harmony  of  the  beautiful  constitutes  one  of  the <br/>great  tragedies  of  every  civilization.  Not  only  were  the  Savior-Gods  of  the  ancient  world  beautiful,  but <br/>each  performed  a  ministry  of  beauty,  seeking  to  effect  man's  regeneration  by  arousing  within  him  the <br/>love  of  the  beautiful.  A  renaissance  of  the  golden  age  of  fable  can  be  made  possible  only  by  the <br/>elevation  of  beauty  to  its  rightful  dignity  as  the  all-pervading,  idealizing  quality  in  the  religious, <br/>ethical,  sociological,  scientific,  and  political  departments  of  life.  The  Dionysiac  Architects  were <br/>consecrated  to  the  raising  of  their  Master  Spirit&#x2014;Cosmic  Beauty&#x2014;from  the  sepulcher  of  material <br/>ignorance  and  selfishness  by  erecting  buildings  which  were  such  perfect  exemplars  of  symmetry  and <br/>majesty  that  they  were  actually  magical  formulee  by  which  was  evoked  the  spirit  of  the  martyred <br/>Beautifier  entombed  within  a  materialistic  world. <br/><br/>In  the  Masonic  Mysteries  the  triune  spirit  of  man  (the  light  Delta)  is  symbolized  by  the  three  Grand <br/>Masters  of  the  Lodge  of  Jerusalem.  As  God  is  the  pervading  principle  of  three  worlds,  in  each  of  which <br/>He  manifests  as  an  active  principle,  so  the  spirit  of  man,  partaking  of  the  nature  of  Divinity,  dwells <br/>upon  three  planes  of  being:  the  Supreme,  the  Superior,  and  the  Inferior  spheres  of  the  Pythagoreans. <br/>At  the  gate  of  the  Inferior  sphere  (the  underworld,  or  dwelling  place  of  mortal  creatures)  stands  the <br/>guardian  of  Hades&#x2014; the  three&#x2014; headed  dog  Cerberus,  who  is  analogous  to  the  three  murderers  of  the <br/>Hiramic  legend.  According  to  this  symbolic  interpretation  of  the  triune  spirit,  CHiram  is  the  third,  or <br/>incarnating,  part&#x2014; the  Master  Builder  who  through  all  ages  erects  living  temples  of  flesh  and  blood  as <br/>shrines  of  the  Most  High.  CHiram  comes  forth  as  a  flower  and  is  cut  down;  he  dies  at  the  gates  of <br/>matter;  he  is  buried  in  the  elements  of  creation,  but&#x2014; like  Thor&#x2014; he  swings  his  mighty  hammer  in  the <br/>fields  of  space,  sets  the  primordial  atoms  in  motion,  and  establishes  order  out  of  Chaos.  As  the <br/>potentiality  of  cosmic  power  within  each  human  soul,  CHiram  lies  waiting  for  man  by  the  elaborate <br/>ritualism  of  life  to  transmute  potentiality  into  divine  potency.  As  the  sense  perceptions  of  the <br/>individual  increase,  however,  man  gains  ever  greater  control  over  his  various  parts,  and  the  spirit  of <br/>life  within  gradually  attains  freedom.  The  three  murderers  represent  the  laws  of  the  Inferior  world- <br/>birth,  growth,  and  decay&#x2014; which  ever  frustrate  the  plan  of  the  Builder.  To  the  average  individual, <br/>physical  birch  actually  signifies  the  death  of  CHiram,  and  physical  death  the  resurrection  of  CHiram. <br/>To  the  initiate,  however,  the  resurrection  of  the  spiritual  nature  is  accomplished  without  the <br/>intervention  of  physical  death. <br/><br/>The  curious  symbols  found  in  the  base  of  Cleopatra's  Needle  now  standing  in  Central  Park,  New  York, <br/>were  interpreted  as  being  of  first  Masonic  significance  by  S.  A.  Zola,  33&#x00b0;  Past  Grand  Master  of  the <br/><br/><br/>Grand  Lodge  of  Egypt.  Masons'  marks  and  symbols  are  to  be  found  on  the  stones  of  numerous  public <br/>buildings  not  only  in  England  and  on  the  Continent  but  also  in  Asia.  In  his  Indian  Masons'  Marks  of <br/>the  Moghul  Dynasty,  A.  Gorham  describes  scores  of  markings  appearing  on  the  walls  of  buildings <br/>such  as  the  Taj  Mahal,  the  Jama  Masjid,  and  that:  famous  Masonic  structure,  the  Kutab  Minar. <br/>According  to  those  who  regard  Masonry  as  an  outgrowth  of  the  secret  society  of  architects  and <br/>builders  which  for  thousands  of  years  formed  a  caste  of  master  craftsmen,  CHiram  Abiff  was  the <br/>Tyrian  Grand  Master  of  a  world-wide  organization  of  artisans,  with  headquarters  in  Tyre.  Their <br/>philosophy  consisted  of  incorporating  into  the  measurements  and  ornamentation  of  temples,  palaces, <br/>mausoleums,  fortresses,  and  other  public  buildings  their  knowledge  of  the  laws  controlling  the <br/>universe.  Every  initiated  workman  was  given  a  hieroglyphic  with  which  he  marked  the  stones  he <br/>trued  to  show  to  all  posterity  that  he  thus  dedicated  to  the  Supreme  Architect  of  the  Universe  each <br/>perfected  product  of  his  labor.  Concerning  Masons'  marks,  Robert  Freke  Gould  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;It  is  very  remarkable  that  these  marks  are  to  be  found  in  all  countries&#x2014;in  the  chambers  of  the  Great <br/>Pyramid  at  Gizeh,  on  the  underground  walls  of  Jerusalem,  in  Herculaneum  and  Pompeii,  on  Roman <br/>walls  and  Grecian  temples,  in  Hindustan,  Mexico,  Peru,  Asia  Minor&#x2014;as  well  as  on  the  great  ruins  of <br/>England,  France,  Germany,  Scotland,  Italy,  Portugal  and  Spain.&quot;  (See  A  Concise  History  of <br/>Freemasonry.) <br/><br/>From  this  viewpoint  the  story  of  CHiram  may  well  represent  the  incorporation  of  the  divine  secrets  of <br/>architecture  into  the  actual  parts  and  dimensions  of  earthly  buildings.  The  three  degrees  of  the  Craft <br/>bury  the  Grand  Master  (the  Great  Arcanum)  in  the  actual  structure  they  erect,  after  first  having  killed <br/>him  with  the  builders'  tools,  by  reducing  the  dimensionless  Spirit  of  Cosmic  Beauty  to  the  limitations <br/>of  concrete  form.  These  abstract  ideals  of  architecture  can  be  resurrected,  however,  by  the  Master <br/>Mason  who,  by  meditating  upon  the  structure,  releases  therefrom  the  divine  principles  of <br/>architectonic  philosophy  incorporated  or  buried  within  it.  Thus  the  physical  building  is  actually  the <br/>tomb  or  embodiment  of  the  Creative  Ideal  of  which  its  material  dimensions  are  but  the  shadow. <br/><br/>Moreover,  the  Hiramic  legend  may  be  considered  to  embody  the  vicissitudes  of  philosophy  itself.  As <br/>institutions  for  the  dissemination  of  ethical  culture,  the  pagan  Mysteries  were  the  architects  of <br/>civilization.  Their  power  and  dignity  were  personified  in  CHiram  Abiff&#x2014; the  Master  Builder&#x2014; but  they <br/>eventually  fell  a  victim  to  the  onslaughts  of  that  recurrent  trio  of  state,  church,  and  mob.  They  were <br/>desecrated  by  the  state,  jealous  of  their  wealth  and  power;  by  the  early  church,  fearful  of  their  wisdom; <br/>and  by  the  rabble  or  soldiery  incited  by  both  state  and  church.  As  CHiram  when  raised  from  his  grave <br/>whispers  the  Master  Mason's  Word  which  was  lost  through  his  untimely  death,  so  according  to  the <br/>tenets  of  philosophy  the  reestablishment  or  resurrection  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  will  result  in  the <br/>rediscovery  of  that  secret  teaching  without  which  civilization  must  continue  in  a  state  of  spiritual <br/>confusion  and  uncertainty. <br/><br/>When  the  mob  governs,  man  is  ruled  by  ignorance;  when  the  church  governs,  he  is  ruled  by <br/>superstition;  and  when  the  state  governs,  he  is  ruled  by  fear.  Before  men  can  live  together  in  harmony <br/>and  understanding,  ignorance  must  be  transmuted  into  wisdom,  superstition  into  an  illumined  faith, <br/>and  fear  into  love.  Despite  statements  to  the  contrary.  Masonry  is  a  religion  seeking  to  unite  God  and <br/>man  by  elevating  its  initiates  to  that  level  of  consciousness  whereon  they  can  behold  with  clarified <br/>vision  the  workings  of  the  Great  Architect  of  the  Universe.  From  age  to  age  the  vision  of  a  perfect <br/>civilization  is  preserved  as  the  ideal  for  mankind.  In  the  midst  of  that  civilization  shall  stand  a  mighty <br/>university  wherein  both  the  sacred  and  secular  sciences  concerning  the  mysteries  of  life  will  be  freely <br/>taught  to  all  who  will  assume  the  philosophic  life.  Here  creed  and  dogma  will  have  no  place;  the <br/>superficial  will  be  removed  and  only  the  essential  be  preserved.  The  world  will  be  ruled  by  its  most <br/>illumined  minds,  and  each  will  occupy  the  position  for  which  he  is  most  admirably  fitted. <br/><br/>The  great  university  will  be  divided  into  grades,  admission  to  which  will  be  through  preliminary  tests <br/>or  initiations.  Here  mankind  will  be  instructed  in  the  most  sacred,  the  most  secret,  and  the  most <br/><br/><br/>enduring  of  all  Mysteries&#x2014; Symbolism.  Here  the  initiate  will  be  taught  that  every  visible  object,  every <br/>abstract  thought,  every  emotional  reaction  is  but  the  symbol  of  an  eternal  principle.  Here  mankind <br/>will  learn  that  CHiram  (Truth)  lies  buried  in  every  atom  of  Kosmos;  that  every  form  is  a  symbol  and <br/>every  symbol  the  tomb  of  an  eternal  verity.  Through  education&#x2014;spiritual,  mental,  moral,  and <br/>physical&#x2014;man  will  learn  to  release  living  truths  from  their  lifeless  coverings.  The  perfect  government <br/>of  the  earth  must  be  patterned  eventually  after  that  divine  government  by  which  the  universe  is <br/>ordered.  In  that  day  when  perfect  order  is  reestablished,  with  peace  universal  and  good  triumphant, <br/>men  will  no  longer  seek  for  happiness,  for  they  shall  find  it  welling  up  within  themselves.  Dead  hopes, <br/>dead  aspirations,  dead  virtues  shall  rise  from  their  graves,  and  the  Spirit  of  Beauty  and  Goodness <br/>repeatedly  slain  by  ignorant  men  shall  again  be  the  Master  of  Work.  Then  shall  sages  sit  upon  the <br/>seats  of  the  mighty  and  the  gods  walk  with  men. <br/><br/><br/>p.  81 <br/><br/>The  Pythagorean  Theory  of  Music  and <br/><br/>Color <br/><br/>HARMONY  is  a  state  recognized  by  great  philosophers  as  the  immediate  prerequisite  of  beauty.  A <br/>compound  is  termed  beautiful  only  when  its  parts  are  in  harmonious  combination.  The  world  is <br/>called  beautiful  and  its  Creator  is  designated  the  Good  because  good  perforce  must  act  in  conformity <br/>with  its  own  nature;  and  good  acting  according  to  its  own  nature  is  harmony,  because  the  good  which <br/>it  accomplishes  is  harmonious  with  the  good  which  it  is.  Beauty,  therefore,  is  harmony  manifesting  its <br/>own  intrinsic  nature  in  the  world  of  form. <br/><br/>The  universe  is  made  up  of  successive  gradations  of  good,  these  gradations  ascending  from  matter <br/>(which  is  the  least  degree  of  good)  to  spirit  (which  is  the  greatest  degree  of  good).  In  man,  his <br/>superior  nature  is  the  summum  bonum.  It  therefore  follows  that  his  highest  nature  most  readily <br/>cognizes  good  because  the  good  external  to  him  in  the  world  is  in  harmonic  ratio  with  the  good <br/>present  in  his  soul.  What  man  terms  evil  is  therefore,  in  common  with  matter,  merely  the  least  degree <br/>of  its  own  opposite.  The  least  degree  of  good  presupposes  likewise  the  least  degree  of  harmony  and <br/>beauty.  Thus  deformity  (evil)  is  really  the  least  harmonious  combination  of  elements  naturally <br/>harmonic  as  individual  units.  Deformity  is  unnatural,  for,  the  sum  of  all  things  being  the  Good,  it  is <br/>natural  that  all  things  should  partake  of  the  Good  and  be  arranged  in  combinations  that  are <br/>harmonious.  Harmony  is  the  manifesting  expression  of  the  Will  of  the  eternal  Good. <br/><br/>THE  PHILOSOPHY  OF  MUSIC <br/><br/>It  is  highly  probable  that  the  Greek  initiates  gained  their  knowledge  of  the  philosophic  and <br/>therapeutic  aspects  of  music  from  the  Egyptians,  who,  in  turn,  considered  Hermes  the  founder  of  the <br/>art.  According  to  one  legend,  this  god  constructed  the  first  lyre  by  stretching  strings  across  the <br/>concavity  of  a  turtle  shell.  Both  Isis  and  Osiris  were  patrons  of  music  and  poetry.  Plato,  in  describing <br/>the  antiquity  of  these  arts  among  the  Egyptians,  declared  that  songs  and  poetry  had  existed  in  Egypt <br/>for  at  least  ten  thousand  years,  and  that  these  were  of  such  an  exalted  and  inspiring  nature  that  only <br/>gods  or  godlike  men  could  have  composed  them.  In  the  Mysteries  the  lyre  was  regarded  as  the  secret <br/>symbol  of  the  human  constitution,  the  body  of  the  instrument  representing  the  physical  form,  the <br/>strings  the  nerves,  and  the  musician  the  spirit.  Playing  upon  the  nerves,  the  spirit  thus  created  the <br/>harmonies  of  normal  functioning,  which,  however,  became  discords  if  the  nature  of  man  were  defiled. <br/><br/>While  the  early  Chinese,  Hindus,  Persians,  Egyptians,  Israelites,  and  Greeks  employed  both  vocal  and <br/>instrumental  music  in  their  religious  ceremonials,  also  to  complement  their  poetry  and  drama,  it <br/>remained  for  Pythagoras  to  raise  the  art  to  its  true  dignity  by  demonstrating  its  mathematical <br/>foundation.  Although  it  is  said  that  he  himself  was  not  a  musician,  Pythagoras  is  now  generally <br/>credited  with  the  discovery  of  the  diatonic  scale.  Having  first  learned  the  divine  theory  of  music  from <br/>the  priests  of  the  various  Mysteries  into  which  he  had  been  accepted,  Pythagoras  pondered  for  several <br/>years  upon  the  laws  governing  consonance  and  dissonance.  How  he  actually  solved  the  problem  is <br/>unknown,  but  the  following  explanation  has  been  invented. <br/><br/>One  day  while  meditating  upon  the  problem  of  harmony,  Pythagoras  chanced  to  pass  a  brazier's  shop <br/>where  workmen  were  pounding  out  a  piece  of  metal  upon  an  anvil.  By  noting  the  variances  in  pitch <br/>between  the  sounds  made  by  large  hammers  and  those  made  by  smaller  implements,  and  carefully <br/>estimating  the  harmonies  and  discords  resulting  from  combinations  of  these  sounds,  he  gained  his <br/>first  clue  to  the  musical  intervals  of  the  diatonic  scale.  He  entered  the  shop,  and  after  carefully <br/>examining  the  tools  and  making  mental  note  of  their  weights,  returned  to  his  own  house  and <br/><br/><br/>constructed  an  arm  of  wood  so  that  it:  extended  out  from  the  wall  of  his  room.  At  regular  intervals <br/><br/>along  this  arm  he  attached  four  cords,  all  of  like  composition,  size,  and  weight.  To  the  first  of  these  he <br/>attached  a  twelve-pound  weight,  to  the  second  a  nine-pound  weight,  to  the  third  an  eight-pound <br/>weight,  and  to  the  fourth  a  six-pound  weight.  These  different  weights  corresponded  to  the  sizes  of  the <br/>braziers'  hammers. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  thereupon  discovered  that  the  first  and  fourth  strings  when  sounded  together  produced <br/>the  harmonic  interval  of  the  octave,  for  doubling  the  weight  had  the  same  effect  as  halving  the  string. <br/>The  tension  of  the  first  string  being  twice  that  of  the  fourth  string,  their  ratio  was  said  to  be  2:1,  or <br/>duple.  By  similar  experimentation  he  ascertained  that  the  first  and  third  string  produced  the  harmony <br/>of  the  diapente,  or  the  interval  of  the  fifth.  The  tension  of  the  first  string  being  half  again  as  much  as <br/>that  of  the  third  string,  their  ratio  was  said  to  be  3:2,  or  sesquialter.  Likewise  the  second  and  fourth <br/>strings,  having  the  same  ratio  as  the  first  and  third  strings,  yielded  a  diapente  harmony.  Continuing <br/>his  investigation,  Pythagoras  discovered  that  the  first  and  second  strings  produced  the  harmony  of <br/>the  diatessaron,  or  the  interval  of  the  third;  and  the  tension  of  the  first  string  being  a  third  greater <br/>than  that  of  the  second  string,  their  ratio  was  said  to  be  4:3,  or  sesquitercian.  The  third  and  fourth <br/>strings,  having  the  same  ratio  as  the  first  and  second  strings,  produced  another  harmony  of  the <br/>diatessaron.  According  to  lamblichus,  the  second  and  third  strings  had  the  ratio  of  8:9,  or  epogdoan. <br/><br/>The  key  to  harmonic  ratios  is  hidden  in  the  famous  Pythagorean  tetractys,  or  pyramid  of  dots.  The <br/>tetractys  is  made  up  of  the  first  four  numbers~i,  2,  3,  and  4~which  in  their  proportions  reveal  the <br/>intervals  of  the  octave,  the  diapente,  and  the  diatessaron.  While  the  law  of  harmonic  intervals  as  set <br/>forth  above  is  true,  it  has  been  subsequently  proved  that  hammers  striking  metal  in  the  manner <br/><br/><br/>THE  INTERVALS  AND  HARMONIES  OF  THE  SPHERES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Stanley's  The  History  of  Philosophy. <br/><br/>In  the  Pythagorean  concept  of  the  music  of  the  spheres,  the  interval  between  the  earth  and  the  sphere  of  the  fixed  stars <br/>was  considered  to  be  a  diapason&#x2014;the  most  perfect  harmonic  interval.  The  allowing  arrangement  is  most  generally <br/>accepted  for  the  musical  intervals  of  the  planets  between  the  earth  and  the  sphere  of  the  fixed  stars:  From  the  sphere  of <br/>the  earth  to  the  sphere  of  the  moon;  one  tone;  from  the  sphere  of  the  moon  to  that  of  Mercury,  one  half-tone;  from <br/>Mercury  to  Venus,  one-half;  from  Venus  to  the  sun,  one  and  one-half  tones;  from  the  sun  to  Mars,  one  tone;  from  Mars  to <br/>Jupiter,  one-half  tone;  from  Jupiter  to  Saturn,  one-half  tone;  from  Saturn  to  the  fixed  stars,  one-half  tone.  The  sum  of <br/>these  intervals  equals  the  six  whole  tones  of  the  octave. <br/><br/><br/>THE  CONSONANCES  OF  THE  MUNDANE  MONOCHORD. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  De  Musica  Mundana. <br/><br/>This  diagrammatic  sector  represents  the  major  gradations  of  energy  and  substance  between  elemental  earth  and  absolute <br/>unconditioned  force.  Beginning  with  the  superior,  the  fifteen  graduated  spheres  descend  in  the  following  order:  Limitless <br/>and  Eternal  Life;  the  superior,  the  middle,  and  the  inferior  Empyrean;  the  seven  planets;  and  the  four  elements.  Energy  is <br/>symbolized  by  Fludd  as  a  pyramid  with  its  base  upon  the  concave  surface  of  the  superior  Empyrean,  and  substance  as <br/>another  Pyramid  with  its  base  upon  the  convex  surface  of  the  sphere  (not  planet)  of  earth.  These  pyramids  demonstrate <br/>the  relative  proportions  of  energy  and  substance  entering  into  the  composition  of  the  fifteen  planes  of  being.  It  will  be <br/>noted  that  the  ascending  pyramid  of  substance  touches  but  does  not  pierce  the  fifteenth  sphere&#x2014;that  of  Limitless  and <br/>Eternal  Life.  Likewise,  the  descending  pyramid  of  energy  touches  but  does  not  pierce  the  first  sphere&#x2014;the  grossest <br/>condition  of  substance.  The  plane  of  the  sun  is  denominated  the  sphere  of  equality,  for  here  neither  energy  nor  substance <br/>predominate.  The  mundane  monochord  consists  of  a  hypothetical  string  stretched  from  the  base  of  the  pyramid  of  energy <br/>to  the  base  of  the  pyramid  of  substance. <br/><br/>p.  82 <br/><br/>described  will  not  produce  the  various  tones  ascribed  to  them.  In  all  probability,  therefore, <br/>Pythagoras  actually  worked  out  his  theory  of  harmony  from  the  monochord~a  contrivance  consisting <br/>of  a  single  string  stretched  between  two  pegs  and  supplied  with  movable  frets. <br/><br/><br/>To  Pythagoras  music  was  one  of  the  dependencies  of  the  divine  science  of  mathematics,  and  its <br/>harmonies  were  inflexibly  controlled  by  mathematical  proportions.  The  Pythagoreans  averred  that <br/>mathematics  demonstrated  the  exact  method  by  which  the  good  established  and  maintained  its <br/>universe.  Number  therefore  preceded  harmony,  since  it  was  the  immutable  law  that  governs  all <br/>harmonic  proportions.  After  discovering  these  harmonic  ratios,  Pythagoras  gradually  initiated  his <br/>disciples  into  this,  the  supreme  arcanum  of  his  Mysteries.  He  divided  the  multitudinous  parts  of <br/>creation  into  a  vast  number  of  planes  or  spheres,  to  each  of  which  he  assigned  a  tone,  a  harmonic <br/>interval,  a  number,  a  name,  a  color,  and  a  form.  He  then  proceeded  to  prove  the  accuracy  of  his <br/>deductions  by  demonstrating  them  upon  the  different  planes  of  intelligence  and  substance  ranging <br/>from  the  most  abstract  logical  premise  to  the  most  concrete  geometrical  solid.  From  the  common <br/>agreement  of  these  diversified  methods  of  proof  he  established  the  indisputable  existence  of  certain <br/>natural  laws. <br/><br/>Having  once  established  music  as  an  exact  science,  Pythagoras  applied  his  newly  found  law  of <br/>harmonic  intervals  to  all  the  phenomena  of  Nature,  even  going  so  far  as  to  demonstrate  the  harmonic <br/>relationship  of  the  planets,  constellations,  and  elements  to  each  other.  A  notable  example  of  modern <br/>corroboration  of  ancient  philosophical  reaching  is  that  of  the  progression  of  the  elements  according  to <br/>harmonic  ratios.  While  making  a  list  of  the  elements  in  the  ascending  order  of  their  atomic  weights, <br/>John  A.  Newlands  discovered  at  every  eighth  element  a  distinct  repetition  of  properties.  This <br/>discovery  is  known  as  the  law  of  octaves  in  modern  chemistry. <br/><br/>Since  they  held  that  harmony  must  be  determined  not  by  the  sense  perceptions  but  by  reason  and <br/>mathematics,  the  Pythagoreans  called  themselves  Canonics,  as  distinguished  from  musicians  of  the <br/>Harmonic  School,  who  asserted  taste  and  instinct  to  be  the  true  normative  principles  of  harmony. <br/>Recognizing,  however,  the  profound  effect:  of  music  upon  the  senses  and  emotions,  Pythagoras  did <br/>not  hesitate  to  influence  the  mind  and  body  with  what  he  termed  &quot;musical  medicine.&quot; <br/><br/>Pythagoras  evinced  such  a  marked  preference  for  stringed  instruments  that  he  even  went  so  far  as  to <br/>warn  his  disciples  against  allowing  their  ears  to  be  defiled  by  the  sounds  of  flutes  or  cymbals.  He <br/>further  declared  that  the  soul  could  be  purified  from  its  irrational  influences  by  solemn  songs  sung  to <br/>the  accompaniment  of  the  lyre.  In  his  investigation  of  the  therapeutic  value  of  harmonics,  Pythagoras <br/>discovered  that  the  seven  modes&#x2014;or  keys&#x2014;of  the  Greek  system  of  music  had  the  power  to  incite  or <br/>allay  the  various  emotions.  It  is  related  that  while  observing  the  stars  one  night  he  encountered  a <br/>young  man  befuddled  with  strong  drink  and  mad  with  jealousy  who  was  piling  faggots  about  his <br/>mistress'  door  with  the  intention  of  burning  the  house.  The  frenzy  of  the  youth  was  accentuated  by  a <br/>flutist  a  short  distance  away  who  was  playing  a  tune  in  the  stirring  Phrygian  mode.  Pythagoras <br/>induced  the  musician  to  change  his  air  to  the  slow,  and  rhythmic  Spondaic  mode,  whereupon  the <br/>intoxicated  youth  immediately  became  composed  and,  gathering  up  his  bundles  of  wood,  returned <br/>quietly  to  his  own  home. <br/><br/>There  is  also  an  account  of  how  Empedocles,  a  disciple  of  Pythagoras,  by  quickly  changing  the  mode <br/>of  a  musical  composition  he  was  playing,  saved  the  life  of  his  host,  Anchitus,  when  the  latter  was <br/>threatened  with  death  by  the  sword  of  one  whose  father  he  had  condemned  to  public  execution.  It  is <br/>also  known  that  Esculapius,  the  Greek  physician,  cured  sciatica  and  other  diseases  of  the  nerves  by <br/>blowing  a  loud  trumpet  in  the  presence  of  the  patient. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  cured  many  ailments  of  the  spirit,  soul,  and  body  by  having  certain  specially  prepared <br/>musical  compositions  played  in  the  presence  of  the  sufferer  or  by  personally  reciting  short  selections <br/>from  such  early  poets  as  Hesiod  and  Homer.  In  his  university  at  Crotona  it  was  customary  for  the <br/>Pythagoreans  to  open  and  to  close  each  day  with  songs&#x2014; those  in  the  morning  calculated  to  clear  the <br/>mind  from  sleep  and  inspire  it  to  the  activities  of  the  coming  day;  those  in  the  evening  of  a  mode <br/>soothing,  relaxing,  and  conducive  to  rest.  At  the  vernal  equinox,  Pjithagoras  caused  his  disciples  to <br/><br/><br/>gather  in  a  circle  around  one  of  their  number  who  led  them  in  song  and  played  their  accompaniment <br/>upon  a  lyre. <br/><br/>The  therapeutic  music  of  Pythagoras  is  described  by  lamblichus  thus:  &quot;And  there  are  certain  melodies <br/>devised  as  remedies  against  the  passions  of  the  soul,  and  also  against  despondency  and  lamentation, <br/>which  Pythagoras  invented  as  things  that  afford  the  greatest  assistance  in  these  maladies.  And  again, <br/>he  employed  other  melodies  against  rage  and  anger,  and  against  every  aberration  of  the  soul.  There  is <br/>also  another  kind  of  modulation  invented  as  a  remedy  against  desires.&quot;  (See  The  Life  of  Pythagoras.) <br/><br/>It  is  probable  that  the  Pythagoreans  recognized  a  connection  between  the  seven  Greek  modes  and  the <br/>planets.  As  an  example,  Pliny  declares  that  Saturn  moves  in  the  Dorian  mode  and  Jupiter  in  the <br/>Phrygian  mode.  It  is  also  apparent  that  the  temperaments  are  keyed  to  the  various  modes,  and  the <br/>passions  likewise.  Thus,  anger&#x2014;which  is  a  fiery  passion&#x2014; may  be  accentuated  by  a  fiery  mode  or  its <br/>power  neutralized  by  a  watery  mode. <br/><br/>The  far-reaching  effect  exercised  by  music  upon  the  culture  of  the  Greeks  is  thus  summed  up  by  Emil <br/>Nauman:  &quot;Plato  depreciated  the  notion  that  music  was  intended  solely  to  create  cheerful  and <br/>agreeable  emotions,  maintaining  rather  that  it  should  inculcate  a  love  of  all  that  is  noble,  and  hatred <br/>of  all  that  is  mean,  and  that  nothing  could  more  strongly  influence  man's  innermost  feelings  than <br/>melody  and  rhythm.  Firmly  convinced  of  this,  he  agreed  with  Damon  of  Athens,  the  musical <br/>instructor  of  Socrates,  that  the  introduction  of  a  new  and  presumably  enervating  scale  would <br/>endanger  the  future  of  a  whole  nation,  and  that  it  was  not  possible  to  alter  a  key  without  shaking  the <br/>very  foundations  of  the  State.  Plato  affirmed  that  music  which  ennobled  the  mind  was  of  a  far  higher <br/>kind  than  that  which  merely  appealed  to  the  senses,  and  he  strongly  insisted  that  it  was  the <br/>paramount  duty  of  the  Legislature  to  suppress  all  music  of  an  effeminate  and  lascivious  character, <br/>and  to  encourage  only  s  that  which  was  pure  and  dignified;  that  bold  and  stirring  melodies  were  for <br/>men,  gentle  and  soothing  ones  for  women.  From  this  it  is  evident  that  music  played  a  considerable <br/>part  in  the  education  of  the  Greek  youth.  The  greatest  care  was  also  to  be  taken  in  the  selection  of <br/>instrumental  music,  because  the  absence  of  words  rendered  its  signification  doubtful,  and  it  was <br/>difficult  to  foresee  whether  it  would  exercise  upon  the  people  a  benign  or  baneful  influence.  Popular <br/>taste,  being  always  tickled  by  sensuous  and  meretricious  effects,  was  to  be  treated  with  deserved <br/>contempt.  (See  The  History  of  Music.) <br/><br/>Even  today  martial  music  is  used  with  telling  effect  in  times  of  war,  and  religious  music,  while  no <br/>longer  developed  in  accordance  with  the  ancient  theory,  still  profoundly  influences  the  emotions  of <br/>the  laity. <br/><br/>THE  MUSIC  OF  THE  SPHERES <br/><br/>The  most  sublime  but  least  known  of  all  the  Pythagorean  speculations  was  that  of  sidereal  harmonics. <br/>It  was  said  that  of  all  men  only  Pythagoras  heard  the  music  of  the  spheres.  Apparently  the  Chaldeans <br/>were  the  first  people  to  conceive  of  the  heavenly  bodies  joining  in  a  cosmic  chant  as  they  moved  in <br/>stately  manner  across  the  sky.  Job  describes  a  time  &quot;when  the  stars  of  the  morning  sang  together,&quot; <br/>and  in  The  Merchant  of  Venice  the  author  of  the  Shakesperian  plays <br/><br/><br/>THE  MUNDANE  MONOCHORD  WITH  ITS  PROPORTIONS  AND  INTERVALS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  De  Musica  Mundana. <br/><br/>In  this  chart  is  set  forth  a  summary  of  Fludd's  theory  of  universal  music.  The  interval  between  the  element  of  earth  and <br/>the  highest  heaven  is  considered  as  a  double  octave,  thus  showing  the  two  extremes  of  existence  to  be  in  disdiapason <br/>harmony.  It  is  signifies  that  the  highest  heaven,  the  sun,  and  the  earth  have  the  same  time,  the  difference  being  in  pitch. <br/>The  sun  is  the  lower  octave  of  the  highest  heaven  and  the  earth  the  lower  octave  of  the  sun.  The  lower  octave  (T  to  G) <br/>comprises  that  part  of  the  universe  in  which  substance  predominate  over  energy.  Its  harmonies,  therefore,  are  more  gross <br/>than  those  of  the  higher  octave  (G  to  g)  wherein  energy  predominates  over  substance.  &quot;If  struck  in  the  more  spiritual <br/>part,&quot;  writes  Fludd,  &quot;the  monochord  will  give  eternal  life;  if  in  the  more  material  part,  transitory  life.&quot;  It  will  be  noted  that <br/>certain  elements,  planets,  and  celestial  spheres  sustain  a  harmonic  ratio  to  each  other,  Fludd  advanced  this  as  a  key  to  the <br/>sympathies  and  antipathies  existing  between  the  various  departments  of  Nature. <br/><br/>p.  83 <br/><br/>writes:  &quot;There's  not  the  smallest  orb  which  thou  behold'st  but  in  his  motion  like  an  angel  sings.&quot;  So <br/>little  remains,  however,  of  the  Pythagorean  system  of  celestial  music  that  it  is  only  possible  to <br/>approximate  his  actual  theory. <br/><br/>Pythagoras  conceived  the  universe  to  be  an  immense  monochord,  with  its  single  string  connected  at <br/>its  upper  end  to  absolute  spirit  and  at  its  lower  end  to  absolute  matter&#x2014;in  other  words,  a  cord <br/><br/><br/>stretched  between  heaven  and  earth.  Counting  inward  from  the  circumference  of  the  heavens, <br/>Pythagoras,  according  to  some  authorities,  divided  the  universe  into  nine  parts;  according  to  others, <br/>into  twelve  parts.  The  twelvefold  system  was  as  follows:  The  first  division  was  called  the  empyrean,  or <br/>the  sphere  of  the  fixed  stars,  and  was  the  dwelling  place  of  the  immortals.  The  second  to  twelfth <br/>divisions  were  (in  order)  the  spheres  of  Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  the  sun,  Venus,  Mercury,  and  the  moon, <br/>and  fire,  air,  water,  and  earth.  This  arrangement  of  the  seven  planets  (the  sun  and  moon  being <br/>regarded  as  planets  in  the  old  astronomy)  is  identical  with  the  candlestick  symbolism  of  the  Jews&#x2014;the <br/>sun  in  the  center  as  the  main  stem  with  three  planets  on  either  side  of  it. <br/><br/>The  names  given  by  the  Pythagoreans  to  the  various  notes  of  the  diatonic  scale  were,  according  to <br/>Macrobius,  derived  from  an  estimation  of  the  velocity  and  magnitude  of  the  planetary  bodies.  Each  of <br/>these  gigantic  spheres  as  it  rushed  endlessly  through  space  was  believed  to  sound  a  certain  tone <br/>caused  by  its  continuous  displacement  of  the  sethereal  diffusion.  As  these  tones  were  a  manifestation <br/>of  divine  order  and  motion,  it  must  necessarily  follow  that  they  partook  of  the  harmony  of  their  own <br/>source.  &quot;The  assertion  that  the  planets  in  their  revolutions  round  the  earth  uttered  certain  sounds <br/>differing  according  to  their  respective  'magnitude,  celerity  and  local  distance,'  was  commonly  made <br/>by  the  Greeks.  Thus  Saturn,  the  farthest  planet,  was  said  to  give  the  gravest  note,  while  the  Moon, <br/>which  is  the  nearest,  gave  the  sharpest.  'These  sounds  of  the  seven  planets,  and  the  sphere  of  the  fixed <br/>stars,  together  with  that  above  us  [Antichthon],  are  the  nine  Muses,  and  their  joint  symphony  is <br/>called  Mnemosyne.'&quot;  (See  The  Canon.)This  quotation  contains  an  obscure  reference  to  the  ninefold <br/>division  of  the  universe  previously  mentioned. <br/><br/>The  Greek  initiates  also  recognized  a  fundamental  relationship  between  the  individual  heavens  or <br/>spheres  of  the  seven  planets,  and  the  seven  sacred  vowels.  The  first  heaven  uttered  the  sound  of  the <br/>sacred  vowel  A  (Alpha);  the  second  heaven,  the  sacred  vowel  E  (Epsilon);  the  third,  H  (Eta);  the <br/>fourth,  I  (Iota);  the  fifth,  O  (Omicron);  the  sixth,  Y  (Upsilon);  and  the  seventh  heaven,  the  sacred <br/>vowel  n  (Omega).  When  these  seven  heavens  sing  together  they  produce  a  perfect  harmony  which <br/>ascends  as  an  everlasting  praise  to  the  throne  of  the  Creator.  (See  Irenseus'  Against  Heresies.) <br/>Although  not  so  stated,  it  is  probable  that  the  planetary  heavens  are  to  be  considered  as  ascending  in <br/>the  Pythagorean  order,  beginning  with  the  sphere  of  the  moon,  which  would  be  the  first  heaven. <br/><br/>Many  early  instruments  had  seven  Strings,  and  it  is  generally  conceded  that  Pythagoras  was  the  one <br/>who  added  the  eighth  string  to  the  lyre  of  Terpander.  The  seven  strings  were  always  related  both  to <br/>their  correspondences  in  the  human  body  and  to  the  planets.  The  names  of  God  were  also  conceived <br/>to  be  formed  from  combinations  of  the  seven  planetary  harmonies.  The  Egyptians  confined  their <br/>sacred  songs  to  the  seven  primary  sounds,  forbidding  any  others  to  be  uttered  in  their  temples.  One  of <br/>their  hymns  contained  the  following  invocation:  &quot;The  seven  sounding  tones  praise  Thee,  the  Great <br/>God,  the  ceaseless  working  Father  of  the  whole  universe.&quot;  In  another  the  Deity  describes  Himself  thus: <br/>&quot;I  am  the  great  indestructible  lyre  of  the  whole  world,  attuning  the  songs  of  the  heavens.  (See <br/>Nauman's  History  of  Music.) <br/><br/>The  Pythagoreans  believed  that  everything  which  existed  had  a  voice  and  that  all  creatures  were <br/>eternally  singing  the  praise  of  the  Creator.  Man  fails  to  hear  these  divine  melodies  because  his  soul  is <br/>enmeshed  in  the  illusion  of  material  existence.  When  he  liberates  himself  from  the  bondage  of  the <br/>lower  world  with  its  sense  limitations,  the  music  of  the  spheres  will  again  be  audible  as  it  was  in  the <br/>Golden  Age.  Harmony  recognizes  harmony,  and  when  the  human  soul  regains  its  true  estate  it  will <br/>not  only  hear  the  celestial  choir  but  also  join  with  it  in  an  everlasting  anthem  of  praise  to  that  Eternal <br/>Good  controlling  the  infinite  number  of  parts  and  conditions  of  Being. <br/><br/>The  Greek  Mysteries  included  in  their  doctrines  a  magnificent  concept  of  the  relationship  existing <br/>between  music  and  form.  The  elements  of  architecture,  for  example,  were  considered  as  comparable <br/>to  musical  modes  and  notes,  or  as  having  a  musical  counterpart.  Consequently  when  a  building  was <br/>erected  in  which  a  number  of  these  elements  were  combined,  the  structure  was  then  likened  to  a <br/><br/><br/>musical  chord,  which  was  harmonic  only  when  it  fully  satisfied  the  mathematical  requirements  of <br/>harmonic  intervals.  The  realization  of  this  analogy  between  sound  and  form  led  Goethe  to  declare  that <br/>&quot;architecture  is  crystallized  music.&quot; <br/><br/>In  constructing  their  temples  of  initiation,  the  early  priests  frequently  demonstrated  their  superior <br/>knowledge  of  the  principles  underlying  the  phenomena  known  as  vibration.  A  considerable  part  of  the <br/>Mystery  rituals  consisted  of  invocations  and  intonements,  for  which  purpose  special  sound  chambers <br/>were  constructed.  A  word  whispered  in  one  of  these  apartments  was  so  intensified  that  the <br/>reverberations  made  the  entire  building  sway  and  be  filled  with  a  deafening  roar.  The  very  wood  and <br/>stone  used  in  the  erection  of  these  sacred  buildings  eventually  became  so  thoroughly  permeated  with <br/>the  sound  vibrations  of  the  religious  ceremonies  that  when  struck  they  would  reproduce  the  same <br/>tones  thus  repeatedly  impressed  into  their  substances  by  the  rituals. <br/><br/>Every  element  in  Nature  has  its  individual  keynote.  If  these  elements  are  combined  in  a  composite <br/>structure  the  result  is  a  chord  that,  if  sounded,  will  disintegrate  the  compound  into  its  integral  parts. <br/>Likewise  each  individual  has  a  keynote  that,  if  sounded,  will  destroy  him.  The  allegory  of  the  walls  of <br/>Jericho  falling  when  the  trumpets  of  Israel  were  sounded  is  undoubtedly  intended  to  set  forth  the <br/>arcane  significance  of  individual  keynote  or  vibration. <br/><br/>THE  PHILOSOPHY  OF  COLOR <br/><br/>&quot;Light,&quot;  writes  Edwin  D.  Babbitt,  &quot;reveals  the  glories  of  the  external  world  and  yet  is  the  most  glorious <br/>of  them  all.  It  gives  beauty,  reveals  beauty  and  is  itself  most  beautiful.  It  is  the  analyzer,  the  truth- <br/>teller  and  the  exposer  of  shams,  for  it  shows  things  as  they  are.  Its  infinite  streams  measure  off  the <br/>universe  and  flow  into  our  telescopes  from  stars  which  are  quintillions  of  miles  distant.  On  the  other <br/>hand  it  descends  to  objects  inconceivably  small,  and  reveals  through  the  microscope  objects  fifty <br/>millions  of  times  less  than  can  be  seen  by  the  naked  eye.  Like  all  other  fine  forces,  its  movement  is <br/>wonderfully  soft,  yet  penetrating  and  powerful.  Without  its  vivifying  influence,  vegetable,  animal,  and <br/>human  life  must  immediately  perish  from  the  earth,  and  general  ruin  take  place.  We  shall  do  well, <br/>then,  to  consider  this  potential  and  beautiful  principle  of  light  and  its  component  colors,  for  the  more <br/>deeply  we  penetrate  into  its  inner  laws,  the  more  will  it  present  itself  as  a  marvelous  storehouse  of <br/>power  to  vitalize,  heal,  refine,  and  delight  mankind.&quot;  (See  The  Principles  of  Light  and  Color.) <br/><br/>Since  light  is  the  basic  physical  manifestation  of  life,  bathing  all  creation  in  its  radiance,  it  is  highly <br/>important  to  realize,  in  part  at  least,  the  subtle  nature  of  this  divine  substance.  That  which  is  called <br/>light  is  actually  a  rate  of  vibration  causing  certain  reactions  upon  the  optic  nerve.  Few  realize  how <br/>they  are  walled  in  by  the  limitations <br/><br/><br/>THE  THEORY  OF  ELEMENTAL  MUSIC. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  De  Musica  Mundana. <br/><br/>In  this  diagram  two  interpenetrating  pyramids  are  again  employed,  one  of  which  represents  fire  and  the  other  earth.  It  is <br/>demonstrated  according  to  the  law  of  elemental  harmony  that  fire  does  not  enter  into  the  composition  of  earth  nor  earth <br/>into  the  composition  of  fire.  The  figures  on  the  chart  disclose  the  harmonic  relationships  existing  between  the  four <br/>primary  elements  according  to  both  Fludd  and  the  Pythagoreans.  Earth  consists  of  four  parts  of  its  own  nature;  water  of <br/>three  parts  of  earth  and  one  part  of  fire.  The  sphere  of  equality  is  a  hypothetical  point  where  there  is  an  equilibrium  of  two <br/>parts  of  earth  and  two  parts  of  fire.  Air  is  composed  of  three  parts  of  fire  and  one  part  of  earth;  fire,  of  four  parts  of  its  own <br/>nature.  Thus  earth  and  water  bear  to  each  other  the  ratio  of  4  to  3,  or  the  diatessaron  harmony,  and  water  and  the  sphere <br/>of  equality  the  ratio  of  3  to  2,  or  the  diapente  harmony.  Fire  and  air  also  bear  to  each  other  the  ratio  of  4  to  3,  or  the <br/>diatessaron  harmony,  and  air  and  the  sphere  of  equality  the  ratio  of  3  to  2,  or  the  diapente  harmony.  As  the  sum  of  a <br/>diatessaron  and  a  diapente  equals  a  diapason,  or  octave,  it  is  evident  that  both  the  sphere  of  fire  and  the  sphere  of  earth <br/>are  in  diapason  harmony  with  the  sphere  of  equality,  and  also  that  fire  and  earth  are  in  disdiapason  harmony  with  each <br/>other. <br/><br/>p.  84 <br/><br/>of  the  sense  perceptions.  Not  only  is  there  a  great  deal  more  to  light  than  anyone  has  ever  seen  but <br/>there  are  also  unknown  forms  of  light  which  no  optical  equipment  will  ever  register.  There  are <br/>unnumbered  colors  which  cannot  be  seen,  as  well  as  sounds  which  cannot  be  heard,  odors  which <br/>cannot  be  smelt,  flavors  which  cannot  be  tasted,  and  substances  which  cannot  be  felt.  Man  is  thus <br/><br/><br/>surrounded  by  a  supersensible  universe  of  which  he  knows  nothing  because  the  centers  of  sense <br/>perception  within  himself  have  not  been  developed  sufficiently  to  respond  to  the  subtler  rates  of <br/>vibration  of  which  that  universe  is  composed. <br/><br/>Among  both  civilized  and  savage  peoples  color  has  been  accepted  as  a  natural  language  in  which  to <br/>couch  their  religious  and  philosophical  doctrines.  The  ancient  city  of  Ecbatana  as  described  by <br/>Herodotus,  its  seven  walls  colored  according  to  the  seven  planets,  revealed  the  knowledge  of  this <br/>subject  possessed  by  the  Persian  Magi.  The  famous  zikkurat  or  astronomical  tower  of  the  god  Nebo  at <br/>Borsippa  ascended  in  seven  great  steps  or  stages,  each  step  being  painted  in  the  key  color  of  one  of <br/>the  planetary  bodies.  (See  Lenormant's  Chaldean  Magic.)  It  is  thus  evident  that  the  Babylonians  were <br/>familiar  with  the  concept  of  the  spectrum  in  its  relation  to  the  seven  Creative  Gods  or  Powers.  In <br/>India,  one  of  the  Mogul  emperors  caused  a  fountain  to  be  made  with  seven  levels.  The  water  pouring <br/>down  the  sides  through  specially  arranged  channels  changed  color  as  it  descended,  passing <br/>sequentially  through  all  shades  of  the  spectrum.  In  Tibet,  color  is  employed  by  the  native  artists  to <br/>express  various  moods.  L.  Austine  Waddell,  writing  of  Northern  Buddhist  art,  notes  that  in  Tibetan <br/>mythology  &quot;White  and  yellow  complexions  usually  typify  mild  moods,  while  the  red,  blue,  and  black <br/>belong  to  fierce  forms,  though  sometimes  light  blue,  as  indicating  the  sky,  means  merely  celestial. <br/>Generally  the  gods  are  pictured  white,  goblins  red,  and  devils  black,  like  their  European  relative.&quot;  (See <br/>The  Buddhism  of  Tibet) <br/><br/>In  Meno,  Plato,  speaking  through  Socrates,  describes  color  as  &quot;an  effluence  of  form,  commensurate <br/>with  sight,  and  sensible.&quot;  In  Thesetetus  he  discourses  more  at  length  on  the  subject  thus:  &quot;Let  us  carry <br/>out  the  principle  which  has  just  been  affirmed,  that  nothing  is  self-existent,  and  then  we  shall  see  that <br/>every  color,  white,  black,  and  every  other  color,  arises  out  of  the  eye  meeting  the  appropriate  motion, <br/>and  that  what  we  term  the  substance  of  each  color  is  neither  the  active  nor  the  passive  element,  but <br/>something  which  passes  between  them,  and  is  peculiar  to  each  percipient;  are  you  certain  that  the <br/>several  colors  appear  to  every  animal&#x2014;say  a  dog~as  they  appear  to  you?&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  Pythagorean  fefracfys&#x2014;the  supreme  symbol  of  universal  forces  and  processes&#x2014;are  set  forth  the <br/>theories  of  the  Greeks  concerning  color  and  music.  The  first  three  dots  represent  the  threefold  White <br/>Light,  which  is  the  Godhead  containing  potentially  all  sound  and  color.  The  remaining  seven  dots  are <br/>the  colors  of  the  spectrum  and  the  notes  of  the  musical  scale.  The  colors  and  tones  are  the  active <br/>creative  powers  which,  emanating  from  the  First  Cause,  establish  the  universe.  The  seven  are  divided <br/>into  two  groups,  one  containing  three  powers  and  the  other  four  a  relationship  also  shown  in  the <br/>tetractys.  The  higher  group&#x2014; that  of  three&#x2014; becomes  the  spiritual  nature  of  the  created  universe;  the <br/>lower  group&#x2014; that  of  four&#x2014; manifests  as  the  irrational  sphere,  or  inferior  world. <br/><br/>In  the  Mysteries  the  seven  Logi,  or  Creative  Lords,  are  shown  as  streams  of  force  issuing  from  the <br/>mouth  of  the  Eternal  One.  This  signifies  the  spectrum  being  extracted  from  the  white  light  of  the <br/>Supreme  Deity.  The  seven  Creators,  or  Fabricators,  of  the  inferior  spheres  were  called  by  the  Jews  the <br/>Elohim.  By  the  Egyptians  they  were  referred  to  as  the  Builders  (sometimes  as  the  Governors)  and  are <br/>depicted  with  great  knives  in  their  hands  with  which  they  carved  the  universe  from  its  primordial <br/>substance.  Worship  of  the  planets  is  based  upon  their  acceptation  as  the  cosmic  embodiments  of  the <br/>seven  creative  attributes  of  God.  The  Lords  of  the  planets  were  described  as  dwelling  within  the  body <br/>of  the  sun,  for  the  true  nature  of  the  sun,  being  analogous  to  the  white  light,  contains  the  seeds  of  all <br/>the  tone  and  color  potencies  which  it  manifests. <br/><br/>There  are  numerous  arbitrary  arrangements  setting  forth  the  mutual  relationships  of  the  planets,  the <br/>colors,  and  the  musical  notes.  The  most  satisfactory  system  is  that  based  upon  the  law  of  the  octave. <br/>The  sense  of  hearing  has  a  much  wider  scope  than  that  of  sight,  for  whereas  the  ear  can  register  from <br/>nine  to  eleven  octaves  of  sound  the  eye  is  restricted  to  the  cognition  of  but  seven  fundamental  color <br/>tones,  or  one  tone  short  of  the  octave.  Red,  when  posited  as  the  lowest  color  tone  in  the  scale  of <br/>chromatics,  thus  corresponds  to  do,  the  first  note  of  the  musical  scale.  Continuing  the  analogy,  orange <br/><br/><br/>corresponds  to  re,  yellow  to  mi,  green  to  fa,  blue  to  sol,  indigo  to  la,  and  violet  to  si  {ti).  The  eighth <br/>color  tone  necessary  to  complete  the  scale  should  be  the  higher  octave  of  red,  the  first  color  tone.  The <br/>accuracy  of  the  above  arrangement  is  attested  by  two  striking  facts:  (i)  the  three  fundamental  notes  of <br/>the  musical  scale&#x2014;the  first,  the  third,  and  the  fifth&#x2014;correspond  with  the  three  primary  colors&#x2014; red, <br/>yellow,  and  blue;  (2)  the  seventh,  and  least  perfect,  note  of  the  musical  scale  corresponds  with  purple, <br/>the  least  perfect  tone  of  the  color  scale. <br/><br/>In  The  Principles  of  Light  and  Color,  Edwin  D.  Babbitt  confirms  the  correspondence  of  the  color  and <br/>musical  scales:  &quot;As  C  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  musical  scale  and  made  with  the  coarsest  waves  of  air,  so <br/>is  red  at  the  bottom  of  the  chromatic  scale  and  made  with  the  coarsest  waves  of  luminous  ether.  As <br/>the  musical  note  B  [the  seventh  note  of  the  scale]  requires  45  vibrations  of  air  every  time  the  note  C  at <br/>the  lower  end  of  the  scale  requires  24,  or  but  little  over  half  as  many,  so  does  extreme  violet  require <br/>about  300  trillions  of  vibrations  of  ether  in  a  second,  while  extreme  red  requires  only  about  450 <br/>trillions,  which  also  are  but  little  more  than  half  as  many.  When  one  musical  octave  is  finished <br/>another  one  commences  and  progresses  with  just  twice  as  many  vibrations  as  were  used  in  the  first <br/>octave,  and  so  the  same  notes  are  repeated  on  a  finer  scale.  In  the  same  way  when  the  scale  of  colors <br/>visible  to  the  ordinary  eye  is  completed  in  the  violet,  another  octave  of  finer  invisible  colors,  with  just <br/>twice  as  many  vibrations,  will  commence  and  progress  on  precisely  the  same  law.&quot; <br/><br/>When  the  colors  are  related  to  the  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac,  they  are  arranged  as  the  spokes  of  a <br/>wheel.  To  Aries  is  assigned  pure  red;  to  Taurus,  red-orange;  to  Gemini,  pure  orange;  to  Cancer, <br/>orange-yellow;  to  Leo,  pure  yellow;  to  Virgo,  yellow-green;  to  Libra,  pure  green;  to  Scorpio,  green- <br/>blue;  to  Sagittarius,  pure  blue;  to  Capricorn,  blue-violet;  to  Aquarius,  pure  violet;  and  to  Pisces, <br/>violet-red. <br/><br/>In  expounding  the  Eastern  system  of  esoteric  philosophy,  H.  P,  Blavatsky  relates  the  colors  to  the <br/>septenary  constitution  of  man  and  the  seven  states  of  matter  as  follows: <br/><br/><br/>This  arrangement  of  the  colors  of  the  spectrum  and  the  musical  notes  of  the  octave  necessitates  a <br/>different  grouping  of  the  planets  in  order  to  preserve  their  proper  tone  and  color  analogies.  Thus  do <br/>becomes  Mars;  re,  the  sun;  mi.  Mercury; /a,  Saturn;  sol,  Jupiter;  la,  Venus;  si  (ti)  the  moon.  (See  The <br/>E.  S.

The  first  division  of  each <br/>element  is  the  grossest,  partaking  somewhat  of  the  substance  directly  inferior  to  itself  (except  in  the  case  of  the  earth, <br/>which  has  no  state  inferior  to  itself).  The  second  division  consists  of  the  element  in  its  relatively  pure  state,  while  the  third <br/>division  is  that  condition  wherein  the  element  partakes  somewhat  of  the  substance  immediately  superior  to  itself.  For <br/>example  the  lowest  division  of  the  element  of  water  is  sedimentary,  as  it  contains  earth  substance  in  solution;  the  second <br/>division  represents  water  in  its  most  common  state~salty~as  in  the  case  of  the  ocean;  and  the  third  division  is  water  in  its <br/>purest  state&#x2014;free  from  salt.  The  harmonic  interval  assigned  to  the  lowest  division  of  each  element  is  one  tone,  to  the <br/>central  division  also  a  tone,  but  to  the  higher  division  a  half-tone  because  it  partakes  of  the  division  immediately  above  it. <br/>Fludd  emphasizes  the  fact  that  as  the  elements  ascend  in  series  of  two  and  a  half  tones,  the  diatessaron  is  the  dominating <br/>harmonic  interval  of  the  elements. <br/><br/><br/>p.  85 <br/><br/>Fishes,  Insects,  Animals,  Reptiles  and <br/><br/>Birds <br/><br/>Part  One <br/><br/>THE  creatures  inhabiting  the  water,  air,  and  earth  were  held  in  veneration  by  all  races  of  antiquity. <br/>Realizing  that  visible  bodies  are  only  symbols  of  invisible  forces,  the  ancients  worshiped  the  Divine <br/>Power  through  the  lower  kingdoms  of  Nature,  because  those  less  evolved  and  more  simply <br/>constituted  creatures  responded  most  readily  to  the  creative  impulses  of  the  gods.  The  sages  of  old <br/>studied  living  things  to  a  point  of  realization  that  God  is  most  perfectly  understood  through  a <br/>knowledge  of  His  supreme  handiwork&#x2014;animate  and  inanimate  Nature. <br/><br/>Every  existing  creature  manifests  some  aspect  of  the  intelligence  or  power  of  the  Eternal  One,  who <br/>can  never  be  known  save  through  a  study  and  appreciation  of  His  numbered  but  inconceivable  parts. <br/>When  a  creature  is  chosen,  therefore,  to  symbolize  to  the  concrete  human  mind  some  concealed <br/>abstract  principle  it  is  because  its  characteristics  demonstrate  this  invisible  principle  in  visible  action. <br/>Fishes,  insects,  animals,  reptiles,  and  birds  appear  in  the  religious  symbolism  of  nearly  all  nations, <br/>because  the  forms  and  habits  of  these  creatures  and  the  media  in  which  they  exist  closely  relate  them <br/>to  the  various  generative  and  germinative  powers  of  Nature,  which  were  considered  as  prima-facie <br/>evidence  of  divine  omnipresence. <br/><br/>The  early  philosophers  and  scientists,  realizing  that  all  life  has  its  origin  in  water,  chose  the  fish  as  the <br/>symbol  of  the  life  germ.  The  fact  that  fishes  are  most  prolific  makes  the  simile  still  more  apt.  While <br/>the  early  priests  may  not  have  possessed  the  instruments  necessary  to  analyze  the  spermatozoon,  they <br/>concluded  by  deduction  that  it  resembled  a  fish. <br/><br/>Fishes  were  sacred  to  the  Greeks  and  Romans,  being  connected  with  the  worship  of  Aphrodite <br/>(Venus).  An  interesting  survival  of  pagan  ritualism  is  found  in  the  custom  of  eating  fish  on  Friday. <br/>Freya,  in  whose  honor  the  day  was  named,  was  the  Scandinavian  Venus,  and  this  day  was  sacred <br/>among  many  nations  to  the  goddess  of  beauty  and  fecundity.  This  analogy  further  links  the  fish  with <br/>the  procreative  mystery.  Friday  is  also  sacred  to  the  followers  of  the  Prophet  Mohammed. <br/><br/>The  word  nun  means  both  fish  and  growth,  and  as  Inman  says:  &quot;The  Jews  were  led  to  victory  by  the <br/>Son  of  the  Fish  whose  other  names  were  Joshua  and  Jesus  (the  Savior).  Nun  is  still  the  name  of  a <br/>female  devotee&quot;  of  the  Christian  faith.  Among  early  Christians  three  fishes  were  used  to  symbolize  the <br/>Trinity,  and  the  fish  is  also  one  of  the  eight  sacred  symbols  of  the  great  Buddha.  It  is  also  significant <br/>that  the  dolphin  should  be  sacred  to  both  Apollo  (the  Solar  Savior)  and  Neptune.  It  was  believed  that <br/>this  fish  carried  shipwrecked  sailors  to  heaven  on  its  back.  The  dolphin  was  accepted  by  the  early <br/>Christians  as  an  emblem  of  Christ,  because  the  pagans  had  viewed  this  beautiful  creature  as  a  friend <br/>and  benefactor  of  man.  The  heir  to  the  throne  of  France,  the  Dauphin,  may  have  secured  his  title  from <br/>this  ancient  pagan  symbol  of  the  divine  preservative  power.  The  first  advocates  of  Christianity  likened <br/>converts  to  fishes,  who  at  the  time  of  baptism  &quot;returned  again  into  the  sea  of  Christ.&quot; <br/><br/>Primitive  peoples  believed  the  sea  and  land  were  inhabited  by  strange  creatures,  and  early  books  on <br/>zoology  contain  curious  illustrations  of  composite  beasts,  reptiles,  and  fishes,  which  did  not  exist  at <br/>the  time  the  mediaeval  authors  compiled  these  voluminous  books.  In  the  ancient  initiatory  rituals  of <br/>the  Persian,  Greek,  and  Egyptian  Mysteries  the  priests  disguised  themselves  as  composite  creatures, <br/>thereby  symbolizing  different  aspects  of  human  consciousness.  They  used  birds  and  reptiles  as <br/>emblems  of  their  various  deities,  often  creating  forms  of  grotesque  appearance  and  assigning  to  them <br/><br/><br/>imaginary  traits,  habits,  and  places  of  domicile,  all  of  which  were  symbolic  of  certain  spiritual  and <br/>transcendental  truths  thus  concealed  from  the  profane.  The  phoenix  made  its  nest  of  incense  and <br/>flames.  The  unicorn  had  the  body  of  a  horse,  the  feet  of  an  elephant,  and  the  tail  of  a  wild  boar.  The <br/>upper  half  of  the  centaur's  body  was  human  and  the  lower  half  equine.  The  pelican  of  the  Hermetists <br/>fed  its  young  from  its  own  breast,  and  to  this  bird  were  assigned  other  mysterious  attributes  which <br/>could  have  been  true  only  allegorically. <br/><br/>Though  regarded  by  many  writers  of  the  Middle  Ages  as  actual  living  creatures,  none  of  these&#x2014;the <br/>pelican  excepted&#x2014;ever  existed  outside  the  symbolism  of  the  Mysteries.  Possibly  they  originated  in <br/>rumors  of  animals  then  little  known.  In  the  temple,  however,  they  became  a  reality,  for  there  they <br/>signified  the  manifold  characteristics  of  man's  nature.  The  mantichora  had  certain  points  in  common <br/>with  the  hyena;  the  unicorn  may  have  been  the  single-horned  rhinoceros.  To  the  student  of  the  secret <br/>wisdom  these  composite  animals,  and  birds  simply  represent  various  forces  working  in  the  invisible <br/>worlds.  This  is  a  point  which  nearly  all  writers  on  the  subject  of  medieval  monsters  seem  to  have <br/>overlooked.  (See  Vlyssis  Aldrovandi's  Monstrorum  Historia,  1642,  and  Physica  Curiosa,  by  P. <br/>Gaspare  Schotto,  1697.) <br/><br/>There  are  also  legends  to  the  effect  that  long  before  the  appearance  of  human  beings  there  existed  a <br/>race  or  species  of  composite  creatures  which  was  destroyed  by  the  gods.  The  temples  of  antiquity <br/>preserved  their  own  historical  records  and  possessed  information  concerning  the  prehistoric  world <br/>that  has  never  been  revealed  to  the  uninitiated.  According  to  these  records,  the  human  race  evolved <br/>from  a  species  of  creature  that  partook  somewhat  of  the  nature  of  an  amphibian,  for  at  that  time <br/>primitive  man  had  the  gills  of  a  fish  and  was  partly  covered  with  scales.  To  a  limited  degree,  the <br/>human  embryo  demonstrates  the  possibility  of  such  a  condition.  As  a  result  of  the  theory  of  man's <br/>origin  in  water,  the  fish  was  looked  upon  as  the  progenitor  of  the  human  family.  This  gave  rise  to  the <br/>ichthyolatry  of  the  Chaldeans,  Phoenicians,  and  Brahmins.  The  American  Indians  believe  that  the <br/>waters  of  lakes,  rivers,  and  oceans  are  inhabited  by  a  mysterious  people,  the  &quot;Water  Indians.&quot; <br/><br/>The  fish  has  been  used  as  an  emblem  of  damnation;  but  among  the  Chinese  it  typified  contentment <br/>and  good  fortune,  and  fishes  appear  on  many  of  their  coins.  When  Typhon,  or  Set,  the  Egyptian  evil <br/>genius,  had  divided  the  body  of  the  god  Osiris  into  fourteen  parts,  he  cast  one  part  into  the  river  Nile, <br/>where,  according  to  Plutarch,  it  was  devoured  by  three  fishes&#x2014; the  lepidotus  (probably  the <br/>lepidosiren),  the  phagrus,  and  the  oxyrynchus  (a  form  of  pike).  For  this  reason  the  Egyptians  would <br/>not  eat  the  flesh  of  these  fishes,  believing  that  to  do  so  would  be  to  devour  the  body  of  their  god. <br/>When  used  as  a  symbol  of  evil,  the  fish  represented  the  earth  (man's  lower  nature)  and  the  tomb  (the <br/>sepulcher  of  the  Mysteries).  Thus  was  Jonah  three  days  in  the  belly  of  the  &quot;great  fish,&quot;  as  Christ  was <br/>three  days  in  the  tomb. <br/><br/>Several  early  church  fathers  believed  that  the  &quot;whale&quot;  which  swallowed  Jonah  was  the  symbol  of  God <br/>the  Father,  who,  when  the  hapless  prophet  was  thrown  overboard,  accepted  Jonah  into  His  own <br/>nature  until  a  place  of  safety  was  reached.  The  story  of  Jonah  is  really  a  legend  of  initiation  into  the <br/>Mysteries,  and  the  &quot;great  fish&quot;  represents  the  darkness  of  ignorance  which  engulfs  man  when  he  is <br/>thrown  over  the  side  of  the  ship  (is  born)  into  the  sea  (life).  The  custom  of  building  ships  in  the  form <br/>of  fishes  or  birds,  common  in  ancient  times,  could  give  rise  to  the  story,  and  mayhap  Jonah  was <br/>merely  picked  up  by <br/><br/><br/>THE  FIRST  INCARNATION,  OR  MATSYA  AVATAR,  OF  VISHNU. <br/><br/><br/>From  Picart's  Religious  Ceremonials. <br/><br/>The  fish  has  often  been  associated  with  the  World  Saviors.  Vishnu,  the  Hindu  Redeemer,  who  takes  upon  himself  ten <br/>forms  for  the  redemption  of  the  universe,  was  expelled  from  the  mouth  of  a  fish  in  his  first  incarnation.  Isis,  while  nursing <br/>the  infant  Horus,  is  often  shown  with  a  fish  on  her  headdress.  Oannes,  the  Chaldean  Savior  (borrowed  from  the <br/>Brahmins),  is  depicted  with  the  head  and  body  of  a  fish,  from  which  his  human  form  protrudes  at  various  points.  Jesus <br/>was  often  symbolized  by  a  fish.  He  told  His  disciples  that  they  should  became  &quot;fishers  of  men.&quot;  The  sign  of  the  fish  was <br/>also  the  first  monogram  of  the  Christians.  The  mysterious  Greek  name  of  Jesus,  IX0Y2,  means  &quot;a  fish.&quot;  The  fish  was <br/>accepted  as  a  symbol  of  the  Christ  by  a  number  of  early  canonized  church  fathers.  St.  Augustine  likened  the  Christ  to  a  fish <br/>that  had  been  broiled,  and  it  was  also  pointed  out  that  the  flesh  of  that  Fish  was  the  food  of  righteous  and  holy  men. <br/><br/>p.  86 <br/><br/>another  vessel  and  carried  into  port,  the  pattern  of  the  ship  causing  it  to  be  called  a  &quot;great  fish.&quot; <br/>CVeritatis  simplex  oratio  est!&quot;)  More  probably  the  &quot;whale&quot;  of  Jonah  is  based  upon  the  pagan <br/>mythological  creature,  hippocampus,  part  horse  and  part  dolphin,  for  the  early  Christian  statues  and <br/>carvings  show  the  composite  creature  and  not  a  true  whale. <br/><br/>It  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  the  mysterious  sea  serpents,  which,  according  to  the  Mayan  and <br/>Toltec  legends,  brought  the  gods  to  Mexico  were  Viking  or  Chaldean  ships,  built  in  the  shape  of <br/>composite  sea  monsters  or  dragons.  H.  P.  Blavatsky  advances  the  theory  that  the  word  cetus,  the  great <br/>whale,  is  derived  from  keto,  a  name  for  the  fish  god,  Dagon,  and  that  Jonah  was  actually  confined  in  a <br/>cell  hollowed  out  in  the  body  of  a  gigantic  statue  of  Dagon  after  he  had  been  captured  by  Phoenician <br/>sailors  and  carried  to  one  of  their  cities.  There  is  no  doubt  a  great  mystery  in  the  gigantic  form  of <br/>cetus,  which  is  still  preserved  as  a  constellation. <br/><br/><br/>According  to  many  scattered  fragments  extant,  man's  lower  nature  was  symbolized  by  a  tremendous, <br/>awkward  creature  resembling  a  great  sea  serpent,  or  dragon,  called  leviathan.  All  symbols  having <br/>serpentine  form  or  motion  signify  the  solar  energy  in  one  of  its  many  forms.  This  great  creature  of  the <br/>sea  therefore  represents  the  solar  life  force  imprisoned  in  water  and  also  the  divine  energy  coursing <br/>through  the  body  of  man,  where,  until  transmuted,  it  manifests  itself  as  a  writhing,  twisting  monster&#x2014; <br/>-man's  greeds,  passions,  and  lusts.  Among  the  symbols  of  Christ  as  the  Savior  of  men  are  a  number <br/>relating  to  the  mystery  of  His  divine  nature  concealed  within  the  personality  of  the  lowly  Jesus. <br/><br/>The  Gnostics  divided  the  nature  of  the  Christian  Redeemer  into  two  parts&#x2014;the  one  Jesus,  a  mortal <br/>man;  the  other,  Christos,  a  personification  of  Nous,  the  principle  of  Cosmic  Mind.  Nous,  the  greater, <br/>was  for  the  period  of  three  years  (from  baptism  to  crucifixion)  using  the  fleshly  garment  of  the  mortal <br/>man  (Jesus).  In  order  to  illustrate  this  point  and  still  conceal  it  from  the  ignorant,  many  strange,  and <br/>often  repulsive,  creatures  were  used  whose  rough  exteriors  concealed  magnificent  organisms.  Kenealy, <br/>in  his  notes  on  the  Book  of  Enoch,  observes:  &quot;Why  the  caterpillar  was  a  symbol  of  the  Messiah  is <br/>evident;  because,  under  a  lowly,  creeping,  and  wholly  terrestrial  aspect,  he  conceals  the  beautiful <br/>butterfly-form,  with  its  radiant  wings,  emulating  in  its  varied  colors  the  Rainbow,  the  Serpent,  the <br/>Salmon,  the  Scarab,  the  Peacock,  and  the  dying  Dolphin  *  *  *. <br/><br/>INSECTS <br/><br/>In  1609  Henry  Khunrath'sAmp/iif/ieaf rum  Sapientise ^ternae  was  published.  Eliphas  Levi  declared <br/>that  within  its  pages  are  concealed  all  the  great  secrets  of  magical  philosophy.  A  remarkable  plate  in <br/>this  work  shows  the  Hermetic  sciences  being  attacked  by  the  bigoted  and  ignorant  pedagogues  of  the <br/>seventeenth  century.  In  order  to  express  his  complete  contempt  for  his  slanderers,  Khunrath  made <br/>out  of  each  a  composite  beast,  adding  donkey  ears  to  one  and  a  false  tail  to  another.  He  reserved  the <br/>upper  part  of  the  picture  for  certain  petty  backbiters  whom  he  gave  appropriate  forms.  The  air  was <br/>filled  with  strange  creatures&#x2014;great  dragon  flies,  winged  frogs,  birds  with  human  heads,  and  other <br/>weird  forms  which  defy  description&#x2014; heaping  venom,  gossip,  spite,  slander,  and  other  forms  of <br/>persecution  upon  the  secret  arcanum  of  the  wise.  The  drawing  indicated  that  their  attacks  were <br/>ineffectual.  Poisonous  insects  were  often  used  to  symbolize  the  deadly  power  of  the  human  tongue. <br/><br/>Insects  of  all  kinds  were  also  considered  emblematic  of  the  Nature  spirits  and  dsemons,  for  both  were <br/>believed  to  inhabit  the  atmosphere.  Mediaeval  drawings  showing  magicians  in  the  act  of  invoking <br/>spirits,  often  portray  the  mysterious  powers  of  the  other  world,  which  the  conjurer  has  exorcised,  as <br/>appearing  to  him  in  composite  part-insect  forms.  The  early  philosophers  apparently  held  the  opinion <br/>that  the  disease  which  swept  through  communities  in  the  form  of  plagues  were  actually  living <br/>creatures,  but  instead  of  considering  a  number  of  tiny  germs  they  viewed  the  entire  plague  as  one <br/>individuality  and  gave  it  a  hideous  shape  to  symbolize  its  destructiveness.  The  fact  that  plagues  came <br/>in  the  air  caused  an  insect  or  a  bird  to  be  used  as  their  symbol. <br/><br/>Beautiful  symmetrical  forms  were  assigned  to  all  natural  benevolent  conditions  or  powers,  but  to <br/>unnatural  or  malevolent  powers  were  assigned  contorted  and  abnormal  figures.  The  Evil  One  was <br/>either  hideously  deformed  or  else  of  the  nature  of  certain  despised  animals.  A  popular  superstition <br/>during  the  Middle  Ages  held  that  the  Devil  had  the  feet  of  a  rooster,  while  the  Egyptians  assigned  to <br/>Typhon  (Devil)  the  body  of  a  hog. <br/><br/>The  habits  of  the  insects  were  carefully  studied.  Therefore  the  ant  was  looked  upon  as  emblematic  of <br/>industry  and  foresight,  as  it  stored  up  supplies  for  the  winter  and  also  had  strength  to  move  objects <br/>many  times  its  own  weight.  The  locusts  which  swept  down  in  clouds,  and  in  some  parts  of  Africa  and <br/>Asia  obscured  the  sun  and  destroyed  every  green  thing,  were  considered  fit  emblems  of  passion, <br/>disease,  hate,  and  strife;  for  these  emotions  destroy  all  that  is  good  in  the  soul  of  man  and  leave  a <br/>barren  desert  behind  them.  In  the  folklore  of  various  nations,  certain  insects  are  given  special <br/>significance,  but  the  ones  which  have  received  world-wide  veneration  and  consideration  ate  the <br/><br/><br/>scarab,  the  king  of  the  insect  kingdom;  the  scorpion,  the  great  betrayer;  the  butterfly,  the  emblem  of <br/>metamorphosis;  and  the  bee,  the  symbol  of  industry. <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  scarab  is  one  of  the  most  remarkable  symbolic  figures  ever  conceived  by  the  mind  of <br/>man.  It  was  evolved  by  the  erudition  of  the  priestcraft  from  a  simple  insect  which,  because  of  its <br/>peculiar  habits  and  appearance,  properly  symbolized  the  strength  of  the  body,  the  resurrection  of  the <br/>soul,  and  the  Eternal  and  Incomprehensible  Creator  in  His  aspect  as  Lord  of  the  Sun.  E.  A.  Wallis <br/>Budge  says,  in  effect,  of  the  worship  of  the  scarab  by  the  Egyptians: <br/><br/>&quot;Yet  another  view  held  in  primitive  times  was  that  the  sky  was  a  vast  meadow  over  which  a  huge <br/>beetle  crawled,  pushing  the  disk  of  the  sun  before  him.  This  beetle  was  the  Sky-god,  and,  arguing <br/>from  the  example  of  the  beetle  (Scarabaeus  sacer),  which  was  observed  to  roll  along  with  its  hind  legs <br/>a  ball  that  was  believed  to  contain  its  eggs,  the  early  Egyptians  thought  that  the  ball  of  the  Sky-god <br/>contained  his  egg  and  that  the  sun  was  his  offspring.  Thanks,  however,  to  the  investigations  of  the <br/>eminent  entomologist,  Monsieur  J.  H.  Fabre,  we  now  know  that  the  ball  which  the  Scarahseus  sacer <br/>rolls  along  contains  not  its  eggs,  but  dung  that  is  to  serve  as  food  for  its  egg,  which  it  lays  in  a  carefully <br/>prepared  place.&quot; <br/><br/>Initiates  of  the  Egyptian  Mysteries  were  sometimes  called  scarabs;  again,  lions  and  panthers.  The <br/>scarab  was  the  emissary  of  the  sun,  symbolizing  light,  truth,  and  regeneration.  Stone  scarabs,  called <br/>heart  scarabs,  about  three  inches  long,  were  placed  in  the  heart  cavity  of  the  dead  when  that  organ <br/>was  removed  to  be  embalmed  separately  as  part  of  the  process  of  mummifying.  Some  maintain  that <br/>the  stone  beetles  were  merely  wrapped  in  the  winding  cloths  at  the  time  of  preparing  the  body  for <br/>eternal  preservation.  The  following  passage  concerning  this  appears  in  the  great  Egyptian  book  of <br/>initiation.  The  Book  of  the  Dead:  &quot;And  behold,  thou  shalt  make  a  scarab  of  green  stone,  which  shalt  be <br/>placed  in  the  breast  of  a  man,  and  it  shall  perform  for  him,  'the  opening  of  the  mouth.'&quot;  The  funeral <br/>rites  of  many  nations  bear  a  striking  resemblance  to  the  initiatory  ceremonies  of  their  Mysteries. <br/><br/>Ra,  the  god  of  the  sun,  had  three  important  aspects.  As  the  Creator  of  the  universe  he  was  symbolized <br/>by  the  head  of  a  scarab  and  was  called  Khepera,  which  signified  the  resurrection  of  the  soul  and  a  new <br/>life  at  the  end  of  the  mortal  span.  The  mummy  cases  of  the  Egyptian  dead  were  nearly  always <br/>ornamented  with  scarabs.  Usually  one  of  these  beetles,  with  outspread  wings,  was  painted  on  the <br/>mummy  case  directly  over  the  breast  of  the  dead.  The  finding  of  such  great  numbers  of  small  stone <br/>scarabs  indicates  that  they  were  a  favorite  article  of  adornment  among  the  Egyptians.  Because  of  its <br/>relationship  to  the  sun,  the  scarab  symbolized  the  divine  part  of  man's  nature.  The  fact  that  its <br/>beautiful  wings  were  concealed  under  its  glossy  shell  typified  the  winged  soul  of  man  hidden  within <br/>its  earthly  sheath.  The  Egyptian  soldiers  were  given  the  scarab  as  their  special  symbol  because  the <br/>ancients  believed  that  these  creatures  were  all  of  the  male  sex  and  consequently  appropriate  emblems <br/>of  virility,  strength,  and  courage. <br/><br/>Plutarch  noted  the  fact  that  the  scarab  rolled  its  peculiar  ball  of  dung  backwards,  while  the  insect <br/>itself  faced  the  opposite  direction.  This  made  it  an  especially  fitting  symbol  for  the  sun,  because  this <br/>orb  (according  to  Egyptian  astronomy)  was  rolling  from  west  to  east,  although  apparently  moving  in <br/>the  opposite  direction.  An  Egyptian  allegory  states  that  the  sunrise  is  caused  by  the  scarab  unfolding <br/><br/><br/>THE  MANTICHORA. <br/><br/><br/>From  Redgrave's  Bygone  Beliefs. <br/><br/><br/>The  most  remarkable  of  allegorical  creatures  was  the  mantichora,  which  Ctesias  describes  as  having  aflame-colored  body, <br/>lionlike  in  shape,  three  rows  of  teeth,  a  human  head  and  ears,  blue  eyes,  a  tail  ending  in  a  series  of  spikes  and  stings, <br/>thorny  and  scorpionlike,  and  a  voice  which  sounded  like  the  blare  of  trumpets.  This  sjmthetic  quadruped  ambled  into <br/>mediaeval  works  on  natural  history,  but,  though  seriously  considered,  had  never  been  seen,  because  it  inhabited <br/>inaccessible  regions  and  consequently  was  difficult  to  locate. <br/><br/><br/>The  flat  under  side  of  a  scarab  usually  bears  an  inscription  relating  to  the  dynasty  during  which  it  was  cut.  These  scarabs <br/>were  sometimes  used  as  seals.  Some  were  cut  from  ordinary  or  precious  stones;  others  were  made  of  clay,  baked  and <br/>glazed.  Occasionally  the  stone  scarabs  were  also  glazed.  The  majority  of  the  small  scarabs  are  pierced  as  though  originally <br/>used  as  beads.  Some  are  so  hard  that  they  will  cut  glass.  In  the  picture  above,  A  shows  top  and  side  views  of  the  scarab, <br/>and  B  and  B  the  under  surface  with  the  name  of  Men-ka-Ra  within  the  central  cartouche. <br/><br/><br/>its  wings,  which  stretch  out  as  glorious  colors  on  each  side  of  its  body&#x2014;the  solar  globe&#x2014;and  that  when <br/>it  folds  its  wings  under  its  dark  shell  at  sunset,  night  follows.  Khepera,  the  scarab-headed  aspect  of <br/>Ra,  is  often  symbolized  riding  through  the  sea  of  the  sky  in  a  wonderful  ship  called  the  Boat  of  the <br/>Sun. <br/><br/>The  scorpion  is  the  sjmibol  of  both  wisdom  and  self-destruction.  It  was  called  by  the  Egyptians  the <br/>creature  accursed;  the  time  of  year  when  the  sun  entered  the  sign  of  Scorpio  marked  the  beginning  of <br/>the  rulership  of  Typhon.  When  the  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac  were  used  to  represent  the  twelve <br/>Apostles  (although  the  reverse  is  true),  the  scorpion  was  assigned  to  Judas  Iscariot&#x2014; the  betrayer. <br/><br/>The  scorpion  stings  with  its  tail,  and  for  this  reason  it  has  been  called  a  backbiter,  a  false  and  deceitful <br/>thing.  Calmet,  in  his  Dictionary  of  the  Bible,  declares  the  scorpion  to  be  a  fit  emblem  of  the  wicked <br/>and  the  symbol  of  persecution.  The  dry  winds  of  Egypt  are  said  to  be  produced  by  Typhon,  who <br/>imparts  to  the  sand  the  blistering  heat  of  the  infernal  world  and  the  sting  of  the  scorpion.  This  insect <br/><br/><br/>ROYAL  EGYPTIAN  SCARAB. <br/><br/><br/>From  Hall's  Catalogue  of  Egyptian  Scarabs,  Etc.,  in  the  British  Museum. <br/><br/><br/>p.  87 <br/><br/><br/>was  also  the  symbol  of  the  spinal  fire  which,  according  to  the  Egyptian  Mysteries,  destroyed  man <br/>when  it  was  permitted  to  gather  at  the  base  of  his  spine  (the  tail  of  the  scorpion). The  red  star  Antares <br/>in  the  back  of  the  celestial  scorpion  was  considered  the  worst  light  in  the  heavens.  Kalb  alAkrab,  or <br/>the  heart  of  the  scorpion,  was  called  by  the  ancients  the  lieutenant  or  deputy  of  Mars.  (See  footnote  to <br/>Ptolemy's  Tetrabiblos.)  Antares  was  believed  to  impair  the  eyesight,  often  causing  blindness  if  it  rose <br/>over  the  horizon  when  a  child  was  born.  This  may  refer  again  to  the  sand  storm,  which  was  capable  of <br/>blinding  unwary  travelers. <br/><br/>The  scorpion  was  also  the  symbol  of  wisdom,  for  the  fire  which  it  controlled  was  capable  of <br/>illuminating  as  well  as  consuming.  Initiation  into  the  Greater  Mysteries  among  the  pagans  was  said  to <br/>take  place  only  in  the  sign  of  the  scorpion.  In  the  papyrus  of  Ani  (The  Book  of  the  Dead),  the  deceased <br/>likens  his  soul  to  a  scorpion,  saying:  &quot;I  am  a  swallow,  I  am  that  scorpion,  the  daughter  of  Ra!&quot; <br/>Elizabeth  Goldsmith,  in  her  treatise  on  Sex  Symbolism,  states  that  the  scorpions  were  a  &quot;symbol  of <br/>Selk,  the  Egyptian  goddess  of  writing,  and  also  [were]  revered  by  the  Babylonians  and  Assyrians  as <br/>guardians  of  the  gateway  of  the  sun.  Seven  scorpions  were  said  to  have  accompanied  Isis  when  she <br/>searched  for  the  remains  of  Osiris  scattered  by  Set&quot;  (Typhon). <br/><br/>In  his  Chaldean  Account  of  the  Genesis,  George  Smith,  copying  from  the  cuneiform  cylinders,  in <br/>describing  the  wanderings  of  the  hero  Izdubar  (Nimrod),  throws  some  light  on  the  scorpion  god  who <br/>guards  the  sun.  The  tablet  which  he  translated  is  not  perfect,  but  the  meaning  is  fairly  clear:  &quot;*  *  * <br/>who  each  day  guard  the  rising  sun.  Their  crown  was  at  the  lattice  of  heaven,  under  hell  their  feet  were <br/>placed  [the  spinal  column].  The  scorpion  man  guarded  the  gate,  burning  with  terribleness,  their <br/>appearance  was  like  death,  the  might  of  his  fear  shook  the  forest.  At  the  rising  of  the  sun  and  the <br/>setting  of  the  sun,  they  guarded  the  sun;  Izdubar  saw  them  and  fear  and  terror  came  into  his  face.&quot; <br/>Among  the  early  Latins  there  was  a  machine  of  war  called  the  scorpion.  It  was  used  for  firing  arrows <br/>and  probably  obtained  its  name  from  a  long  beam,  resembling  a  scorpion's  tail,  which  flew  up  to  hurl <br/>the  arrows.  The  missiles  discharged  by  this  machine  were  also  called  scorpions. <br/><br/>The  butterfly  (under  the  name  of  Psyche,  a  beautiful  maiden  with  wings  of  opalescent  light) <br/>symbolizes  the  human  soul  because  of  the  stages  it  passes  through  in  order  to  unfold  its  power  of <br/>flight.  The  three  divisions  through  which  the  butterfly  passes  in  its  unfoldment  resemble  closely  the <br/>three  degrees  of  the  Mystery  School,  which  degrees  are  regarded  as  consummating  the  unfoldment  of <br/>man  by  giving  him  emblematic  wings  by  which  he  may  soar  to  the  skies.  Unregenerate  man,  ignorant <br/>and  helpless,  is  symbolized  by  the  stage  between  ovum  and  larva;  the  disciple,  seeking  truth  and <br/>dwelling  in  medication,  by  the  second  stage,  from  larva  to  pupa,  at  which  time  the  insect  enters  its <br/>chrysalis  (the  tomb  of  the  Mysteries);  the  third  stage,  from  pupa  to  imago  (wherein  the  perfect <br/>butterfly  comes  forth),  typifies  the  unfolded  enlightened  soul  of  the  initiate  rising  from  the  tomb  of <br/>his  baser  nature. <br/><br/>Night  moths  typify  the  secret  wisdom,  because  they  are  hard  to  discover  and  are  concealed  by  the <br/>darkness  (ignorance).  Some  are  emblems  of  death,  asAcherontia  atropos,  the  death's-head  moth, <br/>which  has  a  marking  on  its  body  somewhat  like  a  human  skull.  The  death-watch  beetle,  which  was <br/>believed  to  give  warning  of  approaching  death  by  a  peculiar  ticking  sound,  is  another  instance  of <br/>insects  involved  in  human  affairs. <br/><br/>Opinions  differ  concerning  the  spider.  Its  shape  makes  it  an  appropriate  emblem  of  the  nerve  plexus <br/>and  ganglia  of  the  human  body.  Some  Europeans  consider  it  extremely  bad  luck  to  kill  a  spider- <br/>possibly  because  it  is  looked  upon  as  an  emissary  of  the  Evil  One,  whom  no  person  desires  to  offend. <br/>There  is  a  mystery  concerning  all  poisonous  creatures,  especially  insects.  Paracelsus  taught  that  the <br/>spider  was  the  medium  for  a  powerful  but  evil  force  which  the  Black  Magicians  used  in  their  nefarious <br/>undertakings. <br/><br/><br/>Certain  plants,  minerals,  and  animals  have  been  sacred  among  all  the  nations  of  the  earth  because  of <br/>their  peculiar  sensitiveness  to  the  astral  fire~a  mysterious  agency  in  Nature  which  the  scientific  world <br/>has  contacted  through  its  manifestations  as  electricity  and  magnetism.  Lodestone  and  radium  in  the <br/>mineral  world  and  various  parasitic  growths  in  the  plant  kingdom  are  strangely  susceptible  to  this <br/>cosmic  electric  fire,  or  universal  life  force.  The  magicians  of  the  Middle  Ages  surrounded  themselves <br/>with  such  creatures  as  bats,  spiders,  cats,  snakes,  and  monkeys,  because  they  were  able  to  appropriate <br/>the  life  forces  of  these  species  and  use  them  to  the  attainment  of  their  own  ends.  Some  ancient <br/>schools  of  wisdom  taught  that  all  poisonous  insects  and  reptiles  are  germinated  out  of  the  evil  nature <br/>of  man,  and  that  when  intelligent  human  beings  no  longer  breed  hate  in  their  own  souls  there  will  be <br/>no  more  ferocious  animals,  loathsome  diseases,  or  poisonous  plants  and  insects. <br/><br/>Among  the  American  Indians  is  the  legend  of  a  &quot;Spider  Man,&quot;  whose  web  connected  the  heaven <br/>worlds  with  the  earth.  The  secret  schools  of  India  symbolize  certain  of  the  gods  who  labored  with  the <br/>universe  during  its  making  as  connecting  the  realms  of  light  with  those  of  darkness  by  means  of  webs. <br/>Therefore  the  builders  of  the  cosmic  system  who  held  the  embryonic  universe  together  with  threads  of <br/>invisible  force  were  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Spider  Gods  and  their  ruler  was  designated  The <br/>Great  Spider. <br/><br/>The  beehive  is  found  in  Masonry  as  a  reminder  that  in  diligence  and  labor  for  a  common  good  true <br/>happiness  and  prosperity  are  found.  The  bee  is  a  symbol  of  wisdom,  for  as  this  tiny  insect  collects <br/>pollen  from  the  flowers,  so  men  may  extract  wisdom  from  the  experiences  of  daily  life.  The  bee  is <br/>sacred  to  the  goddess  Venus  and,  according  to  mystics,  it  is  one  of  several  forms  of  life  which  came  to <br/>the  earth  from  the  planet  Venus  millions  of  years  ago.  Wheat  and  bananas  are  said  to  be  of  similar <br/>origin.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  origin  of  these  three  forms  of  life  cannot  be  traced.  The  fact  that <br/>bees  are  ruled  by  queens  is  one  reason  why  this  insect  is  considered  a  sacred  feminine  symbol. <br/><br/>In  India  the  god  Prana~the  personification  of  the  universal  life  force&#x2014;is  sometimes  shown <br/>surrounded  by  a  circle  of  bees.  Because  of  its  importance  in  poUenizing  flowers,  the  bee  is  the <br/>accepted  symbol  of  the  generative  power.  At  one  time  the  bee  was  the  emblem  of  the  French  kings. <br/>The  rulers  of  France  wore  robes  embroidered  with  bees,  and  the  canopies  of  their  thrones  were <br/>decorated  with  gigantic  figures  of  these  insects. <br/><br/>The  fly  symbolizes  the  tormentor,  because  of  the  annoyance  it  causes  to  animals.  The  Chaldean  god <br/>Baal  was  often  called  Baal-Zebul,  or  the  god  of  the  dwelling  place.  The  word  zebub,  or  zabab,  means  a <br/>fly,  and  Baal-Zebul  became  Baalzebub,  or  Beelzebub,  a  word  which  was  loosely  translated  to  mean <br/>Jupiter's  fly.  The  fly  was  looked  upon  as  a  form  of  the  divine  power,  because  of  its  ability  to  destroy <br/>decaying  substances  and  thus  promote  health.  The  fly  may  have  obtained  its  name  Zebub  from  its <br/>peculiar  buzzing  or  humming.  Inman  believes  that  Baalzebub,  which  the  Jews  ridiculed  as  My  Lord  of <br/>Flies,  really  means  My  Lord  Who  Hums  or  Murmurs. <br/><br/>Inman  recalls  the  singing  Memnon  on  the  Egyptian  desert,  a  tremendous  figure  with  an  ^Eolian  harp <br/>on  the  top  of  its  head.  When  the  wind  blows  strongly  this  great  Statue  sighs,  or  hums.  The  Jews <br/>changed  Baalzebub  into  Beelzebub,  and  made  him  their  prince  of  devils  by  interpreting  dsemon  as <br/>&quot;demon.&quot;  Naudseus,  in  defending  Virgil  from  accusations  of  sorcery,  attempted  a  wholesale  denial  of <br/>the  miracles  supposedly  performed  by  Virgil  and  produced  enough  evidence  to  convict  the  poet  on  all <br/>counts.  Among  other  strange  fears,  Virgil  fashioned  a  fly  out  of  brass,  and  after  certain  mysterious <br/>ceremonies,  placed  it  over  one  of  the  gates  of  Naples.  As  a  result,  no  flies  entered  the  city  for  more <br/>than  eight  years. <br/><br/>REPTILES <br/><br/>The  serpent  was  chosen  as  the  head  of  the  reptilian  family.  Serpent  worship  in  some  form  has <br/>permeated  nearly  all  parts  of  the <br/><br/><br/>THE  FLEUR-DE-LIS. <br/><br/><br/>The  bee  was  used  as,  a  symbol  of  royalty  by  the  immortal  Charlemagne,  and  it  is  probable  that  the  fleur-de-lis,  or  lily  of <br/>France,  is  merely  a  conventionalized  bee  and  not  a  flower.  There  is  an  ancient  Greek  legend  to  the  effect  that  the  nine <br/>Muses  occasionally  assumed  the  form  of  bees. <br/><br/><br/>THE  SCORPION  TALISMAN. <br/><br/><br/>From  Paracelsus'  Archidoxes  Magica. <br/><br/>The  scorpion  often  appears  upon  the  talismans  and  charms  of  the  Middle  Ages.  This  hieroglyphic  Arac/inida  was <br/>supposed  to  have  the  power  of  curing  disease.  The  scorpion  shown  above  was  composed  of  several  metals,  and  was  made <br/>under  certain  planetary  configurations.  Paracelsus  advised  that  it  be  worn  by  those  suffering  from  any  derangement  of  the <br/>reproductive  system. <br/><br/>p.  88 <br/><br/>earth.  The  serpent  mounds  of  the  American  Indian;  the  carved-stone  snakes  of  Central  and  South <br/>America;  the  hooded  cobras  of  India;  Python,  the  great  snake  o  the  Greeks;  the  sacred  serpents  of  the <br/>Druids;  the  Midgard  snake  of  Scandinavia;  the  Nagas  of  Burma,  Siam,  and  Cambodia;  the  brazen <br/>serpent  of  the  Jews;  the  mystic  serpent  of  Orpheus;  the  snakes  at  the  oracle;  of  Delphi  twining <br/>themselves  around  the  tripod  upon  which  the  Pythian  priestess  sat,  the  tripod  itself  being  in  the  form <br/>of  twisted  serpents;  the  sacred  serpents  preserved  in  the  Egyptian  temples;  the  Urseus  coiled  upon  the <br/>foreheads  of  the  Pharaohs  and  priests; &#x2014;all  these  bear  witness  to  the  universal  veneration  in  which  the <br/>snake  was  held.  In  the  ancient  Mysteries  the  serpent  entwining  a  staff  was  the  symbol  of  the  physician. <br/><br/><br/>The  serpent-wound  staff  of  Hermes  remains  the  emblem  of  the  medical  profession.  Among  nearly  all <br/><br/>these  ancient  peoples  the  serpent  was  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  wisdom  or  salvation.  The  antipathy <br/>which  Christendom  feels  towards  the  snake  is  based  upon  the  little-understood  allegory  of  the  Garden <br/>of  Eden. <br/><br/>The  serpent  is  true  to  the  principle  of  wisdom,  for  it  tempts  man  to  the  knowledge  of  himself. <br/>Therefore  the  knowledge  of  self  resulted  from  man's  disobedience  to  the  Demiurgus,  Jehovah.  How <br/>the  serpent  came  to  be  in  the  garden  of  the  Lord  after  God  had  declared  that  all  creatures  which  He <br/>had  made  during  the  six  days  of  creation  were  good  has  not  been  satisfactorily  answered  by  the <br/>interpreters  of  Scripture.  The  tree  that  grows  in  the  midst  of  the  garden  is  the  spinal  fire;  the <br/>knowledge  of  the  use  of  that  spinal  fire  is  the  gift  of  the  great  serpent.  Notwithstanding  statements  to <br/>the  contrary,  the  serpent  is  the  symbol  and  prototype  of  the  Universal  Savior,  who  redeems  the <br/>worlds  by  giving  creation  the  knowledge  of  itself  and  the  realization  of  good  and  evil.  If  this  be  not  so, <br/>why  did  Moses  raise  a  brazen  serpent  upon  a  cross  in  the  wilderness  that  all  who  looked  upon  it  might <br/>be  saved  from  the  sting  of  the  lesser  snakes?  Was  not  the  brazen  serpent  a  prophecy  of  the  crucified <br/>Man  to  come?  If  the  serpent  be  only  a  thing  of  evil,  why  did  Christ  instruct  His  disciples  to  be  as  wise <br/>as  serpents? <br/><br/>The  accepted  theory  that  the  serpent  is  evil  cannot  be  substantiated.  It  has  long  been  viewed  as  the <br/>emblem  of  immortality.  It  is  the  symbol  of  reincarnation,  or  metempsychosis,  because  it  annually <br/>sheds  its  skin,  reappearing,  as  it  were,  in  a  new  body.  There  is  an  ancient  superstition  to  the  effect <br/>that  snakes  never  die  except  by  violence  and  that,  if  uninjured,  they  would  live  forever.  It  was  also <br/>believed  that  snakes  swallowed  themselves,  and  this  resulted  in  their  being  considered  emblematic  of <br/>the  Supreme  Creator,  who  periodically  reabsorbed  His  universe  back  into  Himself. <br/><br/>In  Isis  Unveiled,  H.  P.  Blavatsky  makes  this  significant  statement  concerning  the  origin  of  serpent <br/>worship:  &quot;Before  our  globe  had  become  egg-shaped  or  round  it  was  a  long  trail  of  cosmic  dust  or  fire- <br/>mist,  moving  and  writhing  like  a  serpent.  This,  say  the  explanations,  was  the  Spirit  of  God  moving  on <br/>the  chaos  until  its  breath  had  incubated  cosmic  matter  and  made  it  assume  the  annular  shape  of  a <br/>serpent  with  its  tail  in  its  month&#x2014;emblem  of  eternity  in  its  spiritual  and  of  our  world  in  its  physical <br/>sense.&quot; <br/><br/>The  seven-headed  snake  represents  the  Supreme  Deity  manifesting  through  His  Elohim,  or  Seven <br/>Spirits,  by  whose  aid  He  established  His  universe.  The  coils  of  the  snake  have  been  used  by  the <br/>pagans  to  symbolize  the  motion  and  also  the  orbits  of  the  celestial  bodies,  and  it  is  probable  that  the <br/>symbol  of  the  serpent  twisted  around  the  egg&#x2014; which  was  common  to  many  of  the  ancient  Mystery <br/>schools&#x2014;represented  both  the  apparent  motion  of  the  sun  around  the  earth,  and  the  bands  of  astral <br/>light,  or  the  great  magical  agent,  which  move  about  the  planet  incessantly. <br/><br/>Electricity  was  commonly  symbolized  by  the  serpent  because  of  its  motion.  Electricity  passing <br/>between  the  poles  of  a  spark  gap  is  serpentine  in  its  motion.  Force  projected  through  atmosphere  was <br/>called  The  Great  Snake.  Being  symbolic  of  universal  force,  the  serpent  was  emblematic  of  both  good <br/>and  evil.  Force  can  tear  down  as  rapidly  as  it  can  build  up.  The  serpent  with  its  tail  in  its  mouth  is  the <br/>symbol  of  eternity,  for  in  this  position  the  body  of  the  reptile  has  neither  beginning  nor  end.  The  head <br/>and  tail  represent  the  positive  and  negative  poles  of  the  cosmic  life  circuit.  The  initiates  of  the <br/>Mysteries  were  often  referred  to  as  serpents,  and  their  wisdom  was  considered  analogous  to  the <br/>divinely  inspired  power  of  the  snake.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  title  &quot;Winged  Serpents&quot;  (the <br/>Seraphim?)  was  given  to  one  of  the  invisible  hierarchies  that  labored  with  the  earth  during  its  early <br/>formation. <br/><br/>There  is  a  legend  that  in  the  beginning  of  the  world  winged  serpents  reigned  upon  the  earth.  These <br/><br/>were  probably  the  demigods  which  antedate  the  historical  civilization  of  every  nation.  The  symbolic <br/>relationship  between  the  sun  and  the  serpent  found  literal  witness  in  the  fact  that  life  remains  in  the <br/><br/><br/>snake  until  sunset,  even  though  it  be  cut  into  a  dozen  parts.  The  Hopi  Indians  consider  the  serpent  to <br/><br/>be  in  close  communication  with  the  Earth  Spirit.  Therefore,  at  the  time  of  their  annual  snake  dance <br/>they  send  their  prayers  to  the  Earth  Spirit  by  first  specially  sanctifying  large  numbers  of  these  reptiles <br/>and  then  liberating  them  to  return  to  the  earth  with  the  prayers  of  the  tribe. <br/><br/>The  great  rapidity  of  motion  manifested  by  lizards  has  caused  them  to  be  associated  with  Mercury, <br/>the  Messenger  of  the  Gods,  whose  winged  feet  traveled  infinite  distances  almost  instantaneously.  A <br/>point  which  must  not  be  overlooked  in  connection  with  reptiles  in  symbolism  is  clearly  brought  out  by <br/>the  eminent  scholar.  Dr.  H.  E.  Santee,  in  his  Anatomy  of  the  Brain  and  Spinal  Cord:  &quot;In  reptiles <br/>there  are  two  pineal  bodies,  an  anterior  and  a  posterior,  of  which  the  posterior  remains  undeveloped <br/>but  the  anterior  forms  a  rudimentary,  cyclopean  eye.  In  the  Hatteria,  a  New  Zealand  lizard,  it  projects <br/>through  the  parietal  foramen  and  presents  an  imperfect  lens  and  retina  and,  in  its  long  stalk,  nerve <br/>fibers.&quot; <br/><br/>Crocodiles  were  regarded  by  the  Egyptians  both  as  symbols  of  Typhon  and  emblems  of  the  Supreme <br/>Deity,  of  the  latter  because  while  under  water  the  crocodile  is  capable  of  seeing&#x2014;Plutarch  asserts&#x2014; <br/>though  its  eyes  are  covered  by  a  thin  membrane.  The  Egyptians  declared  that  no  matter  how  far  away <br/>the  crocodile  laid  its  eggs,  the  Nile  would  reach  up  to  them  in  its  next  inundation,  this  reptile  being <br/>endowed  with  a  mysterious  sense  capable  of  making  known  the  extent  of  the  flood  months  before  it <br/>took  place.  There  were  two  kinds  of  crocodiles.  The  larger  and  more  ferocious  was  hated  by  the <br/>Egyptians,  for  they  likened  it  to  the  nature  of  Typhon,  their  destroying  demon.  Typhon  waited  to <br/>devour  all  who  failed  to  pass  the  judgment  of  the  Dead,  which  rite  took  place  in  the  Hall  of  Justice <br/>between  the  earth  and  the  Elysian  Fields.  Anthony  Todd  Thomson  thus  describes  the  good  treatment <br/>accorded  the  smaller  and  tamer  crocodiles,  which  the  Egyptians  accepted  as  personifications  of  good: <br/>&quot;They  were  fed  daily  and  occasionally  had  mulled  wine  poured  down  their  throats.  Their  ears  were <br/>ornamented  with  rings  of  gold  and  precious  stones,  and  their  forefeet  adorned  with  bracelets.&quot; <br/><br/>To  the  Chinese  the  turtle  was  a  symbol  of  longevity.  At  a  temple  in  Singapore  a  number  of  sacred <br/>turtles  are  kept,  their  age  recorded  by  carvings  on  their  shells.  The  American  Indians  use  the  ridge <br/>down  the  back  of  the  turtle  shell  as  a  symbol  of  the  Great  Divide  between  life  and  death.  The  turtle  is  a <br/>symbol  of  wisdom  because  it  retires  into  itself  and  is  its  own  protection.  It  is  also  a  phallic  symbol,  as <br/>its  relation  to  long  life  would  signify.  The  Hindus  symbolized  the  universe  as  being  supported  on  the <br/>backs  of  four  great  elephants  who,  in  turn,  are  standing  upon  an  immense  turtle  which  is  crawling <br/>continually  through  chaos. <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  sphinx,  the  Greek  centaur,  and  the  Assyrian  man -bull  have  much  in  common.  All  are <br/>composite  creatures  combining  human  and  animal  members;  in  the  Mysteries  all  signify  the <br/>composite  nature  of  man  and  subtly  refer  to  the  hierarchies  of  celestial  beings  that  have  charge  of  the <br/>destiny  of  mankind.  These  hierarchies  are  the  twelve  holy  animals  now  known  as  constellations&#x2014;star <br/>groups  which  are  merely  symbols  of  impersonal  spiritual  impulses.  Chiron,  the  centaur,  teaching  the <br/>sons  of  men,  symbolizes  the  intelligences  of  the  constellation  of  Sagittarius,  who  were  the  custodians <br/>of  the  secret  doctrine  while  (geocentrically)  the  sun  was  passing  through  the  sign  of  Gemini.  The  five- <br/>footed  Assyrian  man-bull  with  the  wings  of  an  eagle  and  the  head  of  a  man  is  a  reminder  that  the <br/>invisible  nature  of  man  has  the  wings  of  a  god,  the  head  of  a  man,  and  the  body  of  a  beast.  The  same <br/>concept  was  expressed  through  the  sphinx&#x2014; that  armed  guardian  of  the  Mysteries  who,  crouching  at <br/>the  gate  of  the  temple,  denied  entrance  to  the  profane.  Thus  placed  between  man  and  his  divine <br/>possibilities,  the  sphinx  also  represented  the  secret  doctrine  itself.  Children's  fairy  stories  abound <br/>with  descriptions  of  symbolic  monsters,  for  nearly  all  such  tales  are  based  upon  the  ancient  mystic <br/>folklore. <br/><br/><br/>THE  URiEUS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  CEdipus^Egyptiacus. <br/><br/>The  spinal  cord  was  symbolized  by  a  snake,  and  the  serpent  coiled  upon  the  foreheads  of  the  Egyptian  initiates <br/>represented  the  Divine  Fire  which  had  crawled  serpentlike  up  the  Tree  of  Life. <br/><br/><br/>GOOD  AND  EVIL  CONTENDING  FOR  THE  UNIVERSAL  EGG. <br/><br/>From  Maurice's  Indian  Antiquities. <br/><br/>Both  Mithras,  the  Persian  Redeemer,  and  Serapis,  the  Egyptian  God  of  the  Earth,  are  symbolized  by  serpents  coiled  about <br/>their  bodies.  This  remarkable  drawing  shows  the  good  and  evil  principles  of  Persia&#x2014; Ahura-Mazda  and  Ahriman&#x2014; <br/>contending  for  the  Egg  of  the  Earth,  which  each  trying  to  wrench  from  the  teeth  of  the  other. <br/><br/><br/>p.  89 <br/><br/>Fishes,  Insects,  Animals,  Reptiles  and <br/><br/>Birds <br/><br/>(Part  Two) <br/><br/>AS  appropriate  emblems  of  various  human  and  divine  attributes  birds  were  included  in  religious  and <br/>philosophic  symbolism  that  of  pagans  and  of  Christians  alike.  Cruelty  was  signified  by  the  buzzard; <br/>courage  by  the  eagle;  self-sacrifice  by  the  pelican;  and  pride  by  the  peacock.  The  ability  of  birds  to <br/>leave  the  earth  and  fly  aloft  toward  the  source  of  light  has  resulted  in  their  being  associated  with <br/>aspiration,  purity,  and  beauty.  Wings  were  therefore  often  added  to  various  terrene  creatures  in  an <br/>effort  to  suggest  transcendency.  Because  their  habitat  was  among  the  branches  of  the  sacred  trees  in <br/>the  hearts  of  ancient  forests,  birds  were  also  regarded  as  the  appointed  messengers  of  the  tree  spirits <br/>and  Nature  gods  dwelling  in  these  consecrated  groves,  and  through  their  clear  notes  the  gods <br/>themselves  were  said  to  speak.  Many  myths  have  been  fabricated  to  explain  the  brilliant  plumage  of <br/>birds.  A  familiar  example  is  the  story  of  Juno's  peacock,  in  whose  tail  feathers  were  placed  the  eyes  of <br/>Argus.  Numerous  American  Indian  legends  also  deal  with  birds  and  the  origin  of  the  various  colors  of <br/>feathers.  The  Navahos  declare  that  when  all  living  things  climbed  to  the  stalk  of  a  bamboo  to  escape <br/>the  Flood,  the  wild  turkey  was  on  the  lowest  branch  and  his  tail  feathers  trailed  in  the  water;  hence <br/>the  color  was  all  washed  out. <br/><br/>Gravitation,  which  is  a  law  in  the  material  world,  is  the  impulse  toward  the  center  of  materiality; <br/>levitation,  which  is  a  law  in  the  spiritual  world,  is  the  impulse  toward  the  center  of  spirituality. <br/>Seeming  to  be  capable  of  neutralizing  the  effect  of  gravity,  the  bird  was  said  to  partake  of  a  nature <br/>superior  to  other  terrestrial  creation;  and  its  feathers,  because  of  their  sustaining  power,  came  to  be <br/>accepted  as  symbols  of  divinity,  courage,  and  accomplishment.  A  notable  example  is  the  dignity <br/>attached  to  eagle  feathers  by  the  American  Indians,  among  whom  they  are  insignia  of  merit.  Angels <br/>have  been  invested  with  wings  because,  like  birds,  they  were  considered  to  be  the  intermediaries <br/>between  the  gods  and  men  and  to  inhabit  the  air  or  middle  kingdom  betwixt  heaven  and  earth.  As  the <br/>dome  of  the  heavens  was  likened  to  a  skull  in  the  Gothic  Mysteries,  so  the  birds  which  flew  across  the <br/>sky  were  regarded  as  thoughts  of  the  Deity.  For  this  reason  Odin's  two  messenger  ravens  were  called <br/>Hugin  and  Munin&#x2014; thought  and  memory. <br/><br/>Among  the  Greeks  and  Romans,  the  eagle  was  the  appointed  bird  of  Jupiter  and  consequently <br/>signified  the  swiftly  moving  forces  of  the  Demiurgus;  hence  it  was  looked  upon  as  the  mundane  lord <br/>of  the  birds,  in  contradistinction  to  the  phoenix,  which  was  symbolic  of  the  celestial  ruler.  The  eagle <br/>typified  the  sun  in  its  material  phase  and  also  the  immutable  Demiurgic  law  beneath  which  all  mortal <br/>creatures  must  bend.  The  eagle  was  also  the  Hermetic  symbol  of  sulphur,  and  signified  the <br/>mysterious  fire  of  Scorpio&#x2014; the  most  profoundly  significant  sign  of  the  zodiac  and  the  Gate  of  the <br/>Great  Mystery.  Being  one  of  the  three  symbols  of  Scorpio,  the  eagle,  like  the  Goat  of  Mendes,  was  an <br/>emblem  of  the  theurgic  art  and  the  secret  processes  by  which  the  infernal  fire  of  the  scorpion  was <br/>transmuted  into  the  spiritual  light-fire  of  the  gods. <br/><br/>Among  certain  American  Indian  tribes  the  thunderbird  is  held  in  peculiar  esteem.  This  divine <br/>creature  is  said  to  live  above  the  clouds;  the  flapping  of  its  wings  causes  the  rumbling  which <br/>accompanies  storms,  while  the  flashes  from  its  eyes  are  the  lightning.  Birds  were  used  to  signify  the <br/>vital  breath;  and  among  the  Egyptians,  mysterious  hawklike  birds  with  human  heads,  and  carrying  in <br/>their  claws  the  symbols  of  immortality,  are  often  shown  hovering  as  emblems  of  the  liberated  soul <br/>over  the  mummified  bodies  of  the  dead.  In  Egypt  the  hawk  was  the  sacred  symbol  of  the  sun;  and  Ra, <br/>Osiris,  and  Horns  are  often  depicted  with  the  heads  of  hawks.  The  cock,  or  rooster,  was  a  symbol  of <br/><br/><br/>Cashmala  (Cadmillus)  in  the  Samothracian  Mysteries,  and  is  also  a  phallic  symbol  sacred  to  the  sun. <br/>It  was  accepted  by  the  Greeks  as  the  emblem  of  Ares  (Mars)  and  typified  watchfulness  and  defense. <br/>When  placed  in  the  center  of  a  weather  vane  it  signifies  the  sun  in  the  midst  of  the  four  corners  of <br/>creation.  The  Greeks  sacrificed  a  rooster  to  the  gods  at  the  time  of  entering  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries. <br/>Sir  Francis  Bacon  is  supposed  to  have  died  as  the  result  of  stuffing  a  fowl  with  snow.  May  this  not <br/>signify  Bacon's  initiation  into  the  pagan  Mysteries  which  still  existed  in  his  day? <br/><br/>Both  the  peacock  and  the  ibis  were  objects  of  veneration  because  they  destroyed  the  poisonous <br/>reptiles  which  were  popularly  regarded  as  the  emissaries  of  the  infernal  gods.  Because  of  the  myriad <br/>of  eyes  in  its  tail  feathers  the  peacock  was  accepted  as  the  symbol  of  wisdom,  and  on  account  of  its <br/>general  appearance  it  was  often  confused  with  the  fabled  phoenix  of  the  Mysteries.  There  is  a  curious <br/>belief  that  the  flesh  of  the  peacock  will  not  putrefy  even  though  kept  for  a  considerable  time.  As  an <br/>outgrowth  of  this  belief  the  peacock  became  the  emblem  of  immortality,  because  the  spiritual  nature <br/>of  man&#x2014;like  the  flesh  of  this  bird&#x2014;is  incorruptible. <br/><br/>The  Egyptians  paid  divine  honors  to  the  ibis  and  it  was  a  cardinal  crime  to  kill  one,  even  by  accident. <br/>It  was  asserted  that  the  ibis  could  live  only  in  Egypt  and  that  if  transported  to  a  foreign  country  it <br/>would  die  of  grief.  The  Egyptians  declared  this  bird  to  be  the  preserver  of  crops  and  especially  worthy <br/>of  veneration  because  it  drove  out  the  winged  serpents  of  Libya  which  the  wind  blew  into  Egypt.  The <br/>ibis  was  sacred  to  Thoth,  and  when  its  head  and  neck  were  tucked  under  its  wing  its  body  closely <br/>resembled  a  human  heart.  (See  Montfaucon's  Antiquities.)  The  black  and  white  ibis  was  sacred  to  the <br/>moon;  but  all  forms  were  revered  because  they  destroyed  crocodile  eggs,  the  crocodile  being  a  symbol <br/>of  the  detested  Typhon. <br/><br/>Nocturnal  birds  were  appropriate  symbols  of  both  sorcery  and  the  secret  divine  sciences:  sorcery <br/>because  black  magic  cannot  function  in  the  light  of  truth  (day)  and  is  powerful  only  when  surrounded <br/>by  ignorance  (night);  and  the  divine  sciences  because  those  possessing  the  arcana  are  able  to  see <br/>through  the  darkness  of  ignorance  and  materiality.  Owls  and  bats  were  consequently  often  associated <br/>with  either  witchcraft  or  wisdom.  The  goose  was  an  emblem  of  the  first  primitive  substance  or <br/>condition  from  which  and  within  which  the  worlds  were  fashioned.  In  the  Mysteries,  the  universe  was <br/>likened  to  an  egg  which  the  Cosmic  Goose  had  laid  in  space.  Because  of  its  blackness  the  crow  was  the <br/>symbol  of  chaos  or  the  chaotic  darkness  preceding  the  light  of  creation.  The  grace  and  purity  of  the <br/>swan  were  emblematic  of  the  spiritual  grace  and  purity  of  the  initiate.  This  bird  also  represented  the <br/>Mysteries  which  unfolded  these  qualities  in  humanity.  This  explains  the  allegories  of  the  gods  (the <br/>secret  wisdom)  incarnating  in  the  body  of  a  swan  (the  initiate). <br/><br/>Being  scavengers,  the  vulture,  the  buzzard,  and  the  condor  signified  that  form  of  divine  power  which <br/>by  disposing  of  refuse  and  other  matter  dangerous  to  the  life  and  health  of  humanity  cleanses  and <br/>purifies  the  lower  spheres.  These  birds  were  therefore  adopted  as  symbols  of  the  disintegrative <br/>processes  which  accomplish  good  while  apparently  destroying,  and  by  some  religions  have  been <br/>mistakenly  regarded  as  evil.  Birds  such  as  the  parrot  and  raven  were  accorded  veneration  because, <br/>being  able  to  mimic  the  human  voice,  they  were  looked  upon  as  links  between  the  human  and  animal <br/>kingdoms. <br/><br/>The  dove,  accepted  by  Christianity  as  the  emblem  of  the  Holy  Ghost,  is  an  extremely  ancient  and <br/>highly  revered  pagan  yonic  emblem.  In  many  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  it  represented  the  third  person <br/>of  the  Creative  Triad,  or  the  Fabricator  of  the  world.  As  the  lower  worlds  were  brought  into  existence <br/>through  a  generative  process,  so  the  dove  has  been  associated  with  those  deities  identified  with  the <br/>procreative  functions.  It  is  sacred  to  Astarte,  Cybele,  Isis,  Venus,  Juno,  Mylitta,  and  Aphrodite.  On <br/>account  of  its  gentleness  and  devotion  to  its  young,  the  dove  was  looked  upon  as  the  embodiment  of <br/>the  maternal  instinct.  The  dove  is  also  an  emblem  of  wisdom,  for  it  represents  the  power  and  order  by <br/>which  the  lower  worlds  are  maintained.  It  has  long  been  accepted  as  a  messenger  of  the  divine  will, <br/>and  signifies  the  activity  of  God. <br/><br/><br/>The  name  dove  has  been  given  to  oracles  and  to  prophets.  &quot;The  true  name  of  the  dove  was  lonah  or <br/>Idnas;  it  was  a  very  sacred  emblem,  and  atone  time  almost  universally  received;  it  was  adopted  by  the <br/>Hebrews;  and  the  mystic  Dove  was  regarded  as  a  symbol <br/><br/><br/>THE  PHCENIX  ON  ITS  NEST  OF  FLAMES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Lycosthenes'  Prodigiorum,  ac  Ostentorum  Chronicon. <br/><br/>The  phoenix  is  the  most  celebrated  of  all  the  symbolic  creatures  fabricated  by  the  ancient  Mysteries  for  the  purpose  of <br/>concealing  the  great  truths  of  esoteric  philosophy.  Though  modern  scholars  of  natural  history  declare  the  existence  of  the <br/>phoenix  to  be  purely  mythical,  Pliny  describes  the  capture  of  one  of  these  birds  and  it  exhibition  in  the  Roman  Forum <br/>during  the  reign  of  the  Emperor  Claudius. <br/><br/>p.  90 <br/><br/>from  the  days  of  Noah  by  all  those  who  were  of  the  Church  of  God.  The  prophet  sent  to  Ninevah  as <br/>God's  messenger  was  called  Jonah  or  the  Dove;  our  Lord's  forerunner,  the  Baptist,  was  called  in <br/>Greek  by  the  name  of  loannes;  and  so  was  the  Apostle  of  Love,  the  author  Of  the  fourth  Gospel  and  of <br/>the  Apocalypse,  named  loannes.&quot;  (Bryant's  Ana/ysis  of  Ancient  Mythology.) <br/><br/>In  Masonry  the  dove  is  the  symbol  of  purity  and  innocence.  It  is  significant  that  in  the  pagan <br/>Mysteries  the  dove  of  Venus  was  crucified  upon  the  four  spokes  of  a  great  wheel,  thus  foreshadowing <br/>the  mystery  of  the  crucified  Lord  of  Love.  Although  Mohammed  drove  the  doves  from  the  temple  at <br/>Mecca,  occasionally  he  is  depicted  with  a  dove  sitting  upon  his  shoulder  as  the  symbol  of  divine <br/>inspiration.  In  ancient  times  the  effigies  of  doves  were  placed  upon  the  heads  of  scepters  to  signify <br/>that  those  bearing  them  were  overshadowed  by  divine  prerogative.  In  mediaeval  art,  the  dove <br/>frequently  was  pictured  as  an  emblem  of  divine  benediction. <br/><br/>THE  PHCENIX <br/><br/>Clement,  one  of  the  ante-Nicaean  Fathers,  describes,  in  the  first  century  after  Christ,  the  peculiar <br/>nature  and  habits  of  the  phoenix,  in  this  wise:  &quot;There  is  a  certain  bird  which  is  called  a  Phoenix.  This  is <br/>the  only  one  of  its  kind  and  lives  five  hundred  years.  And  when  the  time  of  its  dissolution  draws  near <br/>that  it  must  die,  it  builds  itself  a  nest  of  frankincense,  and  myrrh,  and  other  spices,  into  which,  when <br/>the  time  is  fulfilled,  it  enters  and  dies.  But  as  the  flesh  decays  a  certain  kind  of  worm  is  produced, <br/>which,  being  nourished  by  the  juices  of  the  dead  bird,  brings  forth  feathers.  Then,  when  it  has <br/>acquired  strength,  it  takes  up  that  nest  in  which  are  the  bones  of  its  parent,  and  bearing  these  it <br/>passes  from  the  land  of  Arabia  into  Egypt,  to  the  city  called  Heliopolis.  And,  in  open  day,  flying  in  the <br/><br/><br/>sight  of  all  men,  it  places  them  on  the  altar  of  the  sun,  and  having  done  this,  hastens  back  to  its <br/>former  abode.  The  priests  then  inspect  the  registers  of  the  dates,  and  find  that  it  has  returned  exactly <br/>as  the  five  hundredth  year  was  completed.&quot; <br/><br/>Although  admitting  that  he  had  not  seen  the  phcenix  bird  (there  being  only  one  alive  at  a  time), <br/>Herodotus  amplifies  a  bit  the  description  given  by  Clement:  &quot;They  tell  a  story  of  what  this  bird  does <br/>which  does  not  seem  to  me  to  be  credible:  that  he  comes  all  the  way  from  Arabia,  and  brings  the <br/>parent  bird,  all  plastered  with  myrrh,  to  the  temple  of  the  sun,  and  there  buries  the  body.  In  order  to <br/>bring  him,  they  say,  he  first  forms  a  ball  of  myrrh  as  big  as  he  finds  that  he  can  carry;  then  he  hollows <br/>out  the  ball,  and  puts  his  parent  inside;  after  which  he  covers  over  the  opening  with  fresh  myrrh,  and <br/>the  ball  is  then  of  exactly  the  same  weight  as  at  first;  so  he  brings  it  to  Egypt,  plastered  over  as  I  have <br/>said,  and  deposits  it  in  the  temple  of  the  sun.  Such  is  the  story  they  tell  of  the  doings  of  this  bird.&quot; <br/><br/>Both  Herodotus  and  Pliny  noted  the  general  resemblance  in  shape  between  the  phoenix  and  the  eagle, <br/>a  point  which  the  reader  should  carefully  consider,  for  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  the  modern <br/>Masonic  eagle  was  originally  a  phoenix.  The  body  of  the  phoenix  is  described  as  having  been  covered <br/>AAdth  glossy  purple  feathers,  while  its  long  tail  feathers  were  alternately  blue  and  red.  Its  head  was <br/>light  in  color  and  about  its  neck  was  a  circlet  of  golden  plumage.  At  the  back  of  its  head  the  phoenix <br/>had  a  peculiar  tuft  of  feathers,  a  fact  quite  evident,  although  it  has  been  overlooked  by  most  writers <br/>and  symbolists. <br/><br/>The  phoenix  was  regarded  as  sacred  to  the  sun,  and  the  length  of  its  life  (500  to  1000  years)  was  taken <br/>as  a  standard  for  measuring  the  motion  of  the  heavenly  bodies  and  also  the  cycles  of  time  used  in  the <br/>Mysteries  to  designate  the  periods  of  existence.  The  diet  of  the  bird  was  unknown.  Some  writers <br/>declare  that  it  subsisted  upon  the  atmosphere;  others  that  it  ate  at  rare  intervals  but  never  in  the <br/>presence  of  man.  Modern  Masons  should  realize  the  special  Masonic  significance  of  the  phoenix,  for <br/>the  bird  is  described  as  using  sprigs  of  acacia  in  the  manufacture  of  its  nest. <br/><br/>The  phoenix  (which  is  the  mythological  Persian  roc)  is  also  the  name  of  a  Southern  constellation,  and <br/>therefore  it  has  both  an  astronomical  and  an  astrological  significance.  In  all  probability,  the  phoenix <br/>was  the  swan  of  the  Greeks,  the  eagle  of  the  Romans,  and  the  peacock  of  the  Far  East.  To  the  ancient <br/>mystics  the  phoenix  was  a  most  appropriate  symbol  of  the  immortality  of  the  human  soul,  for  just  as <br/>the  phoenix  was  reborn  out  of  its  own  dead  self  seven  times  seven,  so  again  and  again  the  spiritual <br/>nature  of  man  rises  triumphant  from  his  dead  physical  body. <br/><br/>Mediaeval  Hermetists  regarded  the  phoenix  as  a  symbol  of  the  accomplishment  of  alchemical <br/>transmutation,  a  process  equivalent  to  human  regeneration.  The  name  phcenix  was  also  given  to  one <br/>of  the  secret  alchemical  formula.  The  familiar  pelican  of  the  Rose  Croix  degree,  feeding  its  young  from <br/>its  own  breast,  is  in  reality  a  phoenix,  a  fact  which  can  be  confirmed  by  an  examination  of  the  head  of <br/>the  bird.  The  ungainly  lower  part  of  the  pelican's  beak  is  entirely  missing,  the  head  of  the  phoenix <br/>being  far  more  like  that  of  an  eagle  than  of  a  pelican.  In  the  Mysteries  it  was  customary  to  refer  to <br/>initiates  as  phoenixes  or  men  who  had  been  born  again,  for  just  as  physical  birth  gives  man <br/>consciousness  in  the  physical  world,  so  the  neophyte,  after  nine  degrees  in  the  womb  of  the  Mysteries, <br/>was  born  into  a  consciousness  of  the  Spiritual  world.  This  is  the  mystery  of  initiation  to  which  Christ <br/>referred  when  he  said,  &quot;Except  a  man  be  born  again,  he  cannot  see  the  kingdom  of  God&quot;  (John  iii.  3). <br/>The  phoenix  is  a  fitting  symbol  of  this  spiritual  truth. <br/><br/>European  mysticism  was  not  dead  at  the  time  the  United  States  of  America  was  founded.  The  hand  of <br/>the  Mysteries  controlled  in  the  establishment  of  the  new  government,  for  the  signature  of  the <br/>Mysteries  may  still  be  seen  on  the  Great  Seal  of  the  United  States  of  America.  Careful  analysis  of  the <br/>seal  discloses  a  mass  of  occult  and  Masonic  symbols,  chief  among  them  the  so-called  American  eagle- <br/>-a  bird  which  Benjamin  Franklin  declared  unworthy  to  be  chosen  as  the  emblem  of  a  great,  powerful, <br/>and  progressive  people.  Here  again  only  the  student  of  symbolism  can  see  through  the  subterfuge  and <br/><br/><br/>realize  that  the  American  eagle  upon  the  Great  Seal  is  but  a  conventionalized  phoenix,  a  fact  plainly <br/>discernible  from  an  examination  of  the  original  seal.  In  his  sketch  of  The  History  of  the  Seal  of  the <br/>United  States,  Gaillard  Hunt  unwittingly  brings  forward  much  material  to  substantiate  the  belief  that <br/>the  original  seal  carried  the  Phoenix  bird  on  its  obverse  surface  and  the  Great  Pyramid  of  Gizeh  upon <br/>its  reverse  surface.  In  a  colored  sketch  submitted  as  a  design  for  the  Great  Seal  by  William  Barton  in <br/>1782,  an  actual  phoenix  appears  sitting  upon  a  nest  of  flames.  This  itself  demonstrates  a  tendenqr <br/>towards  the  use  of  this  emblematic  bird. <br/><br/><br/>PHCENIX  OR  EAGLE,  WHICH? <br/><br/>On  the  left  is  the  bird's  head  from  the  first  Great  Seal  of  the  United  States  (1782)  and  on  the  right  the  Great  Seal  of  1902. <br/>When  the  first  great  Seal  was  actually  cut,  the  bird  represented  upon  it  was  very  different  from  the  eagle  which  now <br/>appears;  the  neck  was  much  longer  and  the  tuft  of  feathers,  at  the  upper  back  part  of  the  head  was  quite  noticeable;  the <br/>beak  bore  little  resemblance  to  that  of  the  eagle;  and  the  entire  bird  was  much  thinner  and  its  wings  shorter.  It  requires <br/>very  little  imagination  to  trace  in  this  first  so-called  eagle  the  mythological  Phoenix  of  antiquity.  What  is  more,  there  is <br/>every  reason  why  a  phoenix  bird  should  be  used  to  represent  a  new  country  rising  out  of  an  old,  while  as  Benjamin <br/>Franklin  caustically  noted,  the  eagle  was  not  a  bird  of  good  moral  character! <br/><br/><br/>AN  EGYPTIAN  PHCENIX. <br/><br/><br/>From  Wilkinson's  Manners  and  Customs  of  the  Ancient  Egyptians. <br/><br/>The  Egyptians  occasionally  represented  the  Phoenix  as  having  the  body  of  a  man  and  the  wings  of  a  bird.  This  biform, <br/>creature  had  a  tuft  of  feathers  upon  its  head  and  its  arms  were  upraised  in  an  attitude  of  prayer.  As  the  phoenix  was  the <br/>symbol  of  regeneration,  the  tuft  of  feathers  on  the  back  of  its  head  might  well  symbolize  the  activity  of  the  Pineal  gland,  or <br/>third  eye,  the  occult  function  of  which  was  apparently  well  understood  by  the  ancient  priestcraft. <br/><br/><br/>THE  OBVERSE  AND  REVERSE  OF  THE  GREAT  SEAL  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA. <br/><br/><br/>From  Hunt's  History  of  the  Seal  of  the  United  States. <br/><br/><br/>The  significance  of  the  mystical  number  13,  which  frequently  appears  upon  the  Great  Seal  of  the  United  States,  is  not <br/>limited  to  the  number  of  the  original  colonies.  The  sacred  emblem  of  the  ancient  initiates,  here  composed  of  13  stars,,  also <br/>appears  above  the  head  of  the  &quot;eagle.&quot;  The  motto,  EPluribus  Unum,  contains  13  letters,  as  does  also  the  inscription, <br/>Annuit  Coeptis.  The  &quot;eagle&quot;  clutches  in  its  right  talon  a  branch  bearing  13  leaves  and  13  berries  and  in  its  left  a  sheaf  of  13 <br/>arrows.  The  face  of  the  pyramid,  exclusive  of  the  panel  containing  the  date,  consists  of  72  stones  arranged  in  13  rows. <br/><br/>p.  91 <br/><br/>If  any  one  doubts  the  presence  of  Masonic  and  occult  influences  at  the  time  the  Great  Seal  was <br/>designed,  he  should  give  due  consideration  to  the  comments  of  Professor  Charles  Eliot  Norton  of <br/>Harvard,  who  wrote  concerning  the  unfinished  pyramid  and  the  All-Seeing  Eye  which  adorned  the <br/>reverse  of  the  seal,  as  follows:  &quot;The  device  adopted  by  Congress  is  practically  incapable  of  effective <br/>treatment;  it  can  hardly  (however  artistically  treated  by  the  designer)  look  otherwise  than  as  a  dull <br/>emblem  of  a  Masonic  fraternity.&quot;  (The  History  of  the  Seal  of  the  United  States.) <br/><br/>The  eagles  of  Napoleon  and  Caesar  and  the  zodiacal  eagle  of  Scorpio  are  really  phoenixes,  for  the  latter <br/>bird&#x2014;not  the  eagle&#x2014;is  the  symbol  of  spiritual  victory  and  achievement.  Masonry  will  be  in  a  position <br/>to  solve  many  of  the  secrets  of  its  esoteric  doctrine  when  it  realizes  that  both  its  single-  and  double- <br/>headed  eagles  are  phoenixes,  and  that  to  all  initiates  and  philosophers  the  phoenix  is  the  symbol  of  the <br/>transmutation  and  regeneration  of  the  creative  energy&#x2014; commonly  called  the  accomplishment  of  the <br/>Great  Work.  The  double-headed  phoenix  is  the  prototype  of  an  androgynous  man,  for  according  to  the <br/>secret  teachings  there  will  come  a  time  when  the  human  body  will  have  two  spinal  cords,  by  means  of <br/>which  vibratory  equilibrium  will  be  maintained  in  the  body. <br/><br/>Not  only  were  many  of  the  founders  of  the  United  States  Government  Masons,  but  they  received  aid <br/>from  a  secret  and  august  body  existing  in  Europe,  which  helped  them  to  establish  this  country  for  a <br/>peculiar  and  particular  purpose  known  only  to  the  initiated  few.  The  Great  Seal  is  the  signature  of  this <br/>exalted  body&#x2014; unseen  and  for  the  most  part  unknown&#x2014; and  the  unfinished  pyramid  upon  its  reverse <br/>side  is  a  trestleboard  setting  forth  symbolically  the  task  to  the  accomplishment  of  which  the  United <br/>States  Government  was  dedicated  ftom  the  day  of  its  inception. <br/><br/>ANIMALS <br/><br/>The  lion  is  the  king  of  the  animal  family  and,  like  the  head  of  each  kingdom,  is  sacred  to  the  sun, <br/>whose  rays  are  symbolized  by  the  lion's  shaggy  mane.  The  allegories  perpetuated  by  the  Mysteries <br/>(such  as  the  one  to  the  effect  that  the  lion  opens  the  secret  book)  signify  that  the  solar  power  opens <br/>the  seed  pods,  releasing  the  spiritual  life  within.  There  was  also  a  curious  belief  among  the  ancients <br/>that  the  lion  sleeps  with  his  eyes  open,  and  for  this  reason  the  animal  was  chosen  as  a  symbol  of <br/>vigilance.  The  figure  of  a  lion  placed  on  either  side  of  doors  and  gateways  is  an  emblem  of  divine <br/>guardianship.  King  Solomon  was  often  symbolized  as  a  lion.  For  ages  the  feline  family  has  been <br/>regarded  with  peculiar  veneration.  In  several  of  the  Mysteries&#x2014; most  notably  the  Egyptian&#x2014; the  priests <br/>wore  the  skins  of  lions,  tigers,  panthers,  pumas,  or  leopards.  Hercules  and  Samson  (both  solar <br/>symbols)  slew  the  lion  of  the  constellation  of  Leo  and  robed  themselves  in  his  skin,  thus  signifying <br/>that  they  represented  the  sun  itself  when  at  the  summit  of  the  celestial  arch. <br/><br/>At  Bubastis  in  Egypt  was  the  temple  of  the  famous  goddess  Bast,  the  cat  deity  of  the  Ptolemies.  The <br/>Egyptians  paid  homage  to  the  cat,  especially  when  its  fur  was  of  three  shades  or  its  eyes  of  different <br/>colors.  To  the  priests  the  cat  was  symbolic  of  the  magnetic  forces  of  Nature,  and  they  surrounded <br/>themselves  with  these  animals  for  the  sake  of  the  astral  fire  which  emanated  from  their  bodies.  The <br/>cat  was  also  a  symbol  of  eternity,  for  when  it  sleeps  it  curls  up  into  a  ball  with  its  head  and  tail <br/>touching.  Among  the  Greeks  and  Latins  the  cat  was  sacred  to  the  goddess  Diana.  The  Buddhists  of <br/>India  invested  the  cat  with  special  significance,  but  for  a  different  reason.  The  cat  was  the  only  animal <br/>absent  at  the  death  of  the  great  Buddha,  because  it  had  stopped  on  the  way  to  chase  a  mouse.  That  the <br/>symbol  of  the  lower  astral  forces  should  not  be  present  at  the  liberation  of  the  Buddha  is  significant. <br/><br/><br/>Regarding  the  cat,  Herodotus  says:  &quot;Whenever  a  fire  breaks  out,  cats  are  agitated  with  a  kind  of  divine <br/>motion,  which  they  that  keep  them  observe,  neglecting  the  fire:  The  cats,  however,  in  spite  of  their <br/>care,  break  from  them,  leaping  even  over  the  heads  of  their  keepers  to  throw  themselves  into  the  fire. <br/>The  Egyptians  then  make  great  mourning  for  their  death.  If  a  cat  dies  a  natural  death  in  a  house,  all <br/>they  of  that  house  shave  their  eyebrows:  If  a  dog,  they  shave  the  head  and  all  the  body.  They  used  to <br/>embalm  their  dead  cats,  and  carry  them  to  Bubastis  to  be  interred  in  a  sacred  house.  (Montfaucon's <br/>Antiquities.) <br/><br/>The  most  important  of  all  symbolic  animals  was  the  Apis,  or  Egyptian  bull  of  Memphis,  which  was <br/>regarded  as  the  sacred  vehicle  for  the  transmigration  of  the  soul  of  the  god  Osiris.  It  was  declared  that <br/>the  Apis  was  conceived  by  a  bolt  of  lightning,  and  the  ceremony  attendant  upon  its  selection  and <br/>consecration  was  one  of  the  most  impressive  in  Egyptian  ritualism.  The  Apis  had  to  be  marked  in  a <br/>certain  manner.  Herodotus  states  that  the  bull  must  be  black  with  a  square  white  spot  on  his  forehead, <br/>the  form  of  an  eagle  (probably  a  vulture)  on  his  back,  a  beetle  upon  (under)  his  tongue,  and  the  hair  of <br/>his  tail  lying  two  ways.  Other  writers  declare  that  the  sacred  bull  was  marked  with  twenty-nine  sacred <br/>symbols,  his  body  was  spotted,  and  upon  his  right  side  was  a  white  mark  in  the  form  of  a  crescent. <br/>After  its  sanctification  the  Apis  was  kept  in  a  stable  adjacent  to  the  temple  and  led  in  processionals <br/>through  the  streets  of  the  city  upon  certain  solemn  occasions.  It  was  a  popular  belief  among  the <br/>Egyptians  that  any  child  upon  whom  the  bull  breathed  would  become  illustrious.  After  reaching  a <br/>certain  age  (twenty-five  years)  the  Apis  was  taken  either  to  the  river  Nile  or  to  a  sacred  fountain <br/>(authorities  differ  on  this  point)  and  drowned,  amidst  the  lamentations  of  the  populace.  The <br/>mourning  and  wailing  for  his  death  continued  until  the  new  Apis  was  found,  when  it  was  declared <br/>that  Osiris  had  reincarnated,  whereupon  rejoicing  took  the  place  of  grief. <br/><br/>The  worship  of  the  bull  was  not  confined  to  Egypt,  but  was  prevalent  in  many  nations  of  the  ancient <br/>world.  In  India,  Nandi~the  sacred  white  bull  of  Siva~is  still  the  object  of  much  veneration;  and  both <br/>the  Persians  and  the  Jews  accepted  the  bull  as  an  important  religious  symbol.  The  Assyrians, <br/>Phoenicians,  Chaldeans,  and  even  the  Greeks  reverenced  this  animal,  and  Jupiter  turned  himself  into <br/>a  white  bull  to  abduct  Europa.  The  bull  was  a  powerful  phallic  emblem  signifying  the  paternal  creative <br/>power  of  the  Demiurgus.  At  his  death  he  was  frequently  mummified  and  buried  with  the  pomp  and <br/>dignity  of  a  god  in  a  specially  prepared  sarcophagus.  Excavations  in  the  Serapeum  at  Memphis  have <br/>uncovered  the  tombs  of  more  than  sixty  of  these  sacred  animals. <br/><br/>As  the  sign  rising  over  the  horizon  at  the  vernal  equinox  constitutes  the  starry  body  for  the  annual <br/>incarnation  of  the  sun,  the  bull  not  only  was  the  celestial  symbol  of  the  Solar  Man  but,  because  the <br/>vernal  equinox  took  place  in  the  constellation  of  Taurus,  was  called  the  breaker  or  opener  of  the  year. <br/>For  this  reason  in  astronomical  symbolism  the  bull  is  often  shown  breaking  the  annular  egg  with  his <br/>horns.  The  Apis  further  signifies  that  the  God-Mind  is  incarnated  in  the  body  of  a  beast  and  therefore <br/>that  the  physical  beast  form  is  the  sacred  vehicle  of  divinity.  Man's  lower  personality  is  the  Apis  in <br/>which  Osiris  incarnates.  The  result  of  the  combination  is  the  creation  of  Sor-Apis  (Serapis)-the <br/>material  soul  as  ruler  of  the  irrational  material  body  and  involved  therein.  After  a  certain  period <br/>(which  is  determined  by  the  square  of  five,  or  twenty-five  years),  the  body  of  the  Apis  is  destroyed  and <br/>the  soul  liberated  by  the  water  which  drowns  the  material  life.  This  was  indicative  of  the  washing <br/>away  of  the  material  nature  by  the  baptismal  waters  of  divine  light  and  truth.  The  drowning  of  the <br/>Apis  is  the  symbol  of  death;  the  resurrection  of  Osiris  in  the  new  bull  is  the  symbol  of  eternal <br/>renovation.  The  white  bull  was  also  symbolically  sacred  as  the  appointed  emblem  of  the  initiates, <br/>signifying  the  spiritualized  material  bodies  of  both  man  and  Nature. <br/><br/>When  the  vernal  equinox  no  longer  occurred  in  the  sign  of  Taurus,  the  Sun  God  incarnated  in  the <br/>constellation  of  Aries  and  the  ram  then  became  the  vehicle  of  the  solar  power.  Thus  the  sun  rising  in <br/>the  sign  of  the  Celestial  Lamb  triumphs  over  the  symbolic  serpent  of  darkness.  The  lamb  is  a  familiar <br/>emblem  of  purity  because  of  its  gentleness  and  the  whiteness  of  its  wool.  In  many  of  the  pagan <br/>Mysteries  it  signified  the  Universal  Savior,  and  in  Christianity  it  is  the  favorite  symbol  of  Christ.  Early <br/><br/><br/>church  paintings  show  a  lamb  standing  upon  a  Httle  hill,  and  from  its  feet  pour  four  streams  of  living <br/>water  signifying  the  four  Gospels.  The  blood  of  the  lamb  is  the  solar  life  pouring  into  the  world <br/>through  the  sign  of  Aries. <br/><br/>The  goat  is  both  a  phallic  symbol  and  also  an  emblem  of  courage  or  aspiration  because  of  its <br/>surefootedness  and  ability  to  scale  the  loftiest  peaks.  To  the  alchemists  the  goat's  head  was  the  symbol <br/>of  sulphur.  The  practice  among  the  ancient  Jews  of  choosing  a  scapegoat  upon  which  to  heap  the  sins <br/>of  mankind  is  merely  an  allegorical <br/><br/>p.  09100 <br/><br/>From  Kircher's  Sphinx  Mystagoga. <br/><br/>THE  SACRED  BULL,  OR  APIS. <br/><br/>The  importance  of  the  bull  as  the  symbol  of  the  sun  at  the  vernal  equinox  is  discussed  in  the  chapter <br/>on  The  Zodiac  and  Its  Signs.  The  bull  and  the  ox  are  ancient  emblems  of  the  element  of  earth- <br/>consequently  of  the  planet  itself.  They  also  signify  the  animal  nature  of  man,  and  for  this  reason  were <br/>sacrificed  upon  the  altars  of  such  ancient  Mysteries  as  the  Jewish  and  Druidic.  Plutarch  wrote:  &quot;The <br/>Apis  ought  to  be  regarded  by  us,  as  a  fair  and  beautiful  image  of  the  soul  of  Osiris.&quot;  Osiris  represents <br/>the  spiritual  nature  of  the  lower  world  which  is  murdered  and  distributed  throughout  the  substance <br/>of  the  physical  spheres;  Apis  is  the  emblem  of  the  material  world  within  which  is  the  spiritual  nature- <br/>-Osiris.  The  Apis  is  also  the  symbol  of  the  exoteric  (or  profane)  doctrine,  in  contradistinction  to  the <br/>esoteric  (or  divine)  teachings  represented  by  the  urseus  worn  upon  the  foreheads  of  the  priests.  Front <br/>this  is  derived  the  mythological  allegory  of  Serapis,  who  in  a  certain  sense  is  not  only  the  composite <br/>figure  of  Osiris  and  the  lower  world  in  which  he  is  incarnated  but  also  of  the  Mysteries,  which  are  the <br/>terrestrial  bodies  containing  the  secret  teachings,  or  the  spiritual  soul. <br/><br/>p.  92 <br/><br/>depiction  of  the  Sun  Man  who  is  the  scapegoat  of  the  world  and  upon  whom  are  cast  the  sins  of  the <br/>twelve  houses  (tribes)  of  the  celestial  universe.  Truth  is  the  Divine  Lamb  worshiped  throughout <br/>pagandom  and  slain  for  the  sins  of  the  world,  and  since  the  dawn  of  time  the  Savior  Gods  of  all <br/>religions  have  been  personifications  of  this  Truth.  The  Golden  Fleece  sought  by  Jason  and  his <br/>Argonauts  is  the  Celestial  Lamb&#x2014;the  spiritual  and  intellectual  sun.  The  secret  doctrine  is  also  typified <br/>by  the  Golden  Fleece&#x2014; the  wool  of  the  Divine  Life,  the  rays  of  the  Sun  of  Truth.  Suidas  declares  the <br/>Golden  Fleece  to  have  been  in  reality  a  book,  written  upon  skin,  which  contained  the  formulae  for  the <br/>production  of  gold  by  means  of  chemistry.  The  Mysteries  were  institutions  erected  for  the <br/>transmutation  of  base  ignorance  into  precious  illumination.  The  dragon  of  ignorance  was  the  terrible <br/>creature  set  to  guard  the  Golden  Fleece,  and  represents  the  darkness  of  the  old  year  which  battles <br/>with  the  sun  at  the  time  of  its  equinoctial  passage. <br/><br/>Deer  were  sacred  in  the  Bacchic  Mysteries  of  the  Greeks;  the  Bacchantes  were  often  clothed  in <br/>fawnskins.  Deer  were  associated  with  the  worship  of  the  moon  goddess  and  the  Bacchic  orgies  were <br/>usually  conducted  at  night.  The  grace  and  speed  of  this  animal  caused  it  to  be  accepted  as  the  proper <br/>symbol  of  esthetic  abandon.  Deer  were  objects  of  veneration  with  many  nations.  In  Japan,  herds  of <br/>them  are  still  maintained  in  connection  with  the  temples. <br/><br/>The  wolf  is  usually  associated  with  the  principle  of  evil,  because  of  the  mournful  discordance  of  its <br/>howl  and  the  viciousness  of  its  nature.  In  Scandinavian  mythology  the  Fenris  Wolf  was  one  of  the <br/>sons  of  Loki,  the  infernal  god  of  the  fires.  With  the  temple  of  Asgard  in  flames  about  them,  the  gods <br/>under  the  command  of  Odin  fought  their  last  great  battle  against  the  chaotic  forces  of  evil.  With <br/>frothing  jowls  the  Fenris  Wolf  devoured  Odin,  the  Father  of  the  Gods,  and  thus  destroyed  the  Odinic <br/><br/><br/>universe.  Here  the  Fenris  Wolf  represents  those  mindless  powers  of  Nature  that  overthrew  the <br/>primitive  creation. <br/><br/>The  unicorn,  or  monoceros,  was  a  most  curious  creation  of  the  ancient  initiates.  It  is  described  by <br/>Thomas  Boreman  as  &quot;a  beast,  which  though  doubted  of  by  many  writers,  yet  is  by  others  thus <br/>described:  He  has  but  one  horn,  and  that  an  exceedingly  rich  one,  growing  out  of  the  middle  of  his <br/>forehead.  His  head  resembles  an  hart's,  his  feet  an  elephant's,  his  tail  a  boar's,  and  the  rest  of  his  body <br/>an  horse's.  The  horn  is  about  a  foot  and  half  in  length.  His  voice  is  like  the  lowing  of  an  ox.  His  mane <br/>and  hair  are  of  a  yellowish  colour.  His  horn  is  as  hard  as  iron,  and  as  rough  as  any  file,  twisted  or <br/>curled,  like  a  flaming  sword;  very  straight,  sharp,  and  everywhere  black,  excepting  the  point.  Great <br/>virtues  are  attributed  to  it,  in  expelling  of  poison  and  curing  of  several  diseases.  He  is  not  a  beast  of <br/>prey. &quot;  (See  Redgrove's  Bygone  Beliefs.) <br/><br/>While  the  unicorn  is  mentioned  several  times  in  Scripture,  no  proof  has  yet  been  discovered  of  its <br/>existence.  There  are  a  number  of  drinking  horns  in  various  museums  presumably  fashioned  from  its <br/>spike.  It  is  reasonably  certain,  however,  that  these  drinking  vessels  were  really  made  either  from  the <br/>tusks  of  some  large  mammal  or  the  horn  of  a  rhinoceros.  J.  P.  Lundy  believes  that  the  horn  of  the <br/>unicorn  symbolizes  the  hem  of  salvation  mentioned  by  St.  Luke  which,  pricking  the  hearts  of  men, <br/>turns  them  to  a  consideration  of  salvation  through  Christ.  Mediaeval  Christian  mystics  employed  the <br/>unicorn  as  an  emblem  of  Christ,  and  this  creature  must  therefore  signify  the  spiritual  life  in  man.  The <br/>single  horn  of  the  unicorn  may  represent  the  pineal  gland,  or  third  eye,  which  is  the  spiritual <br/>cognition  center  in  the  brain.  The  unicorn  was  adopted  by  the  Mysteries  as  a  symbol  of  the  illumined <br/>spiritual  nature  of  the  initiate,  the  horn  with  which  it  defends  itself  being  the  flaming  sword  of  the <br/>spiritual  doctrine  against,  which  nothing  can  prevail. <br/><br/>In  the  Book  of  Lambspring ,  a  rare  Hermetic  tract,  appears  an  engraving  showing  a  deer  and  a <br/>unicorn  standing  together  in  a  wood.  The  picture  is  accompanied  by  the  following  text:  &quot;The  Sages  say <br/>truly  that  two  animals  are  in  this  forest:  One  glorious,  beautiful,  and  swift,  a  great  and  strong  deer; <br/>the  other  an  unicorn.  *  *  *  If  we  apply  the  parable  of  our  art,  we  shall  call  the  forest  the  body.  *  *  *  The <br/>unicorn  will  be  the  spirit  at  all  times.  The  deer  desires  no  other  name  but  that  of  the  soul;  *  *  *.  He <br/>that  knows  how  to  tame  and  master  them  by  art,  to  couple  them  together,  and  to  lead  them  in  and  our <br/>of  the  form,  may  justly  be  called  a  Master.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Egyptian  devil,  Typhon,  was  often  symbolized  by  the  Set  monster  whose  identity  is  obscure.  It <br/>has  a  queer  snoutlike  nose  and  pointed  ears,  and  may  have  been  a  conventional  hyena.  The  Set <br/>monster  lived  in  the  sand  storms  and  wandered  about  the  world  promulgating  evil.  The  Egyptians <br/>related  the  howling  of  the  desert  winds  with  the  moaning  cry  of  the  hyena.  Thus  when  in  the  depths  of <br/>the  night  the  hyena  sent  forth  its  doleful  wail  it  sounded  like  the  last  despairing  cry  of  a  lost  soul  in <br/>the  clutches  of  Typhon.  Among  the  duties  of  this  evil  creature  was  that  of  protecting  the  Egyptian <br/>dead  against:  grave  robbers. <br/><br/>Among  other  symbols  of  Typhon  was  the  hippopotamus,  sacred  to  the  god  Mars  because  Mars  was <br/>enthroned  in  the  sign  of  Scorpio,  the  house  of  Typhon.  The  ass  was  also  sacred  to  this  Egyptian <br/>demon.  Jesus  riding  into  Jerusalem  upon  the  back  of  an  ass  has  the  same  significance  as  Hermes <br/>standing  upon  the  prostrate  form  of  Typhon.  The  early  Christians  were  accused  of  worshiping  the <br/>head  of  an  ass.  A  most  curious  animal  symbol  is  the  hog  or  sow,  sacred  to  Diana,  and  frequently <br/>employed  in  the  Mysteries  as  an  emblem  of  the  occult  art.  The  wild  boar  which  gored  Atys  shows  the <br/>use  of  this  animal  in  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>According  to  the  Mysteries,  the  monkey  represents  the  condition  of  man  before  the  rational  soul <br/>entered  into  his  constitution.  Therefore  it  typifies  the  irrational  man.  By  some  the  monkey  is  looked <br/><br/>upon  as  a  species  not  ensouled  by  the  spiritual  hierarchies;  by  others  as  a  fallen  state  wherein  man <br/>has  been  deprived  of  his  divine  nature  through  degeneracy.  The  ancients,  though  evolutionists,  did <br/><br/><br/>not  trace  man's  ascent  through  the  monkey;  the  monkey  they  considered  as  having  separated  itself <br/>from  the  main  stem  of  progress.  The  monkey  was  occasionally  employed  as  a  symbol  of  learning. <br/>Cynocephalus,  the  dog-headed  ape,  was  the  Egyptian  hieroglyphic  symbol  of  writing,  and  was  closely <br/>associated  with  Thoth.  Cynocephalus  is  symbolic  of  the  moon  and  Thoth  of  the  planet  Mercury. <br/>Because  of  the  ancient  belief  that  the  moon  followed  Mercury  about  the  heavens  the  dog-ape  was <br/>described  as  the  faithful  companion  of  Thoth. <br/><br/>The  dog,  because  of  its  faithfulness,  denotes  the  relationship  which  should  exist  between  disciple  and <br/>master  or  between  the  initiate  and  his  God.  The  shepherd  dog  was  a  type  of  the  priestcraft.  The  dog's <br/>ability  to  sense  and  follow  unseen  persons  for  miles  symbolized  the  transcendental  power  by  which <br/>the  philosopher  follows  the  thread  of  truth  through  the  labyrinth  of  earthly  error.  The  dog  is  also  the <br/>symbol  of  Mercury.  The  Dog  Star,  Sirius  or  Sothis,  was  sacred  to  the  Egyptians  because  it  presaged <br/>the  annual  inundations  of  the  Nile. <br/><br/>As  a  beast  of  burden  the  horse  was  the  symbol  of  the  body  of  man  forced  to  sustain  the  weight  of  his <br/>spiritual  constitution.  Conversely,  it  also  typified  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  forced  to  maintain  the <br/>burden  of  the  material  personality.  Chiron,  the  centaur,  mentor  of  Achilles,  represents  the  primitive <br/>creation  which  was  the  progenitor  and  instructor  of  mankind,  as  described  by  Berossus.  The  winged <br/>horse  and  the  magic  carpet  both  symbolize  the  secret  doctrine  and  the  spiritualized  body  of  man.  The <br/>wooden  horse  of  Troy,  secreting  an  army  for  the  capture  of  the  city,  represents  man's  body  concealing <br/>within  it  those  infinite  potentialities  which  will  later  come  forth  and  conquer  his  environment.  Again, <br/>like  Noah's  Ark,  it  represents  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  as  containing  a  host  of  latent  potentialities <br/>which  subsequently  become  active.  The  siege  of  Troy  is  a  symbolic  account  of  the  abduction  of  the <br/>human  soul  (Helena)  by  the  personality  (Paris)  and  its  final  redemption,  through  persevering  struggle, <br/>by  the  secret  doctrine&#x2014;the  Greek  army  under  the  command  of  Agamemnon. <br/><br/><br/>iENEAS  AND  THE  HARPIES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Virgil's  ^neid.  (Dryden's  translation.) <br/><br/><br/>Among  the  mythological  creatures  of  the  Mysteries  were  the  harpies&#x2014;projections  into  material  substance  of  beings <br/>existing  in  the  invisible  world  of  Nature.  They  were  described  the  Greeks  as  being  composite,  with  the  heads  of  maidens <br/>and  the  bodies  of  birds.  The  wings  of  the  harpies  were  composed  of  metal  and  their  flight  was,  accompanied  by  a  terrible <br/>clanging  noise.  During  his  wanderings,  ^neas,  the  Trojan  hero,  landed  on  the  island  of  the  harpies,  where  he  and  his <br/>followers  vainly  battled  with  these  monsters.  One  of  the  harpies  perched  upon  a  cliff  and  there  prophesied  to  i^lneid  that <br/>his  attack  upon  them  would  bring  dire  calamity  to  the  Trojans. <br/><br/><br/>P-  93 <br/><br/><br/>Flowers,  Plants,  Fruits,  and  Trees <br/><br/>THE  yoni  and  phallus  were  worshiped  by  nearly  all  ancient  peoples  as  appropriate  symbols  of  God's <br/>creative  power.  The  Garden  of  Eden,  the  Ark,  the  Gate  of  the  Temple,  the  Veil  of  the  Mysteries,  the <br/>vesica  piscis  or  oval  nimbus,  and  the  Holy  Grail  are  important  yonic  symbols;  the  pyramid,  the <br/>obelisk,  the  cone,  the  candle,  the  tower,  the  Celtic  monolith,  the  spire,  the  campanile,  the  Maypole, <br/>and  the  Sacred  Spear  are  symbolic  of  the  phallus.  In  treating  the  subject  of  Priapic  worship,  too  many <br/>modern  authors  judge  pagan  standards  by  their  own  and  wallow  in  the  mire  of  self-created  vulgarity. <br/>The  Eleusinian  Mysteries&#x2014;the  greatest  of  all  the  ancient  secret  societies&#x2014;established  one  of  the <br/>highest  known  standards  of  morality  and  ethics,  and  those  criticizing  their  use  of  phallic  symbols <br/>should  ponder  the  trenchant  words  of  King  Edward  HI,  &quot;Honi  soit  qui  malypense.&quot; <br/><br/>The  obscene  rites  practiced  by  the  later  Bacchanalia  and  Dionysia  were  no  more  representative  of  the <br/>standards  of  purity  originally  upheld  by  the  Mysteries  than  the  orgies  occasionally  occurring  among <br/>the  adherents  of  Christianity  till  the  eighteenth  century  were  representative  of  primitive  Christianity. <br/>Sir  William  Hamilton,  British  Minister  at  the  Court  of  Naples,  declares  that  in  1780,  Isernia,  a <br/>community  of  Christians  in  Italy,  worshiped  with  phallic  ceremonies  the  pagan  god  Priapus  under  the <br/>name  of  St.  Cosmo.  (See  Two  Essays  on  the  Worship  of  Priapus,  by  Richard  Payne  Knight.) <br/><br/>Father,  mother,  and  child  constitute  the  natural  trinity.  The  Mysteries  glorified  the  home  as  the <br/>supreme  institution  consisting  of  this  trinity  functioning  as  a  unit.  Pythagoras  likened  the  universe  to <br/>the  family,  declaring  that  as  the  supreme  fire  of  the  universe  was  in  the  midst  of  its  heavenly  bodies, <br/>so,  by  analogy,  the  supreme  fire  of  the  world  was  upon  its  hearthstones.  The  Pythagorean  and  other <br/>schools  of  philosophy  conceived  the  one  divine  nature  of  God  to  manifest  itself  in  the  threefold  aspect <br/>of  Father,  Mother,  and  Child.  These  three  constituted  the  Divine  Family,  whose  dwelling  place  is <br/>creation  and  whose  natural  and  peculiar  symbol  is  the  47th  problem  of  Euclid.  God  the  Father  is <br/>spirit,  God  the  Mother  is  matter,  and  God  the  Child&#x2014; the  product  of  the  two&#x2014; represents  the  sum  of <br/>living  things  born  out  of  and  constituting  Nature.  The  seed  of  spirit  is  sown  in  the  womb  of  matter, <br/>and  by  an  immaculate  (pure)  conception  the  progeny  is  brought  into  being.  Is  not  this  the  true <br/>mystery  of  the  Madonna  holding  the  Holy  Babe  in  her  arms?  Who  dares  to  say  that  such  symbolism  is <br/>improper?  The  mystery  of  life  is  the  supreme  mystery,  revealed  in  all  of  its  divine  dignity  and  glorified <br/>as  Nature's  per  feet  achievement  by  the  initiated  sages  and  seers  of  all  ages. <br/><br/>The  prudery  of  today,  however,  declares  this  same  mystery  to  be  unfit  for  the  consideration  of  holy- <br/>minded  people.  Contrary  to  the  dictates  of  reason,  a  standard  has  been  established  which  affirms  that <br/>innocence  bred  of  ignorance  is  more  to  be  desired  than  virtue  born  of  knowledge.  Eventually, <br/>however,  man  will  learn  that  he  need  never  be  ashamed  of  truth.  Until  he  does  learn  this,  he  is  false  to <br/>his  God,  to  his  world,  and  to  himself.  In  this  respect,  Christianity  has  woefully  failed  in  its  mission. <br/>While  declaring  man's  body  to  be  the  living  temple  of  the  living  God,  in  the  same  breath  it  asserts  the <br/>substances  and  functions  of  this  temple  to  be  unclean  and  their  study  defiling  to  the  sensitive <br/>sentiments  of  the  righteous.  By  this  unwholesome  attitude,  man's  body&#x2014; the  house  of  God&#x2014; is <br/>degraded  and  defamed.  Yet  the  cross  itself  is  the  oldest  of  phallic  emblems,  and  the  lozenge-shaped <br/>windows  of  cathedrals  are  proof  that  yonic  symbols  have  survived  the  destruction  of  the  pagan <br/>Mysteries.  The  very  structure  of  the  church  itself  is  permeated  with  phallicism.  Remove  from  the <br/>Christian  Church  all  emblems  of  Priapic  origin  and  nothing  is  left,  for  even  the  earth  upon  which  it <br/>stands  was,  because  of  its  fertility,  the  first  yonic  symbol.  As  the  presence  of  these  emblems  of  the <br/>generative  processes  is  either  unknown  or  unheeded  by  the  majority,  the  irony  of  the  situation  is  not <br/>generally  appreciated.  Only  those  conversant  with  the  secret  language  of  antiquity  are  capable  of <br/>understanding  the  divine  significance  of  these  emblems. <br/><br/><br/>Flowers  were  chosen  as  symbols  for  many  reasons.  The  great  variety  of  flora  made  it  possible  to  find <br/>some  plant  or  flower  which  would  be  a  suitable  figure  for  nearly  any  abstract  quality  or  condition.  A <br/>plant  might  be  chosen  because  of  some  myth  connected  with  its  origin,  as  the  stories  of  Daphne  and <br/>Narcissus;  because  of  the  peculiar  environment  in  which  it  thrived,  as  the  orchid  and  the  fungus; <br/>because  of  its  significant  shape,  as  the  passion  flower  and  the  Easter  lily;  because  of  its  brilliance  or <br/>fragrance,  as  the  verbena  and  the  sweet  lavender;  because  it  preserved  its  form  indefinitely,  as  the <br/>everlasting  flower;  because  of  unusual  characteristics  as  the  sunflower  and  heliotrope,  which  have <br/>long  been  sacred  because  of  their  affinity  for  the  sun. <br/><br/>The  plant  might  also  be  considered  worthy  of  veneration  because  from  its  crushed  leaves,  petals, <br/>stalks,  or  roots  could  be  extracted  healing  unctions,  essences,  or  drugs  affecting  the  nature  and <br/>intelligence  of  human  beings&#x2014;such  as  the  poppy  and  the  ancient  herbs  of  prophecy.  The  plant  might <br/>also  be  regarded  as  efficacious  in  the  cure  of  many  diseases  because  its  fruit,  leaves,  petals,  or  roots <br/>bore  a  resemblance  in  shape  or  color  to  parts  or  organs  of  the  human  body.  For  example,  the  distilled <br/>juices  of  certain  species  of  ferns,  also  the  hairy  moss  growing  upon  oaks,  and  the  thistledown  were <br/>said  to  have  the  power  of  growing  hair;  the  dentaria,  which  resembles  a  tooth  in  shape,  was  said  to <br/>cure  the  toothache;  and  the  palma  Christi  plant,  because  of  its  shape,  cured  all  afflictions  of  the  hands. <br/><br/>The  blossom  is  really  the  reproductive  system  of  the  plant  and  is  therefore  singularly  appropriate  as  a <br/>symbol  of  sexual  purity&#x2014;an  absolute  requisite  of  the  ancient  Mysteries.  Thus  the  flower  signifies  this <br/>ideal  of  beauty  and  regeneration  which  must  ultimately  take  the  place  of  lust  and  degeneracy. <br/><br/>Of  all  symbolic  flowers  the  locus  blossom  of  India  and  Egypt  and  the  rose  of  the  Rosicrucians  are  the <br/>most  important.  In  their  symbolism  these  two  flowers  are  considered  identical.  The  esoteric  doctrines <br/>for  which  the  Eastern  lotus  stands  have  been  perpetuated  in  modern  Europe  under  the  form  of  the <br/>rose.  The  rose  and  the  lotus  are  yonic  emblems,  signifying  primarily  the  maternal  creative  mystery, <br/>while  the  Easter  lily  is  considered  to  be  phallic. <br/><br/>The  Brahmin  and  Egyptian  initiates,  who  undoubtedly  understood  the  secret  systems  of  spiritual <br/>culture  whereby  the  latent  centers  of  cosmic  energy  in  man  may  be  stimulated,  employed  the  lotus <br/>blossoms  to  represent  the  spinning  vortices  of  spiritual  energy  located  at  various  points  along  the <br/>spinal  column  and  called  chakras,  or  whirling  wheels,  by  the  Hindus.  Seven  of  these  chakras  are  of <br/>prime  importance  and  have  their  individual  correspondences  in  the  nerve  ganglia  and  plexuses. <br/>According  to  the  secret  schools,  the  sacral  ganglion  is  called  the  four-petaled  lotus;  the  prostatic <br/>plexus,  the  six-petaled  lotus;  the  epigastric  plexus  and  navel,  the  ten-petaled  lotus;  the  cardiac  plexus, <br/>the  twelve-petaled  lotus;  the  pharyngeal  plexus,  the  sixteen-petaled  locus;  the  cavernous  plexus,  the <br/>two-petaled  lotus;  and  the  pineal  gland  or  adjacent  unknown  center,  the  thousand-petaled  locus.  The <br/>color,  size,  and  number  of  petals  upon  the <br/><br/><br/>THE  TREE  OF  THE  KNIGHTS  OF  THE  ROUND  TABLE. <br/><br/><br/>This  remarkable  example  of  the  use  of  the  tree  in  symbolism  is  from  the  Chateau  de  Pierrefonds  in  the  little  town  of <br/>Pierrefonds,  northern  France.  The  eight  side  branches  end  in  conventional  cup-like  flowers,  from  each  of  which  rises  the <br/>body  of  a  knight  carrying  in  his  hand  a  ribbon  bearing  his  name.  The  central  stem  is  surmounted  by  a  larger  flower,  from <br/>which  emerges  the  body  of  King  Arthur  himself.  The  tree  is  a  favorite  motif  in  heraldry.  The  one  trunk  with  its  multitude <br/>of  branches  caused  the  tree  to  be  frequently  used  in  diagramming  family  lineage,  from  which  practice  has  arisen  the <br/>custom  of  terming  such  tables  &quot;family  trees.&quot; <br/><br/>p-  94 <br/><br/>lotus  are  the  keys  to  its  symbolic  import.  A  hint  concerning  the  unfoldment  of  spiritual  understanding <br/>according  to  the  secret  science  of  the  Mysteries  is  found  in  the  story  of  Aaron's  rod  that  budded,  and <br/>also  in  Wagner's  great  opera,  Tannhduser,  where  the  budding  staff  of  the  Pope  signifies  the  unfolding <br/>blossoms  upon  the  sacred  rod  of  the  Mysteries&#x2014;the  spinal  column. <br/><br/><br/>The  Rosicnicians  used  a  garland  of  roses  to  signify  the  same  spiritual  vortices,  which  are  referred  to <br/>in  the  Bible  as  the  seven  lamps  of  the  candlestick  and  the  seven  churches  of  Asia.  In  the  1642  edition <br/>of  Sir  Francis  Bacon's  History  of  Henry  the  Seventh  is  a  frontispiece  showing  Lord  Bacon  with <br/>Rosicrucian  roses  for  shoe  buckles. <br/><br/>In  the  Hindu  system  of  philosophy,  each  petal  of  the  lotus  bears  a  certain  symbol  which  gives  an <br/>added  clue  to  the  meaning  of  the  flower.  The  Orientals  also  used  the  lotus  plant  to  signify  the  growth <br/>of  man  through  the  three  periods  of  human  consciousness&#x2014;ignorance,  endeavor,  and  understanding. <br/>As  the  lotus  exists  in  three  elements  (earth,  water,  and  air)  so  man  lives  in  three  worlds&#x2014;material, <br/>intellectual,  and  spiritual.  As  the  plant,  with  its  roots  in  the  mud  and  the  slime,  grows  upward <br/>through  the  water  and  finally  blossoms  forth  in  the  light  and  air,  so  the  spiritual  growth  of  man  is <br/>upward  from  the  darkness  of  base  action  and  desire  into  the  light  of  truth  and  understanding,  the <br/>water  serving  as  a  symbol  of  the  ever-changing  world  of  illusion  through  which  the  soul  must  pass  in <br/>its  struggle  to  reach  the  state  of  spiritual  illumination.  The  rose  and  its  Eastern  equivalent,  the  lotus, <br/>like  all  beautiful  flowers,  represent  spiritual  unfoldment  and  attainment:  hence,  the  Eastern  deities <br/>are  often  shown  seated  upon  the  open  petals  of  the  lotus  blossoms. <br/><br/>The  lotus  was  also  a  universal  motif  in  Egyptian  art  and  architecture.  The  roofs  of  many  temples  were <br/>upheld  by  lotus  columns,  signifying  the  eternal  wisdom;  and  the  lotus-headed  scepter&#x2014; symbolic  of <br/>self -unfoldment  and  divine  prerogative&#x2014; was  often  carried  in  religious  processions.  When  the  flower <br/>had  nine  petals,  it  was  symbolic  of  man;  when  twelve,  of  the  universe  and  the  gods;  when  seven,  of <br/>the  planets  and  the  law;  when  five,  of  the  senses  and  the  Mysteries;  and  when  three,  of  the  chief <br/>deities  and  the  worlds.  The  heraldic  rose  of  the  Middle  Ages  generally  has  either  five  or  ten  petals <br/>thereby  showing  its  relationship  to  the  spiritual  mystery  of  man  through  the  Pythagorean  pentad  and <br/>decad. <br/><br/>CULTUS  ARBORUM <br/><br/>The  worship  of  trees  as  proxies  of  Divinity  was  prevalent  throughout  the  ancient  world.  Temples  were <br/>often  built  in  the  heart  of  sacred  groves,  and  nocturnal  ceremonials  were  conducted  under  the  wide- <br/>spreading  branches  of  great  trees,  fantastically  decorated  and  festooned  in  honor  of  their  patron <br/>deities.  In  many  instances  the  trees  themselves  were  believed  to  possess  the  attributes  of  divine  power <br/>and  intelligence,  and  therefore  supplications  were  often  addressed  to  them.  The  beauty,  dignity, <br/>massiveness,  and  strength  of  oaks,  elms,  and  cedars  led  to  their  adoption  as  symbols  of  power, <br/>integrity,  permanence,  virility,  and  divine  protection. <br/><br/>Several  ancient  peoples&#x2014; notably  the  Hindus  and  Scandinavians &#x2014; regarded  the  Macrocosm,  or  Grand <br/>Universe,  as  a  divine  tree  growing  from  a  single  seed  sown  in  space.  The  Greeks,  Persians,  Chaldeans, <br/>and  Japanese  have  legends  describing  the  axle  tree  or  reed  upon  which  the  earth  revolves.  Kapila <br/>declares  the  universe  to  be  the  eternal  tree,  Brahma,  which  springs  from  an  imperceptible  and <br/>intangible  seed&#x2014; the  material  monad.  The  mediseval  Qabbalists  represented  creation  as  a  tree  with  its <br/>roots  in  the  reality  of  spirit  and  its  branches  in  the  illusion  of  tangible  existence.  The  Sephirothic  tree <br/>of  the  Qabbalah  was  therefore  inverted,  with  its  roots  in  heaven  and  its  branches  upon  the  earth. <br/>Madam  Blavatsky  notes  that  the  Great  Pyramid  was  considered  to  be  a  symbol  of  this  inverted  tree, <br/>with  its  root  at  the  apex  of  the  pyramid  and  its  branches  diverging  in  four  streams  towards  the  base. <br/><br/>The  Scandinavian  world-tree,  Yggdrasil,  supports  on  its  branches  nine  spheres  or  worlds,&#x2014; which  the <br/>Egyptians  symbolized  by  the  nine  stamens  of  the  persea  or  avocado.  All  of  these  are  enclosed  within <br/>the  mysterious  tenth  sphere  or  cosmic  egg&#x2014; the  definitionless  Cipher  of  the  Mysteries.  The  Qabbalistic <br/>tree  of  the  Jews  also  consists  of  nine  branches,  or  worlds,  emanating  from  the  First  Cause  or  Crown, <br/>which  surrounds  its  emanations  as  the  shell  surrounds  the  egg.  The  single  source  of  life  and  the <br/>endless  diversity  of  its  expression  has  a  perfect  analogy  in  the  structure  of  the  tree.  The  trunk <br/>represents  the  single  origin  of  all  diversity;  the  roots,  deeply  imbedded  in  the  dark  earth,  are  symbolic <br/><br/><br/>of  divine  nutriment;  and  its  multiplicity  of  branches  spreading  from  the  central  trunk  represent  the <br/>infinity  of  universal  effects  dependent  upon  a  single  cause. <br/><br/>The  tree  has  also  been  accepted  as  symbolic  of  the  Microcosm,  that  is,  man.  According  to  the  esoteric <br/>doctrine,  man  first  exists  potentially  within  the  body  of  the  world-tree  and  later  blossoms  forth  into <br/>objective  manifestation  upon  its  branches.  According  to  an  early  Greek  Mystery  myth,  the  god  Zeus <br/>fabricated  the  third  race  of  men  from  ash  trees.  The  serpent  so  often  shown  wound  around  the  trunk <br/>of  the  tree  usually  signifies  the  mind&#x2014;the  power  of  thought&#x2014;and  is  the  eternal  tempter  or  urge  which <br/>leads  all  rational  creatures  to  the  ultimate  discovery  of  reality  and  thus  overthrows  the  rule  of  the <br/>gods.  The  serpent  hidden  in  the  foliage  of  the  universal  tree  represents  the  cosmic  mind;  and  in  the <br/>human  tree,  the  individualized  intellect. <br/><br/>The  concept  that  all  life  originates  from  seeds  caused  grain  and  various  plants  to  be  accepted  as <br/>emblematic  of  the  human  spermatozoon,  and  the  tree  was  therefore  symbolic  of  organized  life <br/>unfolding  from  its  primitive  germ.  The  growth  of  the  universe  from  its  primitive  seed  may  be  likened <br/>to  the  growth  of  the  mighty  oak  from  the  tiny  acorn.  While  the  tree  is  apparently  much  greater  than <br/>its  own  source,  nevertheless  that  source  contains  potentially  every  branch,  twig,  and  leaf  which  will <br/>later  be  objectively  unfolded  by  the  processes  of  growth. <br/><br/>Man's  veneration  for  trees  as  symbols  of  the  abstract  qualities  of  wisdom  and  integrity  also  led  him  to <br/>designate  as  trees  those  individuals  who  possessed  these  divine  qualities  to  an  apparently <br/>superhuman  degree.  Highly  illumined  philosophers  and  priests  were  therefore  often  referred  to  as <br/>trees  or  tree  men&#x2014; for  example,  the  Druids,  whose  name,  according  to  one  interpretation,  signifies  the <br/>men  of  the  oak  trees,  or  the  initiates  of  certain  Syrian  Mysteries  who  were  called  cedars;  in  fact  it  is <br/>far  more  credible  and  probable  that  the  famous  cedars  of  Lebanon,  cut  down  for  the  building  of  King <br/>Solomon's  Temple,  were  really  illumined,  initiated  sages.  The  mystic  knows  that  the  true  supports  of <br/>God's  Glorious  House  were  not  the  logs  subject  to  decay  but  the  immortal  and  imperishable  intellects <br/>of  the  tree  hierophants. <br/><br/>Trees  are  repeatedly  mentioned  in  the  Old  and  New  Testaments,  and  in  the  scriptures  of  various <br/>pagan  nations.  The  Tree  of  Life  and  the  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  mentioned  in  Genesis, <br/>the  burning  bush  in  which  the  angel  appeared  to  Moses,  the  famous  vine  and  fig  tree  of  the  New <br/>Testament,  the  grove  of  olives  in  the  Garden  of  Gethsemane  where  Jesus  went  to  pray,  and  the <br/>miraculous  tree  of  Revelation,  which  bore  twelve  manners  of  fruit  and  whose  leaves  were  for  the <br/>healing  of  the  nations,  all  bear  witness  to  the  esteem  in  which  trees  were  held  by  the  scribes  of  Holy <br/>Writ.  Buddha  received  his  illumination  while  under  the  bodhi  tree,  near  Madras  in  India,  and  several <br/>of  the  Eastern  gods  are  pictured  sitting  in  meditation  beneath  the  spreading  branches  of  mighty  trees. <br/>Many  of  the  great  sages  and  saviors  carried  wands,  rods,  or  staves  cut  from  the  wood  of  sacred  trees, <br/>as  the  rods  of  Moses  and  Aaron;  Gungnir&#x2014; the  spear  of  Odin&#x2014; cut  from  the  Tree  of  Life;  and  the <br/>consecrated  rod  of  Hermes,  around  which  the  fighting  serpents  entwined  themselves. <br/><br/>The  numerous  uses  which  the  ancients  made  of  the  tree  and  its  products  are  factors  in  its  symbolism. <br/>Its  worship  was,  to  a  certain  degree,  based  upon  its  usefulness.  Of  this  J.  P.  Lundy  writes:  &quot;Trees <br/>occupy  such  an  important  place  in  the  economy  of  nature  by  way  of  attracting  and  retaining  moisture, <br/>and  shading  the  water-sources  and  the  soil  so  as  to  prevent  barrenness  and  desolation;  the),  are  so <br/><br/><br/>THE  TREE  OF  NOAH. <br/><br/><br/>From  the  &quot;Breeches&quot;  Bible  0/1599. <br/><br/>Most  Bibles  published  during  the  Middle  Ages  contain  a  section  devoted  to  genealogical  tables  showing  the  descent  of <br/>humanity  from  Father  Adam  to  the  advent  of  Jesus  Christ.  The  tree  growing  from  the  roof  of  the  Ark  represents  the  body <br/>of  Noah  and  its  three  branches,  his  sons&#x2014;Shem,  Ham,  and  Japheth.  The  nations  by  the  descendents  of  Noah's  three  sons <br/>are  appropriately  shown  in  the  circles  upon  the  branches  of  the  tree.  While  such  tables  are  hopelessly  incorrect  from  a <br/>historical  point  of  view,  to  the  symbolist  their  allegorical  interpretations  are  of  inestimable  importance. <br/><br/>p-  95 <br/><br/>useful  to  man  for  shade,  for  fruit,  for  medicine,  for  fuel,  for  building  houses  and  ships,  for  furniture, <br/>for  almost  every  department  of  life,  that  it  is  no  wonder  that  some  of  the  more  conspicuous  ones,  such <br/>as  the  oak,  the  pine,  the  palm,  and  the  sycamore,  have  been  made  sacred  and  used  for  worship.&quot;  (See <br/>Monumental  Christianity.) <br/><br/>The  early  Fathers  of  the  church  sometimes  used  the  tree  to  symbolize  Christ.  They  believed  that <br/>ultimately  Christianity  would  grow  up  like  a  mighty  oak  and  overshadow  all  other  faiths  of  mankind. <br/>Because  it  annually  discards  its  foliage,  the  tree  was  also  looked  upon  as  an  appropriate  emblem  of <br/>resurrection  and  reincarnation,  for  though  apparently  dying  each  fall  it  blossomed  forth  again  with <br/>renewed  verdure  each  ensuing  spring. <br/><br/><br/>Under  the  appellations  of  the  Tree  of  Life  and  the  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  is <br/>concealed  the  great  arcanum  of  antiquity&#x2014;the  mystery  of  equilibrium.  The  Tree  of  Life  represents  the <br/>spiritual  point  of  balance&#x2014;the  secret  of  immortality.  The  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil,  as <br/>its  name  implies,  represents  polarity,  or  unbalance&#x2014; the  secret  of  mortality.  The  Qabbalists  reveal  this <br/>by  assigning  the  central  column  of  their  Sephirothic  diagram  to  the  Tree  of  Life  and  the  two  side <br/>branches  to  the  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil.  &quot;Unbalanced  forces  perish  in  the  void,&quot; <br/>declares  the  secret  work,  and  all  is  made  known.  The  apple  represents  the  knowledge  of  the <br/>procreative  processes,  by  the  awakening  of  which  the  material  universe  was  established.  The  allegory <br/>of  Adam  and  Eve  in  the  Garden  of  Eden  is  a  cosmic  myth,  revealing  the  methods  of  universal  and <br/>individual  establishment.  The  literal  story,  accepted  for  so  many  centuries  by  an  unthinking  world,  is <br/>preposterous,  but  the  creative  mystery  of  which  it  is  the  symbol  is  one  of  Nature's  profoundest  verities. <br/>The  Ophites  (serpent  worshipers)  revered  the  Edenic  snake  because  it  was  the  cause  of  individual <br/>existence.  Though  humanity  is  still  wandering  in  a  world  of  good  and  evil,  it  will  ultimately  attain <br/>completion  and  eat  of  the  fruit  of  the  Tree  of  Life  growing  in  the  midst  of  the  illusionary  garden  of <br/>worldly  things.  Thus  the  Tree  of  Life  is  also  the  appointed  symbol  of  the  Mysteries,  and  by  partaking <br/>of  its  fruit  man  attains  immortality. <br/><br/>The  oak,  the  pine,  the  ash,  the  cypress,  and  the  palm  are  the  five  trees  of  greatest  symbolic <br/>importance.  The  Father  God  of  the  Mysteries  was  often  worshiped  under  the  form  of  an  oak;  the <br/>Savior  God&#x2014; frequently  the  World  Martyr&#x2014; in  the  form  of  a  pine;  the  world  axis  and  the  divine  nature <br/>in  humanity  in  the  form  of  an  ash;  the  goddesses,  or  maternal  principle,  in  the  form  of  a  cypress;  and <br/>the  positive  pole  of  generation  in  the  form  of  the  inflorescence  of  the  mate  date  palm.  The  pine  cone  is <br/>a  phallic  symbol  of  remote  antiquity.  The  thyrsus  of  Bacchus&#x2014; a  long  wand  or  staff  surmounted  by  a <br/>pine  cone  or  cluster  of  grapes  and  entwined  with  ivy  or  grape-vine  leaves,  sometimes  ribbons- <br/>signifies  that  the  wonders  of  Nature  may  only  be  accomplished  by  the  aid  of  solar  virility,  as <br/>symbolized  by  the  cone  or  grapes.  In  the  Phrygian  Mysteries,  Atys&#x2014; the  ever-present  sun-savior&#x2014; dies <br/>under  the  branches  of  the  pine  tree  (an  allusion  to  the  solar  globe  at  the  winter  solstice)  and  for  this <br/>reason  the  pine  tree  was  sacred  to  his  cult.  This  tree  was  also  sacred  in  the  Mysteries  of  Dionysos  and <br/>Apollo. <br/><br/>Among  the  ancient  Egyptians  and  Jews  the  acacia,  or  tamarisk,  was  held  in  the  highest  religious <br/>esteem;  and  among  modern  Masons,  branches  of  acacia,  cypress,  cedar,  or  evergreen  are  still <br/>regarded  as  most  significant  emblems.  The  shittim-wood  used  by  the  children  of  Israel  in  the <br/>construction  of  the  Tabernacle  and  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  was  a  species  of  acacia.  In  describing  this <br/>sacred  tree,  Albert  Pike  has  written:  &quot;The  genuine  acacia,  also,  is  the  thorny  tamarisk,  the  same  tree <br/>which  grew  around  the  body  of  Osiris.  It  was  a  sacred  tree  among  the  Arabs,  who  made  of  it  the  idol <br/>Al-Uzza,  which  Mohammed  destroyed.  It  is  abundant  as  a  bush  in  the  desert  of  Thur;  and  of  it  the <br/>'crown  of  thorns'  was  composed,  which  was  set  on  the  forehead  of  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  It  is  a  fit  type  of <br/>immortality  on  account  of  its  tenacity  of  life;  for  it  has  been  known,  when  planted  as  a  door-post,  to <br/>take  root  again  and  shoot  out  budding  boughs  above  the  threshold.&quot;  (See  Morals  and  Dogma.) <br/><br/>It  is  quite  possible  that  much  of  the  veneration  accorded  the  acacia  is  due  to  the  peculiar  attributes  of <br/>the  mimosa,  or  sensitive  plant,  with  which  it  was  often  identified  by  the  ancients.  There  is  a  Coptic <br/>legend  to  the  effect  that  the  sensitive  plant  was  the  first  of  all  trees  or  shrubs  to  worship  Christ.  The <br/>rapid  growth  of  the  acacia  and  its  beauty  have  also  caused  it  to  be  regarded  as  emblematic  of <br/>fecundity  and  generation. <br/><br/>The  symbolism  of  the  acacia  is  susceptible  of  four  distinct  interpretations:  (i)  it  is  the  emblem  of  the <br/>vernal  equinox&#x2014; the  annual  resurrection  of  the  solar  deity;  (2)  under  the  form  of  the  sensitive  plant <br/>which  shrinks  from  human  touch,  the  acacia  signifies  purity  and  innocence,  as  one  of  the  Greek <br/>meanings  of  its  name  implies;  (3)  it  fittingly  typifies  human  immortality  and  regeneration,  and  under <br/>the  form  of  the  evergreen  represents  that  immortal  part  of  man  which  survives  the  destruction  of  his <br/>visible  nature;  (4)  it  is  the  ancient  and  revered  emblem  of  the  Mysteries,  and  candidates  entering  the <br/><br/><br/>tortuous  passageways  in  which  the  ceremonials  were  given  carried  in  their  hands  branches  of  these <br/>sacred  plants  or  small  clusters  of  sanctified  flowers. <br/><br/>Albert  G.  Mackey  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  each  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  had  its  own  peculiar <br/>plant  sacred  to  the  gods  or  goddesses  in  whose  honor  the  rituals  were  celebrated.  These  sacred  plants <br/>were  later  adopted  as  the  symbols  of  the  various  degrees  in  which  they  were  used.  Thus,  in  the <br/>Mysteries  of  Adonis,  lettuce  was  sacred;  in  the  Brahmin  and  Egyptian  rites,  the  lotus;  among  the <br/>Druids,  the  mistletoe;  and  among  certain  of  the  Greek  Mysteries,  the  myrtle.  (See  Encyclopaedia  of <br/>Freemasonry.) <br/><br/>As  the  legend  of  CHiram  Abiff  is  based  upon  the  ancient  Egyptian  Mystery  ritual  of  the  murder  and <br/>resurrection  of  Osiris,  it  is  natural  that  the  sprig  of  acacia  should  be  preserved  as  symbolic  of  the <br/>resurrection  of  CHiram.  The  chest  containing  the  body  of  Osiris  was  washed  ashore  near  Byblos  and <br/>lodged  in  the  roots  of  a  tamarisk,  or  acacia,  which,  growing  into  a  mighty  tree,  enclosed  within  its <br/>trunk  the  body  of  the  murdered  god.  This  is  undoubtedly  the  origin  of  the  story  that  a  sprig  of  acacia <br/>marks  the  grave  of  CHiram.  The  mystery  of  the  evergreen  marking  the  grave  of  the  dead  sun  god  is <br/>also  perpetuated  in  the  Christmas  tree. <br/><br/>The  apricot  and  quince  are  familiar  yonic  symbols,  while  the  bunch  of  grapes  and  the  fig  are  phallic. <br/>The  pomegranate  is  the  mystic  fruit  of  the  Eleusinian  rites;  by  eating  it,  Prosperine  bound  herself  to <br/>the  realms  of  Pluto.  The  fruit  here  signifies  the  sensuous  life  which,  once  tasted,  temporarily  deprives <br/>man  of  immortality.  Also  on  account  of  its  vast  number  of  seeds  the  pomegranate  was  often  employed <br/>to  represent  natural  fecundity.  For  the  same  reason,  Jacob  Bryant  in  his  Ancient  My  thology  notes <br/>that  the  ancients  recognized  in  this  fruit  an  appropriate  emblem  of  the  Ark  of  the  Deluge, <br/><br/><br/>THE  SUNFLOWER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  Magnes  sive  deArte  Magnetica  Opus  Tripartitum. <br/><br/>The  above  diagram  illustrates  a  curious  experiment  in  plant  magnetism  reproduced  with  several  other  experiments  in <br/>Athanasius  Kircher's  rare  volume  on  magnetism.  Several  plants  were  sacred  to  the  ancient  Egyptians,  Greeks,  and  Hindus <br/>because  of  the  peculiar  effect  which  the  sun  exerted  over  them.  As  it  is  difficult  for  man  to  look  upon  the  face  of  the  sun <br/><br/><br/>without  being  blinded  by  the  hght,  those  plants  which  turned  and  deliberately  faced  the  solar  orb  were  considered  typical <br/>of  very  highly  advanced  souls.  Since  the  sun  was  regarded  as  the  personification  of  the  Supreme  Deity,  those  forms  of  life <br/>over  which  it  exercised  marked  influence  were  venerated  as  being  sacred  to  Divinity.  The  sunflower,  because  of  its  plainly <br/>perceptible  affinity  for  the  sun,  was  given  high  rank  among  sacred  plants. <br/><br/>p.  96 <br/><br/>which  contained  the  seeds  of  the  new  human  race.  Among  the  ancient  Mysteries  the  pomegranate  was <br/>also  considered  to  be  a  divine  symbol  of  such  peculiar  significance  that  its  true  explanation  could  not <br/>be  divulged.  It  was  termed  by  the  Cabiri  &quot;the  forbidden  secret.&quot;  Many  Greek  gods  and  goddesses  are <br/>depicted  holding  the  fruit  or  flower  of  the  pomegranate  in  their  hands,  evidently  to  signify  that  they <br/>are  givers  of  life  and  plenty.  Pomegranate  capitals  were  placed  upon  the  pillars  of  Jachin  and  Boaz <br/>standing  in  front  of  King  Solomon's  Temple;  and  by  the  order  of  Jehovah,  pomegranate  blossoms <br/>were  embroidered  upon  the  bottom  of  the  High  Priest's  ephod. <br/><br/>Strong  wine  made  from  the  juice  of  the  grape  was  looked  upon  as  symbolic  of  the  false  life  and  false <br/>light  of  the  universe,  for  it  was  produced  by  a  false  process&#x2014;artificial  fermentation.  The  rational <br/>faculties  are  clouded  by  strong  drink,  and  the  animal  nature,  liberated  from  bondage,  controls  the <br/>individual&#x2014;facts  which  necessarily  were  of  the  greatest  spiritual  significance.  As  the  lower  nature  is <br/>the  eternal  tempter  seeking  co  lead  man  into  excesses  which  inhibit  the  spiritual  faculties,  the  grape <br/>and  its  product  were  used  to  symbolize  the  Adversary. <br/><br/>The  juice  of  the  grape  was  thought  by  the  Egyptians  to  resemble  human  blood  more  closely  than  did <br/>any  other  substance.  In  fact,  they  believed  that  the  grape  secured  its  life  from  the  blood  of  the  dead <br/>who  had  been  buried  in  the  earth.  According  to  Plutarch,  &quot;The  priests  of  the  sun  at  Heliopolis  never <br/>carry  any  wine  into  their  temples,  *  *  *  and  if  they  made  use  of  it  at  any  time  in  their  libations  to  the <br/>gods,  it  was  not  because  they  looked  upon  it  as  in  its  own  nature  acceptable  to  them;  but  they  poured <br/>it  upon  their  altars  as  the  blood  of  those  enemies  who  formerly  had  fought  against  them.  For  they <br/>look  upon  the  vine  to  have  first  sprung  out  of  the  earth  after  it  was  fattened  with  the  carcasses  of <br/>those  who  fell  in  the  wars  against  the  gods.  And  this,  say  they,  is  the  reason  why  drinking  its  juice  in <br/>great  quantities  makes  men  mad  and  beside  themselves,  filling  them  as  it  were  with  the  blood  of  their <br/>own  ancestors.&quot;  (See  Isis  and  Osiris.) <br/><br/>Among  some  cults  the  state  of  intoxication  was  viewed  as  a  condition  somewhat  akin  to  ecstasy,  for <br/>the  individual  was  believed  to  be  possessed  by  the  Universal  Spirit  of  Life,  whose  chosen  vehicle  was <br/>the  vine.  In  the  Mysteries,  the  grape  was  often  used  to  symbolize  lust  and  debauchery  because  of  its <br/>demoralizing  effect  upon  the  emotional  nature.  The  fact  was  recognized,  however,  that  fermentation <br/>was  the  certain  evidence  of  the  presence  of  the  solar  fire,  hence  the  grape  was  accepted  as  the  proper <br/>symbol  of  the  Solar  Spirit &#x2014;the  giver  of  divine  enthusiasm.  In  a  somewhat  similar  manner.  Christians <br/>have  accepted  wine  as  the  emblem  of  the  blood  of  Christ,  partaking  of  it  in  Holy  Communion.  Christ, <br/>the  exoteric  emblem  of  the  Solar  Spirit,  said,  &quot;I  am  the  vine.&quot;  He  was  therefore  worshiped  with  the <br/>wine  of  ecstasy  in  the  same  manner  as  were  his  pagan  prototypes&#x2014; Bacchus,  Dionysos,  Arys,  and <br/>Adonis. <br/><br/>The  mandragora  offtcinarum,  or  mandrake,  is  accredited  with  possessing  the  most  remarkable <br/>magical  powers.  Its  narcotic  properties  were  recognized  by  the  Greeks,  who  employed  it  to  deaden <br/>pain  during  surgical  operations,  and  it  has  been  identified  also  with  baaras,  the  mystic  herb  used  by <br/>the  Jews  for  casting  out  demons.  In  the  Jewish  Wars,  Josephus  describes  the  method  of  securing  the <br/>baaras,  which  he  declares  emits  flashes  of  lightning  and  destroys  all  who  seek  to  touch  it,  unless  they <br/>proceed  according  to  certain  rules  supposedly  formulated  by  King  Solomon  himself. <br/><br/>The  occult  properties  of  the  mandrake,  while  little  understood,  have  been  responsible  for  the <br/>adoption  of  the  plant  as  a  talisman  capable  of  increasing  the  value  or  quantity  of  anything  with  which <br/>it  was  associated.  As  a  phallic  charm,  the  mandrake  was  considered  to  be  an  infallible  cure  for  sterility. <br/><br/><br/>It  was  one  of  the  Priapic  symbols  which  the  Knights  Templars  were  accused  of  worshiping.  The  root <br/><br/>of  the  plant  closely  resembles  a  human  body  and  often  bore  the  outlines  of  the  human  head,  arms,  or <br/>legs.  This  striking  similarity  between  the  body  of  man  and  the  mandragora  is  one  of  the  puzzles  of <br/>natural  science  and  is  the  real  basis  for  the  veneration  in  which  this  plant  was  held.  In  Isis  Unveiled, <br/>Madam  Blavatsky  notes  that  the  mandragora  seems  to  occupy  upon  earth  the  point  where  the <br/>vegetable  and  animal  kingdoms  meet,  as  the  zoophites  and  polypi  do  in  die  sea.  This  thought  opens  a <br/>vast  field  of  speculation  concerning  the  nature  of  this  animal-plant. <br/><br/>According  to  a  popular  superstition,  the  mandrake  shrank  from  being  touched  and,  crying  out  with  a <br/>human  voice,  clung  desperately  to  the  soil  in  which  it  was  imbedded.  Anyone  who  heard  its  cry  while <br/>plucking  it  either  immediately  died  or  went  mad.  To  circumvent  this  tragedy,  it  was  customary  to  dig <br/>around  the  roots  of  the  mandrake  until  the  plant  was  thoroughly  loosened  and  then  to  tie  one  end  of  a <br/>cord  about  the  stalk  and  fasten  the  other  end  to  a  dog.  The  dog,  obeying  his  master's  call,  thereupon <br/>dragged  the  root  from  the  earth  and  became  the  victim  of  the  mandragora  curse.  When  once  uprooted, <br/>the  plant  could  be  handled  with  immunity. <br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages,  mandrake  charms  brought  great  prices  and  an  art  was  evolved  by  which  the <br/>resemblance  between  the  mandragora  root  and  the  human  body  was  considerably  accentuated.  Like <br/>most  superstitions,  the  belief  in  the  peculiar  powers  of  the  mandrake  was  founded  upon  an  ancient <br/>secret  doctrine  concerning  the  true  nature  of  the  plant.  &quot;It  is  slightly  narcotic,&quot;  says  Eliphas  Levi,  &quot;and <br/>an  aphrodisiacal  virtue  was  ascribed  to  it  by  the  ancients,  who  represented  it  as  being  sought  by <br/>Thessalian  sorcerers  for  the  composition  of  philtres.  Is  this  root  the  umbilical  vestige  of  our  terrestrial <br/>origin,  as  a  certain  magical  mysticism  has  suggested?  We  dare  not  affirm  it  seriously,  but  it  is  true  all <br/>the  same  that  man  issued  from  the  slime  of  earth  and  his  first  appearance  must  have  been  in  the  form <br/>of  a  rough  sketch.  The  analogies  of  Nature  compel  us  to  admit  the  notion,  at  least  as  a  possibility.  The <br/>first  men  were,  in  this  case,  a  family  of  gigantic,  sensitive  mandrogores,  animated  by  the  sun,  who <br/>rooted  themselves  up  from  the  earth.&quot;  (See  Transcendental  Magic.) <br/><br/>The  homely  onion  was  revered  by  the  Egyptians  as  a  symbol  of  the  universe  because  its  rings  and <br/>layers  represented  the  concentric  planes  into  which  creation  was  divided  according  to  the  Hermetic <br/>Mysteries.  It  was  also  regarded  as  possessing  great  medicinal  virtue.  Because  of  peculiar  properties <br/>resulting  from  its  pungency,  the  garlic  plant  was  a  powerful  agent  in  transcendental  magic.  To  this <br/>day  no  better  medium  has  been  found  for  the  treatment  of  obsession.  Vampirism  and  certain  forms  of <br/>insanity&#x2014;especially  those  resulting  from  mediumship  and  the  influences  of  elemental  larvae&#x2014;respond <br/>immediately  to  the  use  of  garlic.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  its  presence  in  a  house  was  believed  to  ward  off <br/>all  evil  powers. <br/><br/>Trifoliate  plants,  such  as  the  shamrock,  were  employed  by  many  religious  cults  to  represent  the <br/>principle  of  the  Trinity.  St.  Patrick  is  supposed  to  have  used  the  shamrock  to  illustrate  this  doctrine  of <br/>the  triune  Divinity.  The  reason  for  the  additional  sanctity  conferred  by  a  fourth  leaf  is  that  the  fourth <br/>principle  of  the  Trinity  is  man,  and  the  presence  of  this  leaf  therefore  signifies  the  redemption  of <br/>humanity. <br/><br/>Wreaths  were  worn  during  initiation  into  the  Mysteries  and  the  reading  of  the  sacred  books  to  signify <br/>that  these  processes  were  consecrated  to  the  deities.  On  the  symbolism  of  wreaths,  Richard  Payne <br/>Knight  writes:  &quot;Instead  of  beads,  wreaths  of  foliage,  generally  of  laurel,  olive,  myrtle,  ivy,  or  oak, <br/>appear  upon  coins,  sometimes  encircling  the  symbolical  figures,  and  sometimes  as  chaplets  upon <br/>their  heads.  All  these  were  sacred  to  some  peculiar  personifications  of  the  deity,  and  significant  of <br/>some  particular  attributes,  and,  in  general,  all  evergreens  were  Dionysiac  planes;  that  is,  symbols  of <br/>the  generative  power,  signifying  perpetuity  of  youth  and  vigor,  as  the  circles  of  beads  and  diadems <br/>signify  perpetuity  of  existence.  (See  Symbolical  Language  of  Ancient  Art  and  Mythology.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  TREE  OF  ALCHEMY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Museum  Hermeticum  Reformatum  et  Amplificatum. <br/><br/>The  alchemists  were  went  to  symbohze  their  metals  by  means  of  a  tree,  to  indicate  that  all  seven  were  branches  dependent <br/>upon  the  single  trunk  of  solar  life.  As  the  Seven  Spirits  depend  upon  God  and  are  branches  of  a  tree  of  which  He  is  the  root, <br/>trunk,  and  the  spiritual  earth  from  which  the  root  derives  its  nourishment,  so  the  single  trunk  of  divine  life  and  power <br/>nourishes  all  the  multitudinous  forms  of  which  the  universe  is  composed. <br/><br/>In  Gloria  Mundi,  from  which  the  above  illustration  is  reproduced,  there  is  contained  an  important  thought  concerning  the <br/>plantlike  growth  of  metals:  &quot;All  trees,  herbs,  stones,  metals,  and  minerals  grow  and  attain  to  perfection  without  being <br/>necessarily  touched  by  any  human  hand:  for  the  seed  is  raised  up  from  the  ground,  puts  forth  flowers,  and  bears  fruit, <br/>simply  through  the  agency  of  natural  influences.  As  it  is  with  plants,  so  it  is  with  metals.  While  they  lie  in  the  heart  of  the <br/>earth,  in  their  natural  ore,  they  grow  and  are  developed,  day  by  day,  through  the  influence  of  the  four  elements:  their  fire <br/>is  the  splendor  of  the  Sun  and  Moon;  the  earth  conceives  in  her  womb  the  splendor  of  the  Sun,  and  by  it  the  seeds  of  the <br/>metals  are  well  and  equally  warmed,  just  like  the  grain  in  the  fields.  *  *  *  For  as  each  tree  of  the  field  has  its  own  peculiar <br/>shape,  appearance,  and  fruit,  so  each  mountain  bears  its  own  particular  ore;  those  stones  and  that  earth  being  the  soil  in <br/>which  the  metals  grow.&quot;  (See  Translation  of  1893.) <br/><br/><br/>P-  97 <br/><br/><br/>Stones,  Metals  and  Gems <br/><br/>EACH  of  the  four  primary  elements  as  taught  by  the  early  philosophers  has  its  analogue  in  the <br/>quaternary  terrestrial  constitution  of  man.  The  rocks  and  earth  correspond  to  the  bones  and  flesh;  the <br/>water  to  the  various  fluids;  the  air  to  the  gases;  and  the  fire  to  the  bodily  heat.  Since  the  bones  are  the <br/>framework  that  sustains  the  corporeal  structure,  they  maybe  regarded  as  a  fitting  emblem  of  the <br/>spirit&#x2014;that  divine  foundation  which  supports  the  composite  fabric  of  mind,  soul,  and  body.  To  the <br/>initiate,  the  skeleton  of  death  holding  in  bony  fingers  the  reaper's  scythe  denotes  Saturn  (Kronos),  the <br/>father  of  the  gods,  carrying  the  sickle  with  which  he  mutilated  Ouranos,  his  own  sire. <br/><br/>In  the  language  of  the  Mysteries,  the  spirits  of  men  are  the  powdered  bones  of  Saturn.  The  latter <br/>deity  was  always  worshiped  under  the  symbol  of  the  base  or  footing,  inasmuch  as  he  was  considered <br/>to  be  the  substructure  upholding  creation.  The  myth  of  Saturn  has  its  historical  basis  in  the <br/>fragmentary  records  preserved  by  the  early  Greeks  and  Phoenicians  concerning  a  king  by  that  name <br/>who  ruled  over  the  ancient  continent  of  Hyperborea.  Polaris,  Hyperborea,  and  Atlantis,  because  they <br/>lie  buried  beneath  the  continents  and  oceans  of  the  modern  world,  have  frequently  been  symbolized <br/>as  rocks  supporting  upon  their  broad  surfaces  new  lands,  races,  and  empires.  According  to  the <br/>Scandinavian  Mysteries,  the  stones  and  cliffs  were  formed  from  the  bones  of  Ymir,  the  primordial <br/>giant  of  the  seething  clay,  while  to  the  Hellenic  mystics  the  rocks  were  the  bones  of  the  Great  Mother, <br/>Gsea. <br/><br/>After  the  deluge  sent  by  the  gods  to  destroy  mankind  at  the  close  of  the  Iron  Age,  only  Deucalion  and <br/>Pyrrha  were  left  alive.  Entering  a  ruined  sanctuary  to  pray,  they  were  directed  by  an  oracle  to  depart <br/>from  the  temple  and  with  heads  veiled  and  garments  unbound  cast  behind  them  the  bones  of  their <br/>mother.  Construing  the  cryptic  message  of  the  god  to  mean  that  the  earth  was  the  Great  Mother  of  all <br/>creatures,  Deucalion  picked  up  loose  rocks  and,  bidding  Pyrrha  do  likewise,  cast  them  behind  him. <br/>From  these  rocks  there  sprang  forth  a  new  and  stalwart  race  of  human  beings,  the  rocks  thrown  by <br/>Deucalion  becoming  men  and  those  thrown  by  Pyrrha  becoming  women.  In  this  allegory  is <br/>epitomized  the  mystery  of  human  evolution;  for  spirit,  by  ensouling  matter,  becomes  that  indwelling <br/>power  which  gradually  but  sequentially  raises  the  mineral  to  the  status  of  the  plant;  the  plant  to  the <br/>plane  of  the  animal;  the  animal  to  the  dignity  of  man;  and  man  to  the  estate  of  the  gods. <br/><br/>The  solar  system  was  organized  by  forces  operating  inward  from  the  great  ring  of  the  Saturnian <br/>sphere;  and  since  the  beginnings  of  all  things  were  under  the  control  of  Saturn,  the  most  reasonable <br/>inference  is  that  the  first  forms  of  worship  were  dedicated  to  him  and  his  peculiar  symbol&#x2014;the  stone. <br/>Thus  the  intrinsic  nature  of  Saturn  is  synonymous  with  that  spiritual  rock  which  is  the  enduring <br/>foundation  of  the  Solar  Temple,  and  has  its  antitype  or  lower  octave  in  that  terrestrial  rock&#x2014; the <br/>planet  Earth&#x2014; which  sustains  upon  its  jagged  surface  the  diversified  genera  of  mundane  life. <br/><br/>Although  its  origin  is  uncertain,  litholatry  undoubtedly  constitutes  one  of  the  earliest  forms  of <br/>religious  expression.  &quot;Throughout  all  the  world, &quot;  writes  Godfrey  Higgins,  &quot;the  first  object  of  Idolatry <br/>seems  to  have  been  a  plain,  unwrought  stone,  placed  in  the  ground,  as  an  emblem  of  the  generative  or <br/>procreative  powers  of  nature.&quot;  (See  The  Celtic  Druids.)  Remnants  of  stone  worship  are  distributed <br/>over  the  greater  part  of  the  earth's  surface,  a  notable  example  being  the  menhirs  at  Carnac,  in <br/>Brittany,  where  several  thousand  gigantic  uncut  stones  are  arranged  in  eleven  orderly  rows.  Many  of <br/>these  monoliths  stand  over  twenty  feet  out  of  the  sand  in  which  they  are  embedded,  and  it  has  been <br/>calculated  that  some  of  the  larger  ones  weigh  as  much  as  250,000  pounds.  By  some  it  is  believed  that <br/>certain  of  the  menhirs  mark  the  location  of  buried  treasure,  but  the  most  plausible  view  is  that  which <br/>regards  Carnac  as  a  monument  to  the  astronomical  knowledge  of  antiquity.  Scattered  throughout  the <br/><br/><br/>British  Isles  and  Europe,  these  cairns,  dolmens,  menhirs,  and  cistvaens  stand  as  mute  but  eloquent <br/>testimonials  to  the  existence  and  achievements  of  races  now  extinct. <br/><br/>Of  particular  interest  are  the  rocking  or  logan  stones,  which  evince  the  mechanical  skill  of  these  early <br/>peoples.  These  relics  consist  of  enormous  boulders  poised  upon  one  or  two  small  points  in  such  a <br/>manner  that  the  slightest  pressure  will  sway  them,  but  the  greatest  effort  is  not  sufficient  to <br/>overthrow  them.  These  were  called  living  stones  by  the  Greeks  and  Latins,  the  most  famous  one  being <br/>the  Gygorian  stone  in  the  Strait  of  Gibraltar.  Though  so  perfectly  balanced  that  it  could  be  moved <br/>with  the  stalk  of  a  daffodil,  this  rock  could  not  be  upset  by  the  combined  weight  of  many  men.  There <br/>is  a  legend  that  Hercules  raised  a  rocking  stone  over  the  graves  of  the  two  sons  of  Boreas  whom  he <br/>had  killed  in  combat.  This  stone  was  so  delicately  poised  that  it  swayed  back  and  forth  with  the  wind, <br/>but  no  application  of  force  could  overturn  it.  A  number  of  logan  stones  have  been  found  in  Britain, <br/>traces  of  one  no  longer  standing  having  been  discovered  in  Stonehenge.  (See  The  Celtic  Druids.)  It  is <br/>interesting  to  note  that  the  green  stones  forming  the  inner  ring  of  Stonehenge  are  believed  to  have <br/>been  brought  from  Africa. <br/><br/>In  many  cases  the  monoliths  are  without  carving  or  inscription,  for  they  undoubtedly  antedate  both <br/>the  use  of  tools  and  the  art  of  writing.  In  some  instances  the  stones  have  been  trued  into  columns  or <br/>obelisks,  as  in  the  runic  monuments  and  the  Hindu  lingams  and  sakti  stones;  in  other  instances  they <br/>are  fashioned  into  rough  likenesses  of  the  human  body,  as  in  the  Easter  Island  statues,  or  into  the <br/>elaborately  sculptured  figures  of  the  Central  American  Indians  and  the  Khmers  of  Cambodia.  The <br/>first  rough-stone  images  can  hardly  be  considered  as  effigies  of  any  particular  deity  but  rather  as  the <br/>crude  effort  of  primitive  man  to  portray  in  the  enduring  qualities  of  stone  the  procreative  attributes  of <br/>abstract  Divinity.  An  instinctive  recognition  of  the  stability  of  Deity  has  persisted  through  all  the <br/>intervening  ages  between  primitive  man  and  modem  civilization.  Ample  proof  of  the  survival  of <br/>litholatry  in  the  Christian  faith  is  furnished  by  allusions  to  the  rock  of  refuge,  the  rock  upon  which  the <br/>church  of  Christ  was  to  be  founded,  the  comer  stone  which  the  builders  rejected,  Jacob's  stony  pillow <br/>which  he  set  up  and  anointed  with  oil,  the  sling  stone  of  David,  the  rock  Moriah  upon  which  the  altar <br/>of  King  Solomon's  Temple  was  erected,  the  white  stone  of  Revelation,  and  the  Rock  of  Ages. <br/><br/>Stones  were  highly  venerated  by  prehistoric  peoples  primarily  because  of  their  usefulness.  Jagged  bits <br/>of  stone  were  probably  man's  first  weapons;  rocky  cliffs  and  crags  constituted  his  first  fortifications, <br/>and  from  these  vantage  points  he  hurled  loose  boulders  down  upon  marauders.  In  caverns  or  rude <br/>huts  fashioned  from  slabs  of  rock  the  first  humans  protected  themselves  from  the  rigors  of  the <br/>elements.  Stones  were  set  up  as  markers  and  monuments  to  primitive  achievement;  they  were  also <br/>placed  upon  the  graves  of  the  dead,  probably  as  a  precautionary  measure  to  prevent  the  depredations <br/>of  wild  beasts.  During  migrations,  it  was  apparently  customary  for  primitive  peoples  to  carry  about <br/>with  them  stones  taken  from  their  original  habitat.  As  the  homeland  or  birthplace  of  a  race  was <br/>considered  sacred,  these  stones  were  emblematic  of  that  universal  regard  shared  by  all  nations  for  the <br/>place  of  their  geniture.  The  discovery  that  fire  could  be  produced  by  striking  together  two  pieces  of <br/>stone  augmented  man's  reverence  for  stones,  but  ultimately  the  hitherto  unsuspected  world  of <br/>wonders  opened  by  the  newly  discovered  element  of  fire  caused  pyrolatry  to  supplant  stone  worship. <br/>The  dark,  cold  Father~stone~gave  birth  out  of  itself  to  the  bright,  glowing  Son-fire;  and  the  newly <br/>born  flame,  by  displacing  its  parent,  became  the  most  impressive  and  mysterious  of  all  religio- <br/>philosophic  symbols,  widespread  and  enduring  through  the  ages. <br/><br/><br/>SATURN  SWALLOWING  THE  STONE  SUBSTITUTED  FOR  JUPITER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Catrari's  Imagini  degli  Dei  degli  Antichi. <br/><br/>Saturn,  having  been  warned  by  his  parents  that  one  of  his  own  children  would  dethrone  him,  devoured  each  child  at  birth. <br/><br/>At  last  Rhea,  his  wife,  in  order  to  save  Jupiter,  her  sixth  child  substituted  for  him  a  rock  enveloped  in  swaddling  clothes&#x2014; <br/>which  Saturn,  ignorant  of  the  deception  practiced  upon  him,  immediately  swallowed.  Jupiter  was  concealed  on  the  island <br/>of  Crete  until  he  attained  manhood,  when  he  forced  his  father  to  disgorge  the  five  children  he  had  eaten.  The  stone <br/>swallowed  by  Saturn  in  lieu  of  his  youngest  son  was  placed  by  Jupiter  at  Delphi,  where  it  was  held  in  great  veneration  and <br/>was  daily  anointed. <br/><br/>p.  98 <br/><br/>The  body  of  every  thing  v\^as  hkened  to  a  rock,  trued  either  into  a  cube  or  more  ornately  chiseled  to <br/>form  a  pedestal,  while  the  spirit  of  everything  was  likened  to  the  elaborately  carved  figure <br/>surmounting  it.  Accordingly,  altars  were  erected  as  a  symbol  of  the  lower  world,  and  fires  were  kept <br/>burning  upon  them  to  represent  that  spiritual  essence  illuminating  the  body  it  surmounted.  The <br/>square  is  actually  one  surface  of  a  cube,  its  corresponding  figure  in  plane  geometry,  and  its  proper <br/>philosophic  symbol.  Consequently,  when  considering  the  earth  as  an  element  and  not  as  a  body,  the <br/>Greeks,  Brahmins,  and  Egyptians  always  referred  to  its  four  corners,  although  they  were  fully  aware <br/>that  the  planet  itself  was  a  sphere. <br/><br/>Because  their  doctrines  were  the  sure  foundation  of  all  knowledge  and  the  first  step  in  the  attainment <br/>of  conscious  immortality,  the  Mysteries  were  often  represented  as  cubical  or  pyramidal  stones. <br/>Conversely,  these  stones  themselves  became  the  emblem  of  that  condition  of  self-achieved  godhood. <br/>The  unchangeability  of  the  stone  made  it  an  appropriate  emblem  of  God&#x2014;the  immovable  and <br/>unchangeable  Source  of  Existence&#x2014;and  also  of  the  divine  sciences&#x2014; the  eternal  revelation  of  Himself <br/>to  mankind.  As  the  personification  of  the  rational  intellect,  which  is  the  true  foundation  of  human  life. <br/>Mercury,  or  Hermes,  was  symbolized  in  a  like  manner.  Square  or  cylindrical  pillars,  surmounted  by  a <br/>bearded  head  of  Hermes  and  called  hermae,  were  set  up  in  public  places.  Terminus,  a  form  of  Jupiter <br/>and  god  of  boundaries  and  highways,  from  whose  name  is  derived  the  modern  word  terminal,  was <br/>also  symbolized  by  an  upright  stone,  sometimes  ornamented  with  the  head  of  the  god,  which  was <br/>placed  at  the  borders  of  provinces  and  the  intersections  of  important  roads. <br/><br/>The  philosopher's  stone  is  really  the  philosophical  stone,  for  philosophy  is  truly  likened  to  a  magic <br/>jewel  whose  touch  transmutes  base  substances  into  priceless  gems  like  itself.  Wisdom  is  the <br/>alchemist's  powder  of  projection  which  transforms  many  thousand  times  its  own  weight  of  gross <br/>ignorance  into  the  precious  substance  of  enlightenment. <br/><br/><br/>THE  TABLETS  OF  THE  LAW <br/><br/><br/>While  upon  the  heights  of  Mount  Sinai,  Moses  received  from  Jehovah  two  tablets  bearing  the <br/>characters  of  the  Decalogue  traced  by  the  very  finger  of  Israel's  God.  These  tables  were  fashioned <br/>from  the  divine  sapphire,  Schethiya,  which  the  Most  High,  after  removing  from  His  own  throne,  had <br/>cast  into  the  Abyss  to  become  the  foundation  and  generator  of  the  worlds.  This  sacred  stone,  formed <br/>of  heavenly  dew,  was  sundered  by  the  breath  of  God,  and  upon  the  two  parts  were  drawn  in  black  fire <br/>the  figures  of  the  Law.  These  precious  inscriptions,  aglow  with  celestial  splendor,  were  delivered  by <br/>the  Lord  on  the  Sabbath  day  into  the  hands  of  Moses,  who  was  able  to  read  the  illumined  letters  from <br/>the  reverse  side  because  of  the  transparency  of  the  great  jewel.  (See  The  Secret  Doctrine  in  Israel  or <br/>The  Zohar  for  details  of  this  legend.) <br/><br/>The  Ten  Commandments  are  the  ten  shining  gems  placed  by  the  Holy  One  in  the  sapphire  sea  of <br/>Being,  and  in  the  depths  of  matter  the  reflections  of  these  jewels  are  seen  as  the  laws  governing  the <br/>sublunary  spheres.  They  are  the  sacred  ten  by  which  the  Supreme  Deity  has  stamped  His  will  upon <br/>the  face  of  Nature.  This  same  decad  was  celebrated  by  the  Pythagoreans  under  the  form  of  the <br/>tetractys&#x2014;that  triangle  of  spermatic  points  which  reveals  to  the  initiated  the  whole  working  of  the <br/>cosmic  scheme;  for  ten  is  the  number  of  perfection,  the  key  to  creation,  and  the  proper  symbol  of  God, <br/>man,  and  the  universe. <br/><br/>Because  of  the  idolatry  of  the  Israelites,  Moses  deemed  the  people  unworthy  to  receive  the  sapphire <br/>tables;  hence  he  destroyed  them,  that  the  Mysteries  of  Jehovah  should  not  be  violated.  For  the <br/>original  set  Moses  substituted  two  tablets  of  rough  stone  into  the  surface  of  which  he  had  cut  ten <br/>ancient  letters.  While  the  former  tables&#x2014;partaking  of  the  divinity  of  the  Tree  of  Life&#x2014;blazed  forth <br/>eternal  verities,  the  latter&#x2014; partaking  of  the  nature  of  the  Tree  of  Good  and  Evil&#x2014; revealed  only <br/>temporal  truths.  Thus  the  ancient  tradition  of  Israel  returned  again  to  heaven,  leaving  only  its  shadow <br/>with  the  children  of  the  twelve  tribes. <br/><br/>One  of  the  two  tables  of  stone  delivered  by  the  Lawgiver  to  his  followers  stood  for  the  oral,  the  other <br/>for  the  written  traditions  upon  which  the  Rabbinical  School  was  founded.  Authorities  differ  widely  as <br/>to  the  size  and  substance  of  the  inferior  tables.  Some  describe  them  as  being  so  small  that  they  could <br/>be  held  in  the  hollow  of  a  man's  hand;  others  declare  that  each  table  was  ten  or  twelve  cubits  in  length <br/>and  of  enormous  weight.  A  few  even  deny  that  the  tables  were  of  stone,  maintaining  that  they  were  of <br/>a  wood  called  sedr,  which,  according  to  the  Mohammedans,  grows  profusely  in  Paradise. <br/><br/>The  two  tables  signify  respectively  the  superior  and  the  inferior  worlds&#x2014; the  paternal  and  the <br/>maternal  formative  principles.  In  their  undivided  state  they  represent  the  Cosmic  Androgyne.  The <br/>breaking  of  the  tables  signifies  obscurely  the  separation  of  the  superior  and  the  inferior  spheres  and <br/>also  the  division  of  the  sexes.  In  the  religious  processionals  of  the  Greeks  and  Egyptians  an  ark  or  ship <br/>was  carried  which  contained  stone  tablets,  cones,  and  vessels  of  various  shapes  emblematic  of  the <br/>procreative  processes.  The  Ark  of  the  Israelites&#x2014; which  was  patterned  after  the  sacred  chests  of  the <br/>Isiac  Mysteries&#x2014; contained  three  holy  objects,  each  having  an  important  phallic  interpretation:  the <br/>pot  of  manna,  the  rod  that  budded,  and  the  Tablets  of  the  Law&#x2014; the  first,  second,  and  third  Principles <br/>of  the  Creative  Triad.  The  manna,  the  blossoming  staff,  and  the  stone  tables  are  also  appropriate <br/>images  respectively  of  the  Qabbalah,  the  Mishna,  and  the  written  law&#x2014; the  spirit,  soul,  and  body  of <br/>Judaism.  When  placed  in  King  Solomon's  Everlasting  House,  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  contained  only <br/>the  Tablets  of  the  Law.  Does  this  indicate  that  even  at  that  early  date  the  secret  tradition  had  been  lost <br/>and  the  letter  of  the  revelation  alone  remained? <br/><br/>As  representing  the  power  that  fabricated  the  lower,  or  Demiurgic,  sphere,  the  tablets  of  stone  were <br/>sacred  to  Jehovah  in  contradistinction  to  the  tablets  of  sapphire  that  signified  the  potency  that <br/>established  the  higher,  or  celestial,  sphere.  Without  doubt  the  Mosaic  tablets  have  their  prototype  in <br/>the  stone  pillars  or  obelisks  placed  on  either  side  of  the  entrance  to  pagan  temples.  These  columns <br/><br/><br/>may  pertain  to  that  remote  time  when  men  worshiped  the  Creator  through  His  zodiacal  sign  of <br/>Gemini,  the  symbol  of  which  is  still  the  phallic  pillars  of  the  Celestial  Twins.  &quot;The  Ten <br/>Commandments,  writes  Hargrave  Jennings,  &quot;are  inscribed  in  two  groups  of  five  each,  in  columnar <br/>form.  The  five  to  the  right  (looking  from  the  altar)  mean  the  'Law';  the  five  to  the  left  mean  the <br/>'Prophets.'  The  right  stone  is  masculine,  the  left  stone  is  feminine.  They  correspond  to  the  two <br/>disjoined  pillars  of  stone  (or  towers)  in  the  front  of  every  cathedral,  and  of  every  temple  in  the <br/>heathen  times.&quot;  (See  The  Rosicrucians:  Their  Rites  and  Mysteries.)  The  same  author  states  that  the <br/>Law  is  masculine  because  it  was  delivered  direct  from  the  Deity,  while  the  Prophets,  or  Gospels,  were <br/>feminine  because  bom  through  the  nature  of  man. <br/><br/>The  right  Tablet  of  the  Law  further  signifies  Jachin&#x2014; the  white  pillar  of  light;  the  left  Tablet,  Boaz&#x2014; the <br/>shadowy  pillar  of  darkness.  These  were  the  names  of  the  two  pillars  cast  from  brass  set  up  on  the <br/>porch  of  King  Solomon's  Temple.  They  were  eighteen  cubits  in  height  and  beautifully  ornamented <br/>with  wreaths  of  chainwork,  nets,  and  pomegranates.  On  the  top  of  each  pillar  was  a  large  bowl&#x2014;now <br/>erroneously  called  a  ball  or  globe&#x2014;one  of  the  bowls  probably  containing  fire  and  the  other  water.  The <br/>celestial  globe  (originally  the  bowl  of  fire),  surmounting  the  right-hand  column  (Jachin),  symbolized <br/>the  divine  man;  the  terrestrial  globe  (the  bowl  of  water),  surmounting  the  left-hand  column  (Boaz), <br/>signified  the  earthly  man.  These  two  pillars  respectively  connote  also  the  active  and  the  passive <br/>expressions  of  Divine  Energy,  the  sun  and  the  moon,  sulphur  and  salt,  good  and  bad,  light  and <br/>darkness.  Between  them  is  the  door  leading  into  the  House  of  God,  and  standing  thus  at  the  gates  of <br/>Sanctuary  they  are  a  reminder  that  Jehovah  is  both  an  androgynous  and  an  anthropomorphic  deity. <br/>As  two  parallel  columns  they  denote  the  zodiacal  signs  of  Cancer  and  Capricorn,  which  were  formerly <br/>placed  in  the  chamber  of  initiation  to  represent  birth  and  death&#x2014; the  extremes  of  physical  life.  They <br/>accordingly  signify  the  summer  and  the  winter  solstices,  now  known  to  Freemasons  under  the <br/>comparatively  modem  appellation  of  the  &quot;two  St.  Johns.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  mysterious  Sephirothic  Tree  of  the  Jews,  these  two  pillars  symbolize  Mercy  and  Severity. <br/>Standing  before  the  gate  of  King  Solomon's  Temple,  these  columns  had  the  same  symbolic  import  as <br/>the  obelisks  before  the  sanctuaries  of  Egypt.  When  interpreted  Qabbalistically,  the  names  of  the  two <br/>pillars  mean  &quot;In  strength  shall <br/><br/><br/>ExoD-Xjs  GHAP.xm <br/><br/><br/>Exodus  jiYerifiiS, <br/><br/><br/>MOSES  RECEIVING  THE  TABLES  OF  THE  LAW. <br/><br/><br/>From  an  old  Bible. <br/><br/><br/>Moses  Maimonides,  the  great  Jewish  Philosopher  of  the  twelfth  century,  in  describing  the  Tables  of  the  Law  written  by  the <br/>finger  of  God,  divides  all  productions  into  two  general  orders:  products  of  Nature  and  products  of  art.  God  works  through <br/>Nature  and  man  through  art,  he  asserts  in  his  Guide  for  the  Perplexed.  Thus  the  Word  of  the  Lord  is  the  hand,  or  active <br/>principle,  by  which  the  will  of  the  Creator  is  traced  upon  the  face  of  His  creation.  The  Tannaim,  or  initiates  of  the  Jewish <br/>Mystery  School,  alone  possessed  a  complete  understanding  of  the  significance  of  the  Ten  Commandments.  These  laws  are <br/>esoterically  related  to  the  ten  degrees  of  contemplation  constituting  the  Path  of  Ecstasy,  which  winds  upward  through  he <br/>four  worlds  and  ends  in  the  effulgence  of  AIN  SOPH. <br/><br/>P-  99 <br/><br/>My  House  be  established.  &quot;In  the  splendor  of  mental  and  spiritual  illumination,  the  High  Priest  stood <br/>between  the  pillars  as  a  mute  witness  to  the  perfect  virtue  of  equilibrium&#x2014;that  hypothetical  point <br/>equidistant  from  all  extremes.  He  thus  personified  the  divine  nature  of  man  in  the  midst  of  his <br/>compound  constitution&#x2014; the  mysterious  Pythagorean  Monad  in  the  presence  of  the  Duad.  On  one  side <br/>towered  the  stupendous  column  of  the  intellect;  on  the  other,  the  brazen  pillar  of  the  flesh.  Midway <br/>between  these  two  stands  the  glorified  wise  man,  but  he  cannot  reach  this  high  estate  without  first <br/>suffering  upon  the  cross  made  by  joining  these  pillars  together.  The  early  Jews  occasionally <br/>represented  the  two  pillars,  Jachin  and  Boaz,  as  the  legs  of  Jehovah,  thereby  signifying  to  the  modern <br/>philosopher  that  Wisdom  and  Love,  in  their  most  exalted  sense,  support  the  whole  order  of  creation&#x2014; <br/>both  mundane  and  supermundane. <br/><br/>THE  HOLY  GRAIL <br/><br/>Like  the  sapphire  Schethiya,  the  Lapis  Exilis,  crown  jewel  of  the  Archangel  Lucifer,  fell  from  heaven. <br/>Michael,  archangel  of  the  sun  and  the  Hidden  God  of  Israel,  at  the  head  of  the  angelic  hosts  swooped <br/>down  upon  Lucifer  and  his  legions  of  rebellious  spirits.  During  the  conflict,  Michael  with  his  flaming <br/>sword  struck  the  flashing  Lapis  Exilis  from  the  coronet  of  his  adversary,  and  the  green  stone  fell <br/>through  all  the  celestial  rings  into  the  dark  and  immeasurable  Abyss.  Out  of  Lucifer's  radiant  gem  was <br/>fashioned  the  Sangreal,  or  Holy  Grail,  from  which  Christ  is  said  to  have  drunk  at  the  Last  Supper. <br/><br/>Though  some  controversy  exists  as  to  whether  the  Grail  was  a  cup  or  a  platter,  it  is  generally  depicted <br/>in  art  as  a  chalice  of  considerable  size  and  unusual  beauty.  According  to  the  legend,  Joseph  of <br/>Arimathea  brought  the  Grail  Cup  to  the  place  of  the  crucifixion  and  in  it  caught  the  blood  pouring <br/>from  the  wounds  of  the  dying  Nazarene.  Later  Joseph,  who  had  become  custodian  of  the  sacred <br/>relics&#x2014;the  Sangreal  and  the  Spear  of  Longinus&#x2014; carried  them  into  a  distant  country.  According  to  one <br/>version,  his  descendants  finally  placed  these  relics  in  Glastonbury  Abbey  in  England;  according  to <br/>another,  in  a  wonderful  castle  on  Mount  Salvat,  Spain,  built  by  angels  in  a  single  night.  Under  the <br/>name  of  Preston  John,  Parsifal,  the  last  of  the  Grail  Kings,  carried  the  Holy  Cup  with  him  into  India, <br/>and  it  disappeared  forever  from  the  Western  World.  Subsequent  search  for  the  Sangreal  was  the  motif <br/>for  much  of  the  knight  errantry  of  the  Arthurian  legends  and  the  ceremonials  of  the  Round  Table. <br/>(See  the  Morte  d' Arthur.) <br/><br/>No  adequate  interpretation  has  ever  been  given  to  the  Grail  Mysteries.  Some  believe  the  Knights  of <br/>the  Holy  Grail  to  have  been  a  powerful  organization  of  Christian  mystics  perpetuating  the  Ancient <br/>Wisdom  under  the  rituals  and  sacraments  of  the  oracular  Cup.  The  quest  for  the  Holy  Grail  is  the <br/>eternal  search  for  truth,  and  Albert  G.  Mackey  sees  in  it  a  variation  of  the  Masonic  legend  of  the  Lost <br/>Word  so  long  sought  by  the  brethren  of  the  Craft.  There  is  also  evidence  to  support  the  claim  that  the <br/>story  of  the  Grail  is  an  elaboration  of  an  early  pagan  Nature  myth  which  has  been  preserved  by  reason <br/>of  the  subtle  manner  in  which  it  was  engrafted  upon  the  cult  of  Christianity.  From  this  particular <br/>viewpoint,  the  Holy  Grail  is  undoubtedly  a  type  of  the  ark  or  vessel  in  which  the  life  of  the  world  is <br/>preserved  and  therefore  is  significant  of  the  body  of  the  Great  Mother&#x2014; Nature.  Its  green  color  relates <br/>it  to  Venus  and  to  the  mystery  of  generation;  also  to  the  Islamic  faith,  whose  sacred  color  is  green  and <br/>whose  Sabbath  is  Friday,  the  day  of  Venus. <br/><br/><br/>The  Holy  Grail  is  a  symbol  both  of  the  lower  (or  irrational)  world  and  of  the  bodily  nature  of  man, <br/>because  both  are  receptacles  for  the  living  essences  of  the  superior  worlds.  Such  is  the  mystery  of  the <br/>redeeming  blood  which,  descending  into  the  condition  of  death,  overcomes  the  last  enemy  by <br/>ensouling  all  substance  with  its  own  immortality.  To  the  Christian,  whose  mystic  faith  especially <br/>emphasizes  the  love  element,  the  Holy  Grail  typifies  the  heart  in  which  continually  swirls  the  living <br/>water  of  eternal  life.  Moreover,  to  the  Christian,  the  search  for  the  Holy  Grail  is  the  search  for  the  real <br/>Self  which,  when  found,  is  the  consummation  of  the  magnum  opus. <br/><br/>The  Holy  Cup  can  be  discovered  only  by  those  who  have  raised  themselves  above  the  limitations  of <br/>sensuous  existence.  In  his  mystic  poem,  The  Vision  of  Sir  Launfal,  James  Russell  Lowell  discloses  the <br/>true  nature  of  the  Holy  Grail  by  showing  that  it  is  visible  only  to  a  certain  state  of  spiritual <br/>consciousness.  Only  upon  returning  from  the  vain  pursuit  of  haughty  ambition  did  the  aged  and <br/>broken  knight  see  in  the  transformed  leper's  cup  the  glowing  chalice  of  his  lifelong  dream.  Some <br/>writers  trace  a  similarity  between  the  Grail  legend  and  the  stories  of  the  martyred  Sun  Gods  whose <br/>blood,  descending  from  heaven  into  the  earth,  was  caught  in  the  cup  of  matter  and  liberated <br/>therefrom  by  the  initiatory  rites.  The  Holy  Grail  may  also  be  the  seed  pod  so  frequently  employed  in <br/>the  ancient  Mysteries  as  an  emblem  of  germination  and  resurrection;  and  if  the  cuplike  shape  of  the <br/>Grail  be  derived  from  the  flower,  it  signifies  the  regeneration  and  spiritualization  of  the  generative <br/>forces  in  man. <br/><br/>There  are  many  accounts  of  stone  images  which,  because  of  the  substances  entering  into  their <br/>composition  and  the  ceremonials  attendant  upon  their  construction,  were  ensouled  by  the  divinities <br/>whom  they  were  created  to  resemble.  To  such  images  were  ascribed  various  human  faculties  and <br/>powers,  such  as  speech,  thought,  and  even  motion.  While  renegade  priests  doubtless  resorted  to <br/>trickery&#x2014;an  instance  of  which  is  related  in  a  curious  apocryphal  fragment  entitled  Bel  and  the <br/>Dragon  and  supposedly  deleted  from  the  end  of  the  Book  of  Daniel&#x2014; many  of  the  phenomena <br/>recorded  in  connection  with  sanctified  statues  and  relics  can  hardly  be  explained  unless  the  work  of <br/>supernatural  agencies  be  admitted. <br/><br/>History  records  the  existence  of  stones  which,  when  struck,  threw  all  who  heard  the  sound  into  a  state <br/>of  ecstasy.  There  were  also  echoing  images  which  whispered  for  hours  after  the  room  itself  had <br/>become  silent,  and  musical  stones  productive  of  the  sweetest  harmonies.  In  recognition  of  the <br/>sanctity  which  the  Greeks  and  Latins  ascribed  to  stones,  they  placed  their  hands  upon  certain <br/>consecrated  pillars  when  taking  an  oath.  In  ancient  times  stones  played  a  part  in  determining  the  fate <br/>of  accused  persons,  for  it  was  customary  for  juries  to  reach  their  verdicts  by  dropping  pebbles  into  a <br/>bag. <br/><br/>Divination  by  stones  was  often  resorted  to  by  the  Greeks,  and  Helena  is  said  to  have  foretold  by <br/>lithomancy  the  destruction  of  Troy.  Many  popular  superstitions  about  stones  survive  the  so-called <br/>Dark  Ages.  Chief  among  these  is  the  one  concerning  the  famous  black  stone  in  the  seat  of  the <br/>coronation  chair  in  Westminster  Abbey,  which  is  declared  to  be  the  actual  rock  used  by  Jacob  as  a <br/>pillow.  The  black  stone  also  appears  several  times  in  religious  symbolism.  It  was  called  Heliogabalus, <br/>a  word  presumably  derived  from  Elagabal,  the  Syro-Phoenician  sun  god.  This  stone  was  sacred  to  the <br/>sun  and  declared  to  possess  great  and  diversified  properties.  The  black  stone  in  the  Caaba  at  Mecca  is <br/>still  revered  throughout  the  Mohammedan  world.  It  is  said  to  have  been  white  originally  and  of  such <br/>brillianq'^  that  it  could  be  seen  many  days'  journey  from  Mecca,  but  as  ages  passed  it  became <br/>blackened  by  the  tears  of  pilgrims  and  the  sins  of  the  world. <br/><br/>THE  MAGIC  OF  METALS  AND  GEMS <br/><br/>According  to  the  teachings  of  the  Mysteries,  the  rays  of  the  celestial  bodies,  striking  the  crystallizing <br/>influences  of  the  lower  world,  become  the  various  elements.  Partaking  of  the  astral  virtues  of  their <br/>source,  these  elements  neutralize  certain  unbalanced  forms  of  celestial  activity  and,  when  properly <br/><br/><br/>combined,  contribute  much  to  the  well-being  of  man.  Little  is  known  today  concerning  these  magical <br/><br/>properties,  but  the  modern  world  may  yet  find  it  profitable  to  consider  the  findings  of  the  early <br/>philosophers  who  determined  these  relationships  by  extensive  experimentation.  Out  of  such  research <br/>arose  the  practice  of  identifying  the  metals  with  the  bones  of  the  various  deities.  For  example,  the <br/>Egyptians,  according  to  Manetho,  considered  iron  to  be  the  bone  of  Mars  and  the  lodestone  the  bone <br/>of  Horus.  By  analogy,  lead  would  be  the  physical  skeleton  of  Saturn,  copper  of  Venus,  quicksilver  of <br/>Mercury,  gold  of  the  sun,  silver  of  the  moon,  and  antimony  of  the  earth.  It  is  possible  that  uranium <br/><br/><br/>EXAMPLES  OF  HERM/?;. <br/><br/><br/>From  Christie's  Disquisitions  upon  the  Painted  Greek  Vases. <br/><br/>The  Primitive  custom  of  worshiping  the  gods  in  the  form  of  heaps  of  stones  gave  place  to  the  practice  of  erecting  phaUic <br/>pillars,  or  cones,  in  their  honor.  These  columns  differed  widely  in  size  and  appearance.  Some  were  of  gigantic  proportions <br/>and  were  richly  ornamented  with  inscriptions  or  likenesses  of  the  gods  and  heroes;  others&#x2014;like  the  votive  offerings  of  the <br/>Babylonians&#x2014;were  but  a  few  inches  high,  without  ornament,  and  merely  bore  a  brief  statement  of  the  purpose  for  which <br/>they  had  been  prepared  or  a  hymn  to  the  god  of  the  temple  in  which  they  were  placed.  These  small  baked  clay  cones  were <br/>identical  in  their  symbolic  meaning  with  the  large  hermse  set  up  by  the  roadside  and  in  other  public  places.  Later  the <br/>upper  end  of  the  column  was  surmounted  by  a  human  head.  Often  two  projections,  or  tenons,  corresponding  to  shoulders <br/>were  placed,  one  on  either  side,  to  support  the  wreaths  of  flowers  adorning  the  columns.  Offerings,  usually  of  food,  were <br/>placed  near  the  hermse.  Occasionally  these  columns  were  used  to  uphold  roofs  and  were  numbered  among  the  art  objects <br/>ornamenting  the  villas  of  wealthy  Romans. <br/><br/>p.  100 <br/><br/>will  prove  to  be  the  metal  of  Uranus  and  radium  to  be  the  metal  of  Neptune. <br/><br/>The  four  Ages  of  the  Greek  mystics&#x2014; the  Golden  Age,  the  Silver  Age,  the  Bronze  Age,  and  the  Iron <br/>Age&#x2014;are  metaphoric  expressions  referring  to  the  four  major  periods  in  the  life  of  all  things.  In  the <br/>divisions  of  the  day  they  signify  dawn,  midday,  sunset,  and  midnight;  in  the  duration  of  gods,  men, <br/>and  universes,  they  denote  the  periods  of  birth,  growth,  maturity,  and  decay.  The  Greek  Ages  also <br/>bear  a  close  correspondence  to  the  four  Yugas  of  the  Hindus:  Krita-Yuga,  Treta-Yuga,  Dvapara- <br/>Yuga,  and  Kali-Yuga.  Their  method  of  calculation  is  described  by  UUamudeian  as  follows:  &quot;In  each  of <br/>the  12  signs  there  are  1800  minutes;  multiply  this  number  by  12  you  have  21600;  e.g.  1800  X <br/>12=21600.  Multiply  this  21600  by  80  and  it  will  give  1,728,000,  which  is  the  duration  of  the  first  age, <br/>called  Krita-Yuga.  If  the  same  number  be  multiplied  by  60,  it  will  give  1,296,000,  the  years  of  the <br/>second  age,  Treta-Yuga.  The  same  number  multiplied  by  40  gives  864,000,  the  length  of  the  third <br/><br/><br/>age,  Dvapara-Yuga.  The  same  multiplied  by  20  gives  432,000,  the  fourth  age,  Kali-Yuga.&quot;  (It  will  be <br/>noted  that  these  multipliers  decrease  in  inverse  ratio  to  the  Pjlihagorean  tetractys:  1,  2,  3,  and  4.) <br/><br/>H.  P.  Blavatsky  declares  that  Orpheus  taught  his  followers  how  to  affect  a  whole  audience  by  means  of <br/>a  lodestone,  and  that  Pjlihagoras  paid  particular  attention  to  the  color  and  nature  of  precious  stones. <br/>She  adds:  &quot;The  Buddhists  assert  that  the  sapphire  produces  peace  of  mind,  equanimity,  and  chases  all <br/>evil  thoughts  by  establishing  a  healthy  circulation  in  man.  So  does  an  electric  battery,  with  its  well- <br/>directed  fluid,  say  our  electricians.  'The  sapphire,'  say  the  Buddhists,  'will  open  barred  doors  and <br/>dwellings  (for  the  spirit  of  man);  it  produces  a  desire  for  prayer,  and  brings  with  it  more  peace  than <br/>any  other  gem;  but  he  who  would  wear  it  must  lead  a  pure  and  holy  life.'&quot;  (See  Isis  Unveiled.) <br/><br/>Mythology  abounds  with  accounts  of  magical  rings  and  talismanic  jewels.  In  the  second  book  of  his <br/>Republic,  Plato  describes  a  ring  which,  when  the  collet  was  turned  in  ward,  rendered  its  wearer <br/>invisible.  With  this  Gyges,  the  shepherd,  secured  for  himself  the  throne  of  Lydia.  Josephus  also <br/>describes  magical  rings  designed  by  Moses  and  King  Solomon,  and  Aristotle  mentions  one  which <br/>brought  love  and  honor  to  its  possessor.  In  his  chapter  dealing  with  the  subject,  Henry  Cornelius <br/>Agrippa  not  only  mentions  the  same  rings,  but  states,  upon  the  authority  of  Philostratus  Jarchus,  that <br/>Apollonius  of  Tyana  extended  his  life  to  over  20  years  with  the  aid  of  seven  magical  rings  presented  to <br/>him  by  an  East  Indian  prince.  Each  of  these  seven  rings  was  set  with  a  gem  partaking  of  the  nature  of <br/>one  of  the  seven  ruling  planets  of  the  week,  and  by  daily  changing  the  rings  Apollonius  protected <br/>himself  against  sickness  and  death  by  the  intervention  of  the  planetary  influences.  The  philosopher <br/>also  instructed  his  disciples  in  the  virtues  of  these  talismanic  jewels,  considering  such  information  to <br/>be  indispensable  to  the  theurgist.  Agrippa  describes  the  preparation  of  magical  rings  as  follows: <br/>&quot;When  any  Star  [planet]  ascends  fortunately,  with  the  fortunate  aspect  or  conjunction  of  the  Moon, <br/>we  must  take  a  stone  and  herb  that  is  under  that  Star,  and  make  a  ring  of  the  metal  that  is  suitable  to <br/>this  Star,  and  in  it  fasten  the  stone,  putting  the  herb  or  root  under  it-not  omitting  the  inscriptions  of <br/>images,  names,  and  characters,  as  also  the  proper  suffamigations.&quot;  (See  Three  Books  of  Occult <br/>Philosophy.) <br/><br/>The  ring  has  long  been  regarded  as  the  symbol  of  attainment,  perfection,  and  immortality-the  last <br/>because  the  circlet  of  precious  metal  had  neither  beginning  nor  end.  In  the  Mysteries,  rings  chased  to <br/>resemble  a  serpent  with  its  tail  in  its  mouth  were  worn  by  the  initiates  as  material  evidence  of  the <br/>position  reached  by  them  in  the  order.  Signet  rings,  engraved  with  certain  secret  emblems,  were  worn <br/>by  the  hierophants,  and  it  was  not  uncommon  for  a  messenger  to  prove  that  he  was  the  official <br/>representative  of  a  prince  or  other  dignitary  by  bringing  with  his  message  either  an  impression  from <br/>his  master's  ring  or  the  signet  itself.  The  wedding  ring  originally  was  intended  to  imply  that  in  the <br/>nature  of  the  one  who  wore  it  the  state  of  equilibrium  and  completion  had  been  attained.  This  plain <br/>band  of  gold  therefore  bore  witness  of  the  union  of  the  Higher  Self  (God)  with  the  lower  self  (Nature) <br/>and  the  ceremony  consummating  this  indissoluble  blending  of  Divinity  and  humanity  in  the  one <br/>nature  of  the  initiated  mystic  constituted  the  hermetic  marriage  of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>In  describing  the  regalia  of  a  magician,  Eliphas  Levi  declares  that  on  Sunday  (the  day  of  the  sun)  he <br/>should  carry  in  his  right  hand  a  golden  wand,  set  with  a  ruby  or  chrysolite;  on  Monday  (the  day  of  the <br/>moon)  he  should  wear  a  collar  of  three  strands  consisting  of  pearls,  crystals,  and  selenites;  on <br/>Tuesday  (the  day  of  Mars)  he  should  carry  a  wand  of  magnetized  steel  and  a  ring  of  the  same  metal <br/>set  with  an  amethyst,  on  Wednesday  (the  day  of  Mercury)  he  should  wear  a  necklace  of  pearls  or  glass <br/>beads  containing  mercury,  and  a  ring  set  with  an  agate;  on  Thursday  (the  day  of  Jupiter)  he  should <br/>carry  a  wand  of  glass  or  resin  and  wear  a  ring  set  with  an  emerald  or  a  sapphire;  on  Friday  (the  day  of <br/>Venus)  he  should  carry  a  wand  of  polished  copper  and  wear  a  ring  set  with  a  turquoise  and  a  crown  or <br/>diadem  decorated  with  lapis  lazuli  and  beryl;  and  on  Saturday  (the  day  of  Saturn)  he  should  carry  a <br/>wand  ornamented  with  onyx  stone  and  wear  a  ring  set  with  onyx  and  a  chain  about  the  neck  formed <br/>of  lead.  (See  The  Magical  Ritiial  of  the  Sanctum  Regnum.) <br/><br/><br/>Paracelsus,  Agrippa,  Kircher,  Lilly,  and  numerous  other  magicians  and  astrologers  have  tabulated  the <br/><br/>gems  and  stones  corresponding  to  the  various  planets  and  zodiacal  signs.  The  following  list  has  been <br/>compiled  from  their  writings.  To  the  sun  is  assigned  the  carbuncle,  ruby,  garnet &#x2014; especially  the <br/>pyrope~and  other  fiery  stones,  sometimes  the  diamond;  to  the  moon,  the  pearl,  selenite,  and  other <br/>forms  of  crystal;  to  Saturn,  the  onyx,  jasper,  topaz,  and  sometimes  the  lapis  lazuli;  to  Jupiter,  the <br/>sapphire,  emerald,  and  marble;  to  Mars,  the  amethyst,  hyacinth,  lodestone,  sometimes  the  diamond; <br/>to  Venus,  the  turquoise,  beryl,  emerald,  and  sometimes  the  pearl,  alabaster,  coral,  and  carnelian;  to <br/>Mercury,  the  chrysolite,  agate,  and  variegated  marble. <br/><br/>To  the  zodiac  the  same  authorities  assigned  the  following  gems  and  stones:  To  Aries  the  sardonyx, <br/>bloodstone,  amethyst,  and  diamond;  to  Taurus  the  carnelian,  turquoise,  hyacinth,  sapphire,  moss <br/>agate,  and  emerald;  to  Gemini  the  topaz,  agate,  chrysoprase,  crystal,  and  aquamarine;  to  Cancer  the <br/>topaz,  chalcedony,  black  onyx,  moonstone,  pearl,  cat's-eye,  crystal,  and  sometimes  the  emerald;  to <br/>Leo  the  jasper,  sardonyx,  beryl,  ruby,  chrysolite,  amber,  tourmaline,  sometimes  the  diamond;  to  Virgo <br/>the  emerald,  camelian,  jade,  chrysolite,  and  sometimes  the  pink  jasper  and  hyacinth;  to  Libra  the <br/>beryl,  sardius,  coral,  lapis  lazuli,  opal,  and  sometimes  the  diamond;  to  Scorpio  the  amethyst,  beryl, <br/>sardonyx,  aquamarine,  carbuncle,  lodestone,  topaz,  and  malachite;  to  Sagittarius  die  hyacinth,  topaz, <br/>chrysolite,  emerald,  carbuncle,  and  turquoise;  to  Capricorn  the  chrysoprase,  ruby,  malachite,  black <br/>onyx,  white  onyx,  jet,  and  moonstone;  to  Aquarius  the  crystal,  sapphire,  garnet,  zircon,  and  opal;  to <br/>Pisces  the  sapphire,  jasper,  chrysolite,  moonstone,  and  amethyst <br/><br/>Both  the  magic  mirror  and  the  crystal  ball  are  symbols  little  understood.  Woe  to  that  benighted <br/>mortal  who  accepts  literally  the  stories  circulated  concerning  them!  He  will  discover&#x2014;often  at  the  cost <br/>of  sanity  and  health&#x2014;that  sorcery  and  philosophy,  while  often  confused,  have  nothing  in  common. <br/>The  Persian  Magi  carried  mirrors  as  an  emblem  of  the  material  sphere  which  reflects  Divinity  from  its <br/>every  part.  The  crystal  ball,  long  misused  as  a  medium  for  the  cultivation  of  psychical  powers,  is  a <br/>threefold  symbol:  (i)  it  signifies  the  crystalline  Universal  Egg  in  whose  transparent  depths  creation <br/>exists;  (2)  it  is  a  proper  figure  of  Deity  previous  to  Its  immersion  in  matter;  (3)  it  signifies  the  setheric <br/>sphere  of  the  world  in  whose  translucent  essences  is  impressed  and  preserved  the  perfect  image  of  all <br/>terrestrial  activity. <br/><br/>Meteors,  or  rocks  from  heaven,  were  considered  tokens  of  divine  favor  and  enshrined  as  evidence  of  a <br/>pact  between  the  gods  and  the  community  in  which  they  fell.  Curiously  marked  or  chipped  natural <br/>stones  are  occasionally  found.  In  China  there  is  a  slab  of  marble  the  grain  of  which  forms  a  perfect <br/>likeness  of  the  Chinese  dragon.  The  Oberammergau  stone,  chipped  by  Nature  into  a  close <br/>resemblance  to  the  popular  conception  of  the  face  of  Christ,  is  so  remarkable  that  even  the  crowned <br/>heads  of  Europe  requested  the  privilege  of  beholding  it.  Stones  of  such  nature  were  held  in  the  highest <br/>esteem  among  primitive  peoples  and  even  today  exert  a  wide  influence  upon  the  religiously-minded. <br/><br/><br/>THE  PYTHAGOREAN  SIGNET  RING. <br/><br/><br/>From  Cartari's  Imagini  degli  Dei  degli  Antichi. <br/><br/>The  number  five  was  peculiarly  associated  by  the  Pythagoreans  with  the  art  of  healing,  and  the  pentagram,  or  five-pointed <br/>star,  was  to  them  the  symbol  of  health.  The  above  figure  represents  a  magical  ring  set  with  a  talismanic  gem  bearing  the <br/>pentalpha,  or  star  formed  by  five  different  positions  of  the  Greek  Alpha.  On  this  subject  Mackey  writes:  &quot;The  disciples  of <br/>Pythagoras,  who  were  indeed  its  real  inventors,  placed  within  each  of  its  interior  angles  one  of  the  letters  of  the  Greek <br/>word  YFEIA,  or  the  Latin  one  SALUS,  both  of  which  signify  health;  and  thus  it  was  made  the  talisman  of  health.  They <br/>placed  it  at  the  beginning  of  their  epistles  as  a  greeting  to  invoke  a  secure  health  to  their  correspondent.  But  its  use  was <br/>not  confined  to  the  disciples  of  Pythagoras.  As  a  talisman,  it  was  employed  all  over  the  East  as  a  charm  to  resist  evil <br/>spirits.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>p.  101 <br/><br/><br/>CEREMONIAL  MAGIC  AND  SORCERY <br/><br/>CEREMONIAL  magic  is  the  ancient  art  of  invoking  and  controlling  spirits  by  a  scientific  application <br/>of  certain  formulge.  A  magician,  enveloped  in  sanctified  vestments  and  carrying  a  wand  inscribed  with <br/>hieroglyphic  figures,  could  by  the  power  vested  in  certain  words  and  symbols  control  the  invisible <br/>inhabitants  of  the  elements  and  of  the  astral  world.  While  the  elaborate  ceremonial  magic  of  antiquity <br/>was  not  necessarily  evil,  there  arose  from  its  perversion  several  false  schools  of  sorcery,  or  black <br/>magic. <br/><br/>Egypt,  a  great  center  of  learning  and  the  birthplace  of  many  arts  and  sciences,  furnished  an  ideal <br/>environment  for  transcendental  experimentation.  Here  the  black  magicians  of  Atlantis  continued  to <br/>exercise  their  superhuman  powers  until  they  had  completely  undermined  and  corrupted  the  morals  of <br/>the  primitive  Mysteries.  By  establishing  a  sacerdotal  caste  they  usurped  the  position  formerly <br/>occupied  by  the  initiates,  and  seized  the  reins  of  spiritual  government.  Thus  black  magic  dictated  the <br/>state  religion  and  paralyzed  the  intellectual  and  spiritual  activities  of  the  individual  by  demanding  his <br/>complete  and  unhesitating  acquiescence  in  the  dogma  formulated  by  the  priestcraft.  The  Pharaoh <br/>became  a  puppet  in  the  hands  of  the  Scarlet  Council&#x2014;a  committee  of  arch-sorcerers  elevated  to  power <br/>by  the  priesthood. <br/><br/>These  sorcerers  then  began  the  systematic  destruction  of  all  keys  to  the  ancient  wisdom,  so  that  none <br/>might  have  access  to  the  knowledge  necessary  to  reach  adeptship  without  first  becoming  one  of  their <br/>order.  They  mutilated  the  rituals  of  the  Mysteries  while  professing  to  preserve  them,  so  that  even <br/>though  the  neophyte  passed  through  the  degrees  he  could  not  secure  the  knowledge  to  which  he  was <br/>entitled.  Idolatry  was  introduced  by  encouraging  the  worship  of  the  images  which  in  the  beginning <br/>the  wise  had  erected  solely  as  symbols  for  study  and  meditation.  False  interpretations  were  given  to <br/>the  emblems  and  figures  of  the  Mysteries,  and  elaborate  theologies  were  created  to  confuse  the  minds <br/>of  their  devotees.  The  masses,  deprived  of  their  birthright  of  understanding  and  groveling  in <br/>ignorance,  eventually  became  the  abject  slaves  of  the  spiritual  impostors.  Superstition  universally <br/>prevailed  and  the  black  magicians  completely  dominated  national  affairs,  with  the  result  that <br/>humanity  still  suffers  from  the  sophistries  of  the  priestcrafts  of  Atlantis  and  Egypt. <br/><br/>Fully  convinced  that  their  Scriptures  sanctioned  it,  numerous  mediaeval  Qabbalists  devoted  their  lives <br/>to  the  practice  of  ceremonial  magic.  The  transcendentalism  of  the  Qabbalists  is  founded  upon  the <br/>ancient  and  magical  formula  of  King  Solomon,  who  has  long  been  considered  by  the  Jews  as  the <br/>prince  of  ceremonial  magicians. <br/><br/>Among  the  Qabbalists  of  the  Middle  Ages  were  a  great  number  of  black  magicians  who  strayed  from <br/>the  noble  concepts  of  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  and  became  enmeshed  in  demonism  and  witchcraft.  They <br/>sought  to  substitute  magic  mirrors,  consecrated  daggers,  and  circles  spread  around  posts  of  coffin <br/>nails,  for  the  living  of  that  virtuous  life  which,  without  the  assistance  of  complicated  rituals  or <br/>submundane  creatures,  unfailingly  brings  man  to  the  state  of  true  individual  completion. <br/><br/>Those  who  sought  to  control  elemental  spirits  through  ceremonial  magic  did  so  largely  with  the  hope <br/>of  securing  from  the  invisible  worlds  either  rare  knowledge  or  supernatural  power.  The  little  red <br/>demon  of  Napoleon  Bonaparte  and  the  infamous  oracular  heads  of  de  Medici  are  examples  of  the <br/>disastrous  results  of  permitting  elemental  beings  to  dictate  the  course  of  human  procedure.  While  the <br/>learned  and  godlike  daemon  of  Socrates  seems  to  have  been  an  exception,  this  really  proves  that  the <br/>intellectual  and  moral  status  of  the  magician  has  much  to  do  with  the  type  of  elemental  he  is  capable <br/>of  invoking.  But  even  the  daemon  of  Socrates  deserted  the  philosopher  when  the  sentence  of  death <br/>was  passed. <br/><br/><br/>Transcendentalism  and  all  forms  of  phenomenalistic  magic  are  but  blind  alleys&#x2014;outgrowths  of <br/><br/>Atlantean  sorcery;  and  those  who  forsake  the  straight  path  of  philosophy  to  wander  therein  almost <br/>invariably  fall  victims  to  their  imprudence.  Man,  incapable  of  controlling  his  own  appetites,  is  not <br/>equal  to  the  task  of  governing  the  fiery  and  tempestuous  elemental  spirits. <br/><br/>Many  a  magician  has  lost  his  life  as  the  result  of  opening  a  way  whereby  submundane  creatures  could <br/>become  active  participants  in  his  affairs.  When  Eliphas  Levi  invoked  the  spirit  of  Apollonius  of  Tyana, <br/>what  did  he  hope  to  accomplish?  Is  the  gratification  of  curiosity  a  motive  sufficient  to  warrant  the <br/>devotion  of  an  entire  lifetime  to  a  dangerous  and  unprofitable  pursuit?  If  the  living  Apollonius <br/>refused  to  divulge  his  secrets  to  the  profane,  is  there  any  probability  that  after  death  he  would <br/>disclose  them  to  the  curious-minded?  Levi  himself  did  not  dare  to  assert  that  the  specter  which <br/>appeared  to  him  was  actually  the  great  philosopher,  for  Levi  realized  only  too  well  the  proclivity  of <br/>elementals  to  impersonate  those  who  have  passed  on.  The  majority  of  modem  mediumistic <br/>apparitions  are  but  elemental  creatures  masquerading  through  bodies  composed  of  thought <br/>substance  supplied  by  the  very  persons  desiring  to  behold  these  wraiths  of  decarnate  beings. <br/><br/>THE  THEORY  AND  PRACTICE  OF  BLACK  MAGIC <br/><br/>Some  understanding  of  the  intricate  theory  and  practice  of  ceremonial  magic  may  be  derived  from  a <br/>brief  consideration  of  its  underlying  premises. <br/><br/>First.  The  visible  universe  has  an  invisible  counterpart,  the  higher  planes  of  which  are  peopled  by <br/>good  and  beautiful  spirits;  the  lower  planes,  dark  and  foreboding,  are  the  habitation  of  evil  spirits  and <br/>demons  under  the  leadership  of  the  Fallen  Angel  and  his  ten  Princes. <br/><br/>Second.  By  means  of  the  secret  processes  of  ceremonial  magic  it  is  possible  to  contact  these  invisible <br/>creatures  and  gain  their  help  in  some  human  undertaking.  Good  spirits  willingly  lend  their  assistance <br/>to  any  worthy  enterprise,  but  the  evil  spirits  serve  only  those  who  live  to  pervert  and  destroy. <br/><br/>Third.  It  is  possible  to  make  contracts  with  spirits  whereby  the  magician  becomes  for  a  stipulated <br/>time  the  master  of  an  elemental  being. <br/><br/>Fourth.  True  black  magic  is  performed  with  the  aid  of  a  demoniacal  spirit,  who  serves  the  sorcerer  for <br/>the  length  of  his  earthly  life,  with  the  understanding  that  after  death  the  magician  shall  become  the <br/>servant  of  his  own  demon.  For  this  reason  a  black  magician  will  go  to  inconceivable  ends  to  prolong <br/>his  physical  life,  since  there  is  nothing  for  him  beyond  the  grave. <br/><br/>The  most  dangerous  form  of  black  magic  is  the  scientific  perversion  of  occult  power  for  the <br/>gratification  of  personal  desire.  Its  less  complex  and  more  universal  form  is  human  selfishness,  for <br/>selfishness  is  the  fundamental  cause  of  all  worldly  evil.  A  man  will  barter  his  eternal  soul  for  temporal <br/>power,  and  down  through  the  ages  a  mysterious  process  has  been  evolved  which  actually  enables  him <br/>to  make  this  exchange.  In  its  various  branches  the  black  art  includes  nearly  all  forms  of  ceremonial <br/>magic,  necromanqr,  witchcraft,  sorcery,  and  vampirism.  Under  the  same  general  heading  are  also <br/>included  mesmerism  and  hypnotism,  except  when  used  solely  for  medical  purposes,  and  even  then <br/>there  is  an  element  of  risk  for  all  concerned. <br/><br/>Though  the  demonism  of  the  Middle  Ages  seems  to  have  disappeared,  there  is  abundant  evidence  that <br/>in  many  forms  of  modern  thought&#x2014;especially  the  so-called  &quot;prosperity&quot;  psychology,  &quot;willpower- <br/>building&quot;  metaphysics,  and  systems  of  &quot;high-pressure&quot;  salesmanship&#x2014; <br/><br/><br/>BAPHOMET,  THE  GOAT  OF  MENDES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Levi's  Transcendental  Magic. <br/><br/>The  practice  of  magic&#x2014;either  white  or  black&#x2014; depends  upon  the  abihty  of  the  adept  to  control  the  universal  life  force&#x2014;that <br/>which  Eliphas  Levi  calls  the  great  magical  agent  or  the  astral  light.  By  the  manipulation  of  this  fluidic  essence  the <br/>phenomena  of  transcendentalism  are  produced.  The  famous  hermaphroditic  Goat  of  Mendes  was  a  composite  creature <br/>formulated  to  symbolize  this  astral  light.  It  is  identical  with  Baphomet  the  mystic  pantheos  of  those  disciples  of <br/>ceremonial  magic,  the  Templars,  who  probably  obtained  it  from  the  Arabians. <br/><br/>p.  102 <br/><br/>black  magic  has  merely  passed  through  a  metamorphosis,  and  although  its  name  be  changed  its <br/>nature  remains  the  same. <br/><br/>A  well-known  magician  of  the  Middle  Ages  was  Dr.  Johannes  Faustus,  more  commonly  known  as  Dr. <br/>Faust.  By  a  study  of  magical  writings  he  was  enabled  to  bind  to  his  service  an  elemental  who  served <br/>him  for  many  years  in  various  capacities.  Strange  legends  are  told  concerning  the  magical  powers <br/>possessed  by  Dr.  Faust.  Upon  one  occasion  the  philosopher,  being  apparently  in  a  playful  mood, <br/>threw  his  mantle  over  a  number  of  eggs  in  a  market-woman's  basket,  causing  them  to  hatch  instantly. <br/>At  another  time,  having  fallen  overboard  from  a  small  boat,  he  was  picked  up  and  returned  to  the <br/>craft  v^th  his  clothes  still  dry.  But,  like  nearly  all  other  magicians.  Dr.  Faust  came  at  length  to  disaster; <br/>he  was  found  one  morning  with  a  knife  in  his  back,  and  it  was  commonly  believed  that  his  familiar <br/>spirit  had  murdered  him.  Although  Goethe's  Dr.  Faust  is  generally  regarded  as  merely  a  fictional <br/>character,  this  old  magician  actually  lived  during  the  sixteenth  century.  Dr.  Faust  wrote  a  book <br/>describing  his  experiences  with  spirits,  a  section  of  which  is  reprinted  below.  (Dr.  Faust  must  not  be <br/>confused  with  Johann  Fust,  the  printer.) <br/><br/><br/>EXTRACT  FROM  THE  BOOK  OF  DR.  FAUST,  WITTENBERG,  1524 <br/><br/><br/>(An  abridged  translation  from  the  original  German  of  a  book  ordered  destroyed.) <br/><br/>&quot;From  my  youth  I  followed  art  and  science  and  was  tireless  in  my  reading  of  books.  Among  those <br/>which  came  to  my  hand  was  a  volume  containing  all  kinds  of  invocations  and  magical  formulae.  In <br/>this  book  I  discovered  information  to  the  effect  that  a  spirit,  whether  he  be  of  the  fire,  the  water,  the <br/>earth  or  the  air,  can  be  compelled  to  do  the  will  of  a  magician  capable  of  controlling  him.  I  also <br/>discovered  that  according  as  one  spirit  has  more  power  than  another,  each  is  adapted  for  a  different <br/>operation  and  each  is  capable  of  producing  certain  supernatural  effects. <br/><br/>&quot;After  reading  this  wonderful  book,  I  made  several  experiments,  desiring  to  rest  the  accuracy  of  the <br/>statements  made  therein.  At  first  I  had  little  faith  that  what  was  promised  would  take  place.  But  at  the <br/>very  first  invocation  which  I  attempted  a  mighty  spirit  manifested  to  me,  desiring  to  know  why  I  had <br/>invoked  him.  His  coming  so  amazed  me  that  I  scarcely  knew  what  to  say,  but  finally  asked  him  if  he <br/>would  serve  me  in  my  magical  investigations.  He  replied  that  if  certain  conditions  were  agreed  upon <br/>he  would.  The  conditions  were  that  I  should  make  a  pact  with  him.  This  I  did  not  desire  to  do,  but  as <br/>in  my  ignorance  I  had  not  protected  myself  with  a  circle  and  was  actually  at  the  merqr  of  the  spirit,  I <br/>did  not  dare  to  refuse  his  request  and  resigned  myself  to  the  inevitable,  considering  it  wisest  to  turn <br/>my  mantle  according  to  the  wind. <br/><br/>&quot;I  then  told  him  that  if  he  would  be  serviceable  to  me  according  to  my  desires  and  needs  for  a  certain <br/>length  of  time,  I  would  sign  myself  over  to  him.  After  the  pact  had  been  arranged,  this  mighty  spirit, <br/>whose  name  was  Asteroth,  introduced  me  to  another  spirit  by  the  name  of  Marbuel,  who  was <br/>appointed  to  be  my  servant.  I  questioned  Marbuel  as  to  his  suitability  for  my  needs.  I  asked  him  how <br/>quick  he  was,  and  he  answered,  'As  swift  as  the  winds.'  This  did  not  satisfy  me,  so  I  replied,  'You <br/>cannot  become  my  servant.  Go  again  whence  you  have  come.'  Soon  another  spirit  manifested  itself, <br/>whose  name  was  Aniguel.  Upon  asking  him  the  same  question  he  answered  that  he  was  swift  as  a  bird <br/>in  the  air.  I  said,  'You  are  still  too  slow  for  me.  Go  whence  you  came.'  In  the  same  moment  another <br/>spirit  by  the  name  of  Aciel  manifested  himself.  For  the  third  time  I  asked  my  question  and  he <br/>answered,  'I  am  as  swift  as  human  thought.'  'You  shall  serve  me,'  I  replied.  This  spirit  was  faithful  for <br/>a  long  time,  but  to  tell  you  how  he  served  me  is  not  possible  in  a  document  of  this  length  and  I  will <br/>here  only  indicate  how  spirits  are  to  be  invoked  and  how  the  circles  for  protection  are  to  be  prepared. <br/>There  are  many  kinds  of  spirits  which  will  permit  themselves  to  be  invoked  by  man  and  become  his <br/>servant.  Of  these  I  will  list  a  few: <br/><br/>&quot;Aciel:  The  mightiest  among  those  who  serve  men.  He  manifests  in  pleasing  human  form  about  three <br/>feet  high.  He  must  be  invoked  three  times  before  he  will  come  forth  into  the  circle  prepared  for  him. <br/>He  will  furnish  riches  and  will  instantly  fetch  things  from  a  great  distance,  according  to  the  will  of  the <br/>magician.  He  is  as  swift  as  human  thought. <br/><br/>&quot;Aniguel:  Serviceable  and  most  useful,  and  comes  in  the  form  of  a  ten-year-old  boy.  He  must  be <br/>invoked  three  times.  His  special  power  is  to  discover  treasures  and  minerals  hidden  in  the  ground, <br/>which  he  will  furnish  to  the  magician. <br/><br/>&quot;Marbuel:  A  true  lord  of  the  mountains  and  swift  as  a  bird  on  the  wing.  He  is  an  opposing  and <br/>troublesome  spirit,  hard  to  control.  You  must  invoke  him  four  times.  He  appears  in  the  person  of <br/>Mars  [a  warrior  in  heavy  armor].  He  will  furnish  the  magician  those  things  which  grow  above  and <br/>under  the  earth.  He  is  particularly  the  lord  of  the  spring-root.  [The  spring-root  is  a  mysterious  herb, <br/>possibly  of  a  reddish  color,  which  medigeval  magicians  asserted  had  the  property  of  drawing  forth  or <br/>opening  anything  it  touched.  If  placed  against  a  locked  door,  it  would  open  the  door.  The  Hermetists <br/>believed  that  the  red-capped  woodpecker  was  specially  endowed  with  the  faculty  of  discovering <br/>spring-root,  so  they  followed  this  bird  to  its  nest,  and  then  stopped  up  the  hole  in  the  tree  where  its <br/><br/><br/>young  were.  The  red-crested  woodpecker  went  at  once  in  quest  of  the  spring-root,  and,  discovering  it, <br/>brought  it  to  the  tree.  It  immediately  drew  forth  the  stopper  from  the  entrance  to  the  nest.  The <br/>magician  then  secured  the  root  from  the  bird.  It  was  also  asserted  that  because  of  its  structure,  the <br/>etheric  body  of  the  spring-root  was  utilized  as  a  vehicle  of  expression  by  certain  elemental  spirits <br/>which  manifested  through  the  proclivity  of  drawing  out  or  opening  things.] <br/><br/>&quot;Aciebel:  A  mighty  ruler  of  the  sea,  controlling  things  both  upon  and  under  the  water.  He  furnishes <br/>things  lost  or  sunk  in  rivers,  lakes,  and  oceans,  such  as  sunken  ships  and  treasures.  The  more  sharply <br/>you  invoke  him,  the  swifter  he  is  upon  his  errands. <br/><br/>&quot;Machiel:  Comes  in  the  form  of  a  beautiful  maiden  and  by  her  aid  the  magician  is  raised  to  honor  and <br/>dignity.  She  makes  those  she  serves  worthy  and  noble,  gracious  and  kindly,  and  assists  in  all  matters <br/>of  litigation  and  justice.  She  will  not  come  unless  invoked  twice. <br/><br/>&quot;Baruel:  The  master  of  all  arts.  He  manifests  as  a  master  workman  and  comes  wearing  an  apron.  He <br/>can  teach  a  magician  more  in  a  moment  than  all  the  master  workmen  of  the  world  combined  could <br/>accomplish  in  twenty  years.  He  must  be  invoked  three  times. <br/><br/>&quot;These  are  the  spirits  most  serviceable  to  man,  but  there  are  numerous  others  which,  for  lack  of  space, <br/>I  am  unable  to  describe.  Now,  if  you  desire  the  aid  of  the  spirit  to  get  this  or  that,  then  you  must  first <br/>draw  the  sign  of  the  spirit  whom  you  desire  to  invoke.  The  drawing  must  be  made  just  in  front  of  a <br/>circle  made  before  sunrise,  in  which  you  and  your  assistants  will  stand.  If  you  desire  financial <br/>assistance,  then  you  must  invoke  the  spirit  AczeZ.  Draw  his  sign  in  front  of  the  circle.  If  you  need  other <br/>things,  then  draw  the  sign  of  the  spirit  capable  of  furnishing  them.  On  the  place  where  you  intend  to <br/>make  the  circle,  you  must  first  draw  a  great  cross  with  a  large  sword  with  which  no  one  ever  has  been <br/>hurt.  Then  you  must  make  three  concentric  circles.  The  innermost  circle  is  made  of  a <br/><br/><br/>Eliphas  Levi  describes  the  preparation  of  a  magical  sword  in  substance  as  follows:  The  steel  blade  should  be  forged  in  the <br/>hour  of  Mars,  with  new  tools.  The  pommel  should  be  of  hollow  silver  containing  quicksilver,  and  the  symbols  of  Mercury <br/>and  the  moon  and  the  signatures  of  Gabriel  and  Samael  should  be  engraved  upon  it.  The  hilt  should  be  encased  with  tin, <br/>with  the  symbol  of  Jupiter  and  the  signature  of  Michael  engraved  upon  it.  A  copper  triangle  should  extend  from  the  hilt <br/>along  the  blade  a  short  distance  on  each  side:  these  should  bear  the  symbols  of  Mercury  and  Venus.  Five  Sephiroth  should <br/>be  engraved  upon  the  handle,  as  shown.  The  blade  itself  should  have  the  word  Malchut  upon  one  side  and  Quis  ut  Deus <br/>upon  the  other.  The  sword  should  be  consecrated  on  Sunday. <br/><br/><br/>A  MAGICAL  SWORD. <br/><br/><br/>From  Levi's  The  Magical  Ritual. <br/><br/><br/>A  MAGIC  CIRCLE. <br/><br/><br/>From  The  Complete  Book  of  Magic  Science  (unpublished). <br/><br/>The  above  figure  is  a  complete  and  faithful  representation  of  a  magic  circle  as  designed  by  mediaeval  conjurers  for  the <br/>invocation  of  spirits.  The  magician  accompanied  by  his  assistant  takes  his  place  at  the  point  formed  by  the  crossing  of  the <br/>central  lines  marked  MAGISTER.  The  words  about  the  circle  are  the  names  of  the  invisible  intelligences,  and  the  small <br/>crosses  mark  points  at  which  certain  prayers  and  invocations  are  recited.  The  small  circle  outside  is  prepared  for  the  spirit <br/>to  be  invoked,  and  while  in  use  has  the  signature  of  the  desired  intelligence  traced  within  the  triangle. <br/><br/>p.  103 <br/><br/>long  narrow  strip  of  virgin  parchment  and  must  be  hung  upon  twelve  crosses  made  of  the  wood  of <br/>cross-thorn.  Upon  the  parchment  you  must  write  the  names  and  symbols  according  to  the  figure <br/>which  follows.  Outside  this  first  circle  make  the  second  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;First  secure  a  thread  of  red  silk  that  has  been  spun  or  twisted  to  the  left  instead  of  the  right.  Then <br/>place  in  the  ground  twelve  crosses  made  of  laurel  leaves,  and  also  prepare  a  long  strip  of  new  white <br/>paper.  Write  with  an  unused  pen  the  characters  and  symbols  as  seen  on  the  second  circle.  Wind  this <br/>latter  strip  of  paper  around  v^th  the  red  silken  thread  and  pin  them  upon  the  twelve  crosses  of  laurel <br/>leaves.  Outside  this  second  circle  make  a  third  one  which  is  also  of  virgin  parchment  and  pinned  upon <br/>twelve  crosses  of  consecrated  palm.  When  you  have  made  these  three  circles,  retire  into  them  until  at <br/>last  you  stand  in  the  center  upon  a  pentagram  drawn  in  the  midst  of  the  great  cross  first  drawn.  Now, <br/>to  insure  success,  do  everything  according  to  the  description,  and  when  you  have  read  off  the  sacred <br/>invocation  pronounce  the  name  of  the  spirit  which  you  desire  to  appear.  It  is  essential  that  you <br/>pronounce  the  name  very  distinctly.  You  must  also  note  the  day  and  the  hour,  for  each  spirit  can  only <br/>be  invoked  at  certain  times.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>While  the  black  magician  at  the  time  of  signing  his  pact  with  the  elemental  demon  maybe  fully <br/>convinced  that  he  is  strong  enough  to  control  indefinitely  the  powers  placed  at  his  disposal,  he  is <br/>speedily  undeceived.  Before  many  years  elapse  he  must  turn  all  his  energies  to  the  problem  of  self- <br/>preservation.  A  world  of  horrors  to  which  he  has  attuned  himself  by  his  own  covetousness  looms <br/>nearer  every  day,  until  he  exists  upon  the  edge  of  a  seething  maelstrom,  expecting  momentarily  to  be <br/>sucked  down  into  its  turbid  depths.  Afraid  to  die&#x2014;because  he  will  become  the  servant  of  his  own <br/>demon&#x2014;the  magician  commits  crime  after  crime  to  prolong  his  wretched  earthly  existence.  Realizing <br/>that  life  is  maintained  by  the  aid  of  a  mysterious  universal  life  force  which  is  the  common  property  of <br/>all  creatures,  the  black  magician  often  becomes  an  occult  vampire,  stealing  this  energy  from  others. <br/>According  to  medieeval  superstition,  black  magicians  turned  themselves  into  werewolves  and  roamed <br/>the  earth  at  night,  attacking  defenseless  victims  for  the  life  force  contained  in  their  blood. <br/><br/>MODUS  OPERANDI  FOR  THE  INVOCATION  OF  SPIRITS <br/><br/>The  following  condensed  extract  from  an  ancient  manuscript  is  reproduced  herewith  as <br/>representative  of  the  ritualism  of  ceremonial  magic.  The  extract  is  from  The  Complete  Book  of  Magic <br/>Science,  an  unpublished  manuscript  (original  in  the  British  Museum),  with  pentacles  in  colors, <br/>mentioned  by  Francis  Barrett  in  his  Magus. <br/><br/>&quot;Opening  Prayer <br/><br/>&quot;Omnipotent  and  Eternal  God  who  hath  ordained  the  whole  creation  for  thy  praise  and  glory  and  for <br/>the  salvation  of  man,  I  earnestly  beseech  thee  that  thou  wouldst  send  one  of  thy  spirits  of  the  order  of <br/>Jupiter,  one  of  the  messengers  of  Zadkiel  whom  thou  hast  appointed  governor  of  thy  firmament  at <br/>the  present  time,  most  faithfully,  willingly,  and  readily  to  show  me  these  things  which  I  shall  ask, <br/>command  or  require  of  him,  and  truly  execute  my  desires.  Nevertheless,  O  Most  Holy  God,  thy  will <br/>and  not  mine  be  done  through  JC,  thine  only  begotten  Son  our  Lord.  Amen. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Invocation. <br/><br/>[The  magician,  having  properly  consecrated  his  vestments  and  utensils  and  being  protected  by  his <br/>circle,  now  calls  upon  the  spirits  to  appear  and  accede  to  his  demands.] <br/><br/>&quot;Spirits,  whose  assistance  I  require,  behold  the  sign  and  the  very  Hallowed  Names  of  God  full  of <br/>power.  Obey  the  power  of  this  our  pentacle;  go  out  your  hidden  caves  and  dark  places;  cease  your <br/>hurtful  occupations  to  those  unhappy  mortals  whom  without  ceasing  you  torment;  come  into  this <br/>place  where  the  Divine  Goodness  has  assembled  us;  be  attentive  to  our  orders  and  known  to  our  just <br/>demands;  believe  not  that  your  resistance  will  cause  us  to  abandon  our  operations.

Fiat,  fiat,  fiat. <br/>Amen,  Amen,  Amen. <br/><br/>&quot;Interrogatories. <br/><br/>[Having  summoned  the  spirit  unto  his  presence,  the  magician  shall  question  him  as  follows:] <br/><br/>'&quot;Comest  thou  in  peace  in  the  Name  of  the  Father  and  of  the  Son  and  of  the  Holy  Ghost?'  [And  the <br/>spirit  shall  answer:]  'Yes.' <br/><br/>'&quot;Thou  art  welcome,  noble  Spirit.  What  is  thy  Name?'

The  pentagram  is  the  figure  of  the  microcosm&#x2014;the  magical  formula  of  man.  It  is  the  one  rising  out  of <br/>the  four&#x2014;the  human  soul  rising  from  the  bondage  of  the  animal  nature.

Having  obtained  his  desires  of  the  Spirit,  the  invocant  may  license <br/>him  to  depart.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>p.  104 <br/><br/><br/>unto  my  petitions,  I  give  humble  and  hearty  thanks  unto  Almighty  God  in  whose  Name  I  called  and <br/>thou  earnest,  and  now  thou  mayest  depart  in  peace  unto  thine  orders  and  return  unto  me  again  at <br/>what  time  soever  I  shall  call  thee  by  thine  oath,  or  by  thy  name  or  by  thine  order,  or  by  thine  office <br/>which  is  granted  thee  from  the  Creator,  and  the  power  of  God  be  with  me  and  thee  and  upon  the <br/>whole  issue  of  God,  Amen. <br/><br/>'&quot;Glory  be  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son,  and  to  the  Holy  Ghost.' <br/><br/>[Note.]  &quot;It  would  be  advisable  for  the  invocant  to  remain  in  the  circle  for  a  few  minutes  after  reciting <br/>the  license,  and  if  the  place  of  operation  be  in  the  open  air,  let  him  destroy  all  traces  of  the  circle, <br/>etcetera,  and  return  quietly  to  his  home.  But  should  the  operation  be  performed  in  a  retired  part  of  a <br/>house,  cc  cetera,  the  circle  may  remain,  as  it  might  serve  in  alike  future  operation,  but  the  room  or <br/>building  must  be  locked  up  to  avoid  the  intrusion  of  strangers.&quot; <br/><br/>The  agreement  set  forth  above  is  purely  ceremonial  magic.  In  the  case  of  black  magic,  it  is  the <br/>magician  and  not  the  demon  who  must  sign  the  pact.  When  the  black  magician  binds  an  elemental  to <br/>his  service,  a  battle  of  wits  ensues,  which  the  demon  eventually  wins.  With  his  own  blood  the <br/>magician  signs  the  pact  between  himself  and  the  demon,  for  in  the  arcanum  of  magic  it  is  declared <br/>that  &quot;he  controls  the  soul  who  controls  the  blood  of  another.&quot;  As  long  as  the  magician  does  not  fail, <br/>the  elemental  will  fulfil  to  the  letter  his  obligation  under  the  pact,  but  the  demon  will  try  in  every <br/>possible  way  to  prevent  the  magician  from  carrying  out  his  part  of  the  contract.  When  the  conjurer, <br/>ensconced  within  his  circle,  has  evoked  the  spirit  he  desires  to  control  and  has  made  known  his <br/>intention,  the  spirit  will  answer  somewhat  as  follows:  &quot;I  cannot  accede  to  your  request  nor  fulfil  it, <br/>unless  after  fifty  years  you  give  yourself  to  me,  body  and  soul,  to  do  with  as  I  may  please.&quot; <br/><br/>If  the  magician  refuses,  other  terms  will  be  discussed.  The  spirit  may  say:  &quot;I  will  remain  in  your <br/>service  as  long  as  on  every  Friday  morning  you  will  go  forth  upon  the  public  street  giving  alms  in  the <br/>name  of  Lucifer.  The  first  time  you  fail  in  this  you  belong  to  me.&quot; <br/><br/>If  the  magician  still  refuses,  realizing  that  the  demon  will  make  it  impossible  for  him  to  fulfil  his <br/>contract,  other  terms  will  be  discussed,  until  at  last  a  pact  is  agreed  upon.  It  may  read  as  follows:  &quot;I <br/>hereby  promise  the  Great  Spirit  Lucifuge,  Prince  of  Demons,  that  each  year  I  will  bring  unto  him  a <br/>human  soul  to  do  with  as  it  may  please  him,  and  in  return  Lucifuge  promises  to  bestow  upon  me  the <br/>treasures  of  the  earth  and  fulfil  my  every  desire  for  the  length  of  my  natural  life.  If  I  fail  to  bring  him <br/><br/>each  year  the  offering  specified  above,  then  my  own  soul  shall  be  forfeit  to  him.  Signed  <br/><br/>&quot;  [Invocant  signs  pact  with  his  own  blood.] <br/><br/>THE  PENTAGRAM <br/><br/>In  symbolism,  an  inverted  figure  always  signifies  a  perverted  power.  The  average  person  does  not <br/>even  suspect  the  occult  properties  of  emblematic  pentacles.  On  this  subject  the  great  Paracelsus  has <br/>written:  &quot;No  doubt  many  will  scoff  at  the  seals,  their  characters  and  their  uses,  which  are  described  in <br/>these  books,  because  it  seems  incredible  to  them  that  metals  and  characters  which  are  dead  should <br/>have  any  power  and  effect.  Yet  no  one  has  ever  proved  that  the  metals  and  also  the  characters  as  we <br/>know  them  are  dead,  for  the  salts,  sulphur,  and  quintessences  of  metals  are  the  highest  preservatives <br/>of  human  life  and  are  far  superior  to  all  other  simples.&quot;  (Translated  from  the  original  German.) <br/><br/>The  black  magician  cannot  use  the  symbols  of  white  magic  without  bringing  down  upon  himself  the <br/>forces  of  white  magic,  which  would  be  fatal  to  his  schemes.  He  must  therefore  distort  the  hierograms <br/>so  that  they  typify  the  occult  fact  that  he  himself  is  distorting  the  principles  for  which  the  symbols <br/>stand.  Black  magic  is  not  a  fundamental  art;  it  is  the  misuse  of  an  art.  Therefore  it  has  no  symbols  of <br/><br/><br/>its  own.  It  merely  takes  the  emblematic  figures  of  white  magic,  and  by  inverting  and  reversing  them <br/>signifies  that  it  is  left-handed. <br/><br/>A  good  instance  of  this  practice  is  found  in  the  pentagram,  or  five-pointed  star,  made  of  five <br/>connected  lines.  This  figure  is  the  time-honored  symbol  of  the  magical  arts,  and  signifies  the  five <br/>properties  of  the  Great  Magical  Agent,  the  five  senses  of  man,  the  five  elements  of  nature,  the  five <br/>extremities  of  the  human  body.  By  means  of  the  pentagram  within  his  own  soul,  man  not  only  may <br/>master  and  govern  all  creatures  inferior  to  himself,  but  may  demand  consideration  at  the  hands  of <br/>those  superior  to  himself. <br/><br/>The  pentagram  is  used  extensively  in  black  magic,  but  when  so  used  its  form  always  differs  in  one  of <br/>three  ways:  The  star  may  be  broken  at  one  point  by  not  permitting  the  converging  lines  to  touch;  it <br/>may  be  inverted  by  having  one  point  down  and  two  up;  or  it  may  be  distorted  by  having  the  points  of <br/>varying  lengths.  When  used  in  black  magic,  the  pentagram  is  called  the  &quot;sign  of  the  cloven  hoof,&quot;  or <br/>the  footprint  of  the  Devil.  The  star  with  two  points  upward  is  also  called  the  &quot;Goat  of  Mendes,&quot; <br/>because  the  inverted  star  is  the  same  shape  as  a  goat's  head.  When  the  upright  star  turns  and  the <br/>upper  point  falls  to  the  bottom,  it  signifies  the  fall  of  the  Morning  Star. <br/><br/><br/>THE  PENTACLES  OF  THE  SEVEN  PLANETS  AND  THE  SEALS  AND  CHARACTERS  OF  THE  PLANETARY  ANGELS. <br/><br/>From  a  mediaeval  Book  of  Spirits  (unpublished). <br/><br/><br/>The  seven  large  circle  are  the  planets,  while  the  two  small  circles  under  each  contain  the  seal  and  the  character  of  the <br/>controlling  intelligence  of  the  planet. <br/><br/><br/>p.  105 <br/><br/><br/>The  Elements  and  Their  Inhabitants <br/><br/>FOR  the  most  comprehensive  and  lucid  exposition  of  occuh  pneumatology  (the  branch  of  philosophy <br/>dealing  with  spiritual  substances)  extant,  mankind  is  indebted  to  Philippus  Aureolus  Paracelsus <br/>(Theophrastus  Bombastus  von  Hohenheim),  prince  of  alchemists  and  Hermetic  philosophers  and <br/>true  possessor  of  the  Royal  Secret  (the  Philosopher's  Stone  and  the  Elixir  of  Life).  Paracelsus  believed <br/>that  each  of  the  four  primary  elements  known  to  the  ancients  (earth,  fire,  air,  and  water)  consisted  of <br/>a  subtle,  vaporous  principle  and  a  gross  corporeal  substance. <br/><br/>Air  is,  therefore,  twofold  in  nature-tangible  atmosphere  and  an  intangible,  volatile  substratum  which <br/>may  be  termed  spiritual  air.  Fire  is  visible  and  invisible,  discernible  and  indiscernible&#x2014;a  spiritual, <br/>ethereal  flame  manifesting  through  a  material,  substantial  flame.  Carrying  the  analogy  further,  water <br/>consists  of  a  dense  fluid  and  a  potential  essence  of  a  fluidic  nature.  Earth  has  likewise  two  essential <br/>parts&#x2014;the  lower  being  fixed,  terreous,  immobile;  the  higher,  rarefied,  mobile,  and  virtual.  The  general <br/>term  elements  has  been  applied  to  the  lower,  or  physical,  phases  of  these  four  primary  principles,  and <br/>the  name  elemental  essences  to  their  corresponding  invisible,  spiritual  constitutions.  Minerals,  plants, <br/>animals,  and  men  live  in  a  world  composed  of  the  gross  side  of  these  four  elements,  and  from  various <br/>combinations  of  them  construct  their  living  organisms. <br/><br/>Henry  Drummond,  in  Natural  Law  in  the  Spiritual  World,  describes  this  process  as  follows:  &quot;If  we <br/>analyse  this  material  point  at  which  all  life  starts,  we  shall  find  it  to  consist  of  a  clear  structureless, <br/>jelly-like  substance  resembling  albumen  or  white  of  egg.  It  is  made  of  Carbon,  Hydrogen,  Oxygen  and <br/>Nitrogen.  Its  name  is  protoplasm.  And  it  is  not  only  the  structural  unit  with  which  all  living  bodies <br/>start  in  life,  but  with  which  they  are  subsequently  built  up.  'Protoplasm,'  says  Huxley,  'simple  or <br/>nucleated,  is  the  formal  basis  of  all  life.  It  is  the  clay  of  the  Potter.'&quot; <br/><br/>The  water  element  of  the  ancient  philosophers  has  been  metamorphosed  into  the  hydrogen  of <br/>modern  science;  the  air  has  become  oxygen;  the  fire,  nitrogen;  the  earth,  carbon. <br/><br/>Just  as  visible  Nature  is  populated  by  an  infinite  number  of  living  creatures,  so,  according  to <br/>Paracelsus,  the  invisible,  spiritual  counterpart  of  visible  Nature  (composed  of  the  tenuous  principles <br/>of  the  visible  elements)  is  inhabited  by  a  host  of  peculiar  beings,  to  whom  he  has  given  the  name <br/>elementals,  and  which  have  later  been  termed  the  Nature  spirits.  Paracelsus  divided  these  people  of <br/>the  elements  into  four  distinct  groups,  which  he  called  gnomes,  undines,  sylphs,  and  salamanders. <br/>He  taught  that  they  were  really  living  entities,  many  resembling  human  beings  in  shape,  and <br/>inhabiting  worlds  of  their  own,  unknown  to  man  because  his  undeveloped  senses  were  incapable  of <br/>functioning  beyond  the  limitations  of  the  grosser  elements. <br/><br/>The  civilizations  of  Greece,  Rome,  Egypt,  China,  and  India  believed  implicitly  in  satyrs,  sprites,  and <br/>goblins.  They  peopled  the  sea  with  mermaids,  the  rivers  and  fountains  with  nymphs,  the  air  with <br/>fairies,  the  fire  with  Lares  and  Penates,  and  the  earth  with  fauns,  dryads,  and  hamadryads.  These <br/>Nature  spirits  were  held  in  the  highest  esteem,  and  propitiatory  offerings  were  made  to  them. <br/>Occasionally,  as  the  result  of  atmospheric  conditions  or  the  peculiar  sensitiveness  of  the  devotee,  they <br/>became  visible.  Many  authors  wrote  concerning  them  in  terms  which  signify  that  they  had  actually <br/>beheld  these  inhabitants  of  Nature's  finer  realms.  A  number  of  authorities  are  of  the  opinion  that <br/>many  of  the  gods  worshiped  by  the  pagans  were  elementals,  for  some  of  these  invisibles  were  believed <br/>to  be  of  commanding  stature  and  magnificent  deportment. <br/><br/>The  Greeks  gave  the  name  dsemon  to  some  of  these  elementals,  especially  those  of  the  higher  orders, <br/>and  worshiped  them.  Probably  the  most  famous  of  these  daemons  is  the  mysterious  spirit  which <br/><br/><br/>instructed  Socrates,  and  of  whom  that  great  philosopher  spoke  in  the  highest  terms.  Those  who  have <br/>devoted  much  study  to  the  invisible  constitution  of  man  realize  that  it  is  quite  probable  the  dsmon  of <br/>Socrates  and  the  angel  of  Jakob  Bohme  were  in  reality  not  elementals,  but  the  overshadowing  divine <br/>natures  of  these  philosophers  themselves.  In  his  notes  to  Apuleius  on  the  God  of  Socrates,  Thomas <br/>Taylor  says: <br/><br/>&quot;As  the  daemon  of  Socrates,  therefore,  was  doubtless  one  of  the  highest  order,  as  may  be  inferred  from <br/>the  intellectual  superiority  of  Socrates  to  most  other  men,  Apuleius  is  justified  in  calling  this  deemon  a <br/>God.  And  that  the  daemon  of  Socrates  indeed  was  divine,  is  evident  from  the  testimony  of  Socrates <br/>himself  in  the  First  Alcibiades:  for  in  the  course  of  that  dialogue  he  clearly  says,  'I  have  long  been  of <br/>the  opinion  that  the  God  did  not  as  yet  direct  me  to  hold  any  conversation  with  you.'  And  in  the <br/>Apology  he  most  unequivocally  evinces  that  this  deemon  is  allotted  a  divine  transcendency, <br/>considered  as  ranking  in  the  order  of  daemons.&quot; <br/><br/>The  idea  once  held,  that  the  invisible  elements  surrounding  and  interpenetrating  the  earth  were <br/>peopled  with  living,  intelligent  beings,  may  seem  ridiculous  to  the  prosaic  mind  of  today.  This <br/>doctrine,  however,  has  found  favor  with  some  of  the  greatest  intellects  of  the  world.  The  sylphs  of <br/>Facius  Cardin,  the  philosopher  of  Milan;  the  salamander  seen  by  Benvenuto  Cellini;  the  pan  of  St. <br/>Anthony;  and  le  petit  homme  rouge  (the  little  red  man,  or  gnome)  of  Napoleon  Bonaparte,  have <br/>found  their  places  in  the  pages  of  history. <br/><br/>Literature  has  also  perpetuated  the  concept  of  Nature  spirits.  The  mischievous  Puck  of  Shakespeare's <br/>Midsummer  Night's  Dream;  the  elementals  of  Alexander  Pope's  Rosicrucian  poem,  The  Rape  of  the <br/>Lock,  the  mysterious  creatures  of  Lord  Lytton's  Zanoni;  James  Barrie's  immortal  Tinker  Bell;  and  the <br/>famous  bowlers  that  Rip  Van  Winkle  encountered  in  the  Catskill  Mountains,  are  well-known <br/>characters  to  students  of  literature.  The  folklore  and  mjlihology  of  all  peoples  abound  in  legends <br/>concerning  these  mysterious  little  figures  who  haunt  old  castles,  guard  treasures  in  the  depths  of  the <br/>earth,  and  build  their  homes  under  the  spreading  protection  of  toadstools.  Fairies  are  the  delight  of <br/>childhood,  and  most  children  give  them  up  with  reluctance.  Not  so  very  long  ago  the  greatest  minds <br/>of  the  world  believed  in  the  existence  of  fairies,  and  it  is  still  an  open  question  as  to  whether  Plato, <br/>Socrates,  and  lamblichus  were  wrong  when  they  avowed  their  reality. <br/><br/>Paracelsus,  when  describing  the  substances  which  constitute  the  bodies  of  the  elementals,  divided <br/>flesh  into  two  kinds,  the  first  being  that  which  we  have  all  inherited  through  Adam.  This  is  the  visible, <br/>corporeal  flesh.  The  second  was  that  flesh  which  had  not  descended  from  Adam  and,  being  more <br/>attenuated,  was  not  subject  to  the  limitations  of  the  former.  The  bodies  of  the  elementals  were <br/>composed  of  this  transubstantial  flesh.  Paracelsus  stated  that  there  is  as  much  difference  between  the <br/>bodies  of  men  and  the  bodies  of  the  Nature  spirits  as  there  is  between  matter  and  spirit. <br/><br/>&quot;Yet,&quot;  he  adds,  &quot;the  Elementals  are  not  spirits,  because  they  have  flesh,  blood  and  bones;  they  live  and <br/>propagate  offspring;  they  cat  and  talk,  act  and  sleep,  &amp;c.,  and  consequently  they  cannot  be  properly <br/>called  'spirits.'  They  are  beings  occupying  a  place  between  men  and  spirits,  resembling  men  and <br/>spirits,  resembling  men  and  women  in  their  organization  and  form,  and  resembling  spirits  in  the <br/>rapidity  of  their  locomotion.&quot;  {Philosophia  Occulta,  translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.)  Later  the  same <br/>author  calls  these  creatures  composita,  inasmuch  as  the  substance  out  of  which  they  are  composed <br/>seems  to  be  a  composite  of  spirit  and  matter.  He  uses  color  to  explain  the  idea.  Thus,  the  mixture  of <br/>blue  and  red  gives  purple,  a  new  color,  resembling  neither  of  the  others  yet  composed  of  both.  Such  is <br/>the  case  with  the  Nature  spirits;  they  resemble  neither  spiritual  creatures  nor  material  beings,  yet  are <br/>composed  of  the  substance  which  we  may  call  spiritual  matter,  or  ether. <br/><br/>Paracelsus  further  adds  that  whereas  man  is  composed  of  several  natures  (spirit,  soul,  mind,  and <br/>body)  combined  in  one  unit,  the  elemental  has  but  one  principle,  the  ether  out  of  which  it  is <br/>composed  and  in  which  it  lives.  The  reader  must  remember  that  by  ether <br/><br/><br/>A  SALAMANDER,  ACCORDING  TO  PARACELSUS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Paracelsus'  Anslegung  von  30  magischen  Figuren. <br/><br/>The  Egyptians,  Chaldeans,  and  Persians  often  mistook  the  salamanders  for  gods,  because  of  their  radiant  splendor  and <br/>great  power.  The  Greeks,  following  the  example  of  earlier  nations,  deified  the  fire  spirits  and  in  their  honor  kept  incense <br/>and  altar  fire,  burning  perpetually. <br/><br/>p.  106 <br/><br/>is  meant  the  spiritual  essence  of  one  of  the  four  elements.  There  areas  many  ethers  as  there  are <br/>elements  and  as  many  distinct  families  of  Nature  spirits  as  there  are  ethers.  These  families  are <br/>completely  isolated  in  their  own  ether  and  have  no  intercourse  with  the  denizens  of  the  other  ethers; <br/>but,  as  man  has  within  his  own  nature  centers  of  consciousness  sensitive  to  the  impulses  of  all  the <br/>four  ethers,  it  is  possible  for  any  of  the  elemental  kingdoms  to  communicate  with  him  under  proper <br/>conditions. <br/><br/>The  Nature  spirits  cannot  be  destroyed  by  the  grosser  elements,  such  as  material  fire,  earth,  air,  or <br/>water,  for  they  function  in  a  rate  of  vibration  higher  than  that  of  earthy  substances.  Being  composed <br/>of  only  one  element  or  principle  (the  ether  in  which  they  function),  they  have  no  immortal  spirit  and <br/>at  death  merely  disintegrate  back  into  the  element  from  which  they  were  originally  individualized.  No <br/>individual  consciousness  is  preserved  after  death,  for  there  is  no  superior  vehicle  present  to  contain  it. <br/>Being  made  of  but  one  substance,  there  is  no  friction  between  vehicles:  thus  there  is  little  wear  or  tear <br/>incurred  by  their  bodily  functions,  and  they  therefore  live  to  great  age.  Those  composed  of  earth  ether <br/>are  the  shortest  lived;  those  composed  of  air  ether,  the  longest.  The  average  length  of  life  is  between <br/>three  hundred  and  a  thousand  years.  Paracelsus  maintained  that  they  live  in  conditions  similar  to  our <br/>earth  environments,  and  are  somewhat  subject  to  disease.  These  creatures  are  thought  to  be <br/>incapable  of  spiritual  development,  but  most  of  them  are  of  a  high  moral  character. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  elemental  ethers  in  which  the  Nature  spirits  exist,  Paracelsus  wrote:  &quot;They  live  in  the <br/>four  elements:  the  Nymphse  in  the  element  of  water,  the  Sylphes  in  that  of  the  air,  the  Pigmies  in  the <br/>earth,  and  the  Salamanders  in  fire.  They  are  also  called  Undinge,  Sylvestres,  Gnomi,  Vulcani,  &amp;c.  Each <br/>species  moves  only  in  the  element  to  which  it  belongs,  and  neither  of  them  can  go  out  of  its <br/><br/><br/>appropriate  element,  which  is  to  them  as  the  air  is  to  us,  or  the  water  to  fishes;  and  none  of  them  can <br/>live  in  the  element  belonging  to  another  class.  To  each  elemental  being  the  element  in  which  it  lives  is <br/>transparent,  invisible  and  respirable,  as  the  atmosphere  is  to  ourselves.&quot;  {Philosophia  Occulta, <br/>translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>The  reader  should  be  careful  not  to  confuse  the  Nature  spirits  with  the  true  life  waves  evolving <br/>through  the  invisible  worlds.  While  the  elementals  are  composed  of  only  one  etheric  (or  atomic) <br/>essence,  the  angels,  archangels,  and  other  superior,  transcendental  entities  have  composite  organisms, <br/>consisting  of  a  spiritual  nature  and  a  chain  of  vehicles  to  express  that  nature  not  unlike  those  of  men, <br/>but  not  including  the  physical  body  with  its  attendant  limitations. <br/><br/>To  the  philosophy  of  Nature  spirits  is  generally  attributed  an  Eastern  origin,  probably  Brahmanic; <br/>and  Paracelsus  secured  his  knowledge  of  them  from  Oriental  sages  with  whom  he  came  in  contact <br/>during  his  lifetime  of  philosophical  wanderings.  The  Egyptians  and  Greeks  gleaned  their  information <br/>from  the  same  source.  The  four  main  divisions  of  Nature  spirits  must  now  be  considered  separately, <br/>according  to  the  teachings  of  Paracelsus  and  the  Abbe  de  Villars  and  such  scanty  writings  of  other <br/>authors  as  are  available. <br/><br/>THE  GNOMES <br/><br/>The  elementals  who  dwell  in  that  attenuated  body  of  the  earth  which  is  called  the  terreous  ether  are <br/>grouped  together  under  the  general  heading  of  gnomes.  (The  name  is  probably  derived  from  the <br/>Greek  genomus,  meaning  earth  dweller.  See  New  English  Dictionary.) <br/><br/>Just  as  there  are  many  types  of  human  beings  evolving  through  the  objective  physical  elements  of <br/>Nature,  so  there  are  many  types  of  gnomes  evolving  through  the  subjective  ethereal  body  of  Nature. <br/>These  earth  spirits  work  in  an  element  so  close  in  vibratory  rate  to  the  material  earth  that  they  have <br/>immense  power  over  its  rocks  and  flora,  and  also  over  the  mineral  elements  in  the  animal  and  human <br/>kingdoms.  Some,  like  the  pygmies,  work  with  the  stones,  gems,  and  metals,  and  are  supposed  to  be <br/>the  guardians  of  hidden  treasures.  They  live  in  caves,  far  down  in  what  the  Scandinavians  called  the <br/>Land  of  the  Nibelungen.  In  Wagner's  wonderful  opera  cycle.  The  Ring  of  the  Nibelungen,  Alberich <br/>makes  himself  King  of  the  Pygmies  and  forces  these  little  creatures  to  gather  for  him  the  treasures <br/>concealed  beneath  the  surface  of  the  earth. <br/><br/>Besides  the  pygmies  there  are  other  gnomes,  who  are  called  tree  and  forest  sprites.  To  this  group <br/>belong  the  sylvestres,  satyrs,  pans,  dryads,  hamadryads,  durdalis,  elves,  brownies,  and  little  old  men <br/>of  the  woods.  Paracelsus  states  that  the  gnomes  build  houses  of  substances  resembling  in  their <br/>constituencies  alabaster,  marble,  and  cement,  but  the  true  nature  of  these  materials  is  unknown, <br/>having  no  counterpart  in  physical  nature.  Some  families  of  gnomes  gather  in  communities,  while <br/>others  are  indigenous  to  the  substances  with  and  in  which  they  work.  For  example,  the  hamadryads <br/>live  and  die  with  the  plants  or  trees  of  which  they  are  a  part.  Every  shrub  and  flower  is  said  to  have  its <br/>own  Nature  spirit,  which  often  uses  the  physical  body  of  the  plant  as  its  habitation.  The  ancient <br/>philosophers,  recognizing  the  principle  of  intelligence  manifesting  itself  in  every  department  of <br/>Nature  alike,  believed  that  the  quality  of  natural  selection  exhibited  by  creatures  not  possessing <br/>organized  mentalities  expressed  in  reality  the  decisions  of  the  Nature  spirits  themselves. <br/><br/>C.  M.  Gayley,  in  The  Classic  Myths,  says:  &quot;It  was  a  pleasing  trait  in  the  old  paganism  that  it  loved  to <br/>trace  in  every  operation  of  nature  the  agency  of  deity.  The  imagination  of  the  Greeks  peopled  the <br/>regions  of  earth  and  sea  with  divinities,  to  whose  agency  it  attributed  the  phenomena  that  our <br/>philosophy  ascribes  to  the  operation  of  natural  law.&quot;  Thus,  in  behalf  of  the  plant  it  worked  with,  the <br/>elemental  accepted  and  rejected  food  elements,  deposited  coloring  matter  therein,  preserved  and <br/>protected  the  seed,  and  performed  many  other  beneficent  offices.  Each  species  was  served  by  a <br/>different  but  appropriate  type  of  Nature  spirit.  Those  working  with  poisonous  shrubs,  for  example. <br/><br/><br/>were  offensive  in  their  appearance.  It  is  said  the  Nature  spirits  of  poison  hemlock  resemble  closely <br/><br/>tiny  human  skeletons,  thinly  covered  with  a  semi-transparent  flesh.  They  live  in  and  through  the <br/>hemlock,  and  if  it  be  cut  down  remain  with  the  broken  shoots  until  both  die,  but  while  there  is  the <br/>slightest  evidence  of  life  in  the  shrub  it  shows  the  presence  of  the  elemental  guardian. <br/><br/>Great  trees  also  have  their  Nature  spirits,  but  these  are  much  larger  than  the  elementals  of  smaller <br/>plants.  The  labors  of  the  pygmies  include  the  cutting  of  the  crystals  in  the  rocks  and  the  development <br/>of  veins  of  ore.  When  the  gnomes  are  laboring  with  animals  or  human  beings,  their  work  is  confined <br/>to  the  tissues  corresponding  with  their  own  natures.  Hence  they  work  with  the  bones,  which  belong  to <br/>the  mineral  kingdom,  and  the  ancients  believed  the  reconstruction  of  broken  members  to  be <br/>impossible  without  the  cooperation  of  the  elementals. <br/><br/>The  gnomes  are  of  various  sizes&#x2014;most  of  them  much  smaller  than  human  beings,  though  some  of <br/>them  have  the  power  of  changing  their  stature  at  will.  This  is  the  result  of  the  extreme  mobility  of  the <br/>element  in  which  they  function.  Concerning  them  the  Abbe  de  Villars  wrote:  &quot;The  earth  is  filled  well <br/>nigh  to  its  center  with  Gnomes,  people  of  slight  stature,  who  are  the  guardians  of  treasures,  minerals <br/>and  precious  stones.  They  are  ingenious,  friends  of  man,  and  easy  to  govern.&quot; <br/><br/>Not  all  authorities  agree  concerning  the  amiable  disposition  of  the  gnomes.  Many  state  that  they  are <br/>of  a  tricky  and  malicious  nature,  difficult  to  manage,  and  treacherous.  Writers  agree,  however,  that <br/>when  their  confidence  is  won  they  are  faithful  and  true.  The  philosophers  and  initiates  of  the  ancient <br/>world  were  instructed  concerning  these  mysterious  little  people  and  were  taught  how  to  communicate <br/>with  them  and  gain  their  cooperation  in  undertakings  of  importance.  The  magi  were  always  warned, <br/>however,  never  to  betray  the  trust  of  the  elementals,  for  if  they  did,  the  invisible  creatures,  working <br/>through  the  subjective  nature  of  man,  could  cause  them  endless  sorrow  and  probably  ultimate <br/>destruction.  So  long  as  the  mystic  served  others,  the  gnomes  would  serve  him,  but  if  he  sought  to  use <br/>their  aid  selfishly  to  gain  temporal  power  they  would  turn  upon  him  with  unrelenting  fury.  The  same <br/>was  true  if  he  sought  to  deceive  them. <br/><br/>The  earth  spirits  meet  at  certain  times  of  the  year  in  great  conclaves,  as  Shakespeare  suggests  in  his <br/>Midsummer  Night's  Dream,  where  the  elementals  all  gather  to  rejoice  in  the  beauty  and  harmony  of <br/>Nature  and  the  prospects  of  an  excellent  harvest.  The  gnomes  are  ruled  over  by  a  king,  whom  they <br/>greatly  love  and  revere.  His  name  is  Gob;  hence  his  subjects  are  often  called  goblins.  Mediaeval <br/>mystics  gave  a  comer  of  creation  (one  of  the  cardinal  points)  to  each  of  the  four  kingdoms  of  Nature <br/>spirits,  and  because  of  their  earthy  character  the  gnomes  were  assigned  to  the  North&#x2014;the  place <br/>recognized  by  the  ancients  as  the  source  of  darkness  and  death.  One  of  the  four  main  divisions  of <br/>human  disposition  was  also  assigned  to  the  gnomes,  and  because  so  many  of  them  dwelt  in  the <br/>darkness  of  caves  and  the  gloom  of  forests  their  temperament  was  said  to  be  melancholy,  gloomy,  and <br/>despondent.  By  this  it  is  not  meant  that  they  themselves  are  of  such  disposition,  but  rather  that  they <br/>have  special  control  over  elements  of  similar  consistency. <br/><br/>The  gnomes  marry  and  have  families,  and  the  female  gnomes  are  called  gnomides.  Some  wear <br/>clothing  woven  of  the  element  in  which  they  live.  In  other  instances  their  garments  are  part  of <br/>themselves  and  grow  with  them,  like  the  fur  of  animals.  The  gnomes  are  said  to  have  insatiable <br/>appetites,  and  to  spend  a  great  part  of  the  rime  eating,  but  they  earn  their  food  by  diligent  and <br/>conscientious <br/><br/><br/>CONVENTIONAL  GNOMES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Gjellerup's  DenMldre  Eddas  Gudesange. <br/><br/>The  type  of  gnome  most  frequently  seen  is  the  brownie,  or  elf,  a  mischievous  and  grotesque  little  creature  from  twelve  to <br/>eighteen  inches  high,  usually  dressed  in  green  or  russet  brown.  Most  of  them  appear  as  very  aged,  often  with  long  white <br/>beards,  and  their  figures  are  inclined  to  rotundity.  They  can  be  seen  scampering  out  of  holes  in  the  stumps  of  trees  and <br/>sometimes  they  vanish  by  actually  dissolving  into  the  tree  itself. <br/><br/>p.  107 <br/><br/>labor.  Most  of  them  are  of  a  miserly  temperament,  fond  of  storing  things  away  in  secret  places.  There <br/>is  abundant  evidence  of  the  fact  that  small  children  often  see  the  gnomes,  inasmuch  as  their  contact <br/>with  the  material  side  of  Nature  is  not  yet  complete  and  they  still  function  more  or  less  consciously  in <br/>the  invisible  worlds. <br/><br/>According  to  Paracelsus,  &quot;Man  lives  in  the  exterior  elements  and  the  Elementals  live  in  the  interior <br/>elements.  The  latter  have  dwellings  and  clothing,  manners  and  customs,  languages  and  governments <br/>of  their  own,  in  the  same  sense  as  the  bees  have  their  queens  and  herds  of  animals  their  leaders.&quot; <br/>(Philosophia  Occulta,  translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>Paracelsus  differs  somewhat  from  the  Greek  mystics  concerning  the  environmental  limitations <br/>imposed  on  the  Nature  spirits.  The  Swiss  philosopher  constitutes  them  of  subtle  invisible  ethers. <br/>According  to  this  hypothesis  they  would  be  visible  only  at  certain  times  and  only  to  those  en  rapport <br/>with  their  ethereal  vibrations.  The  Greeks,  on  the  other  hand,  apparently  believed  that  many  Nature <br/>spirits  had  material  constitutions  capable  of  functioning  in  the  physical  world.  Often  the  recollection <br/>of  a  dream  is  so  vivid  that,  upon  awakening,  a  person  actually  believes  that  he  has  passed  through  a <br/>physical  experience.  The  difficulty  of  accurately  judging  as  to  the  end  of  physical  sight  and  the <br/>beginning  of  ethereal  vision  may  account  for  these  differences  of  opinion. <br/><br/>Even  this  explanation,  however,  does  not  satisfactorily  account  for  the  satyr  which,  according  to  St. <br/>Jerome,  was  captured  alive  during  the  reign  of  Constantine  and  exhibited  to  the  people.  It  was  of <br/>human  form  with  the  horns  and  feet  of  a  goat.  After  its  death  it  was  preserved  in  salt  and  taken  to  the <br/>Emperor  that  he  might  testify  to  its  reality.  (It  is  within  the  bounds  of  probability  that  this  curiosity <br/>was  what  modern  science  knows  as  a  monstrosity.) <br/><br/>THE  UNDINES <br/><br/>As  the  gnomes  were  limited  in  their  function  to  the  elements  of  the  earth,  so  the  undines  (a  name <br/>given  to  the  family  of  water  elementals)  function  in  the  invisible,  spiritual  essence  called  humid  (or <br/><br/><br/>liquid)  ether.  In  its  vibratory  rate  this  is  close  to  the  element  water,  and  so  the  undines  are  able  to <br/>control,  to  a  great  degree,  the  course  and  function  of  this  fluid  in  Nature.  Beauty  seems  to  be  the <br/>keynote  of  the  water  spirits.  Wherever  we  find  them  pictured  in  art  or  sculpture,  they  abound  in <br/>symmetry  and  grace.  Controlling  the  water  element &#x2014;which  has  always  been  a  feminine  symbol&#x2014;it  is <br/>natural  that  the  water  spirits  should  most  often  be  symbolized  as  female. <br/><br/>There  are  many  groups  of  undines.  Some  inhabit  waterfalls,  where  they  can  be  seen  in  the  spray; <br/>others  are  indigenous  to  swiftly  moving  rivers;  some  have  their  habitat  in  dripping,  oozing  fens  or <br/>marshes;  while  other  groups  dwell  in  clear  mountain  lakes.  According  to  the  philosophers  of  antiquity, <br/>every  fountain  had  its  nymph;  every  ocean  wave  its  oceanid.  The  water  spirits  were  known  under  such <br/>names  as  oreades,  nereides,  limoniades,  naiades,  water  sprites,  sea  maids,  mermaids,  and  potamides. <br/>Often  the  water  nymphs  derived  their  names  from  the  streams,  lakes,  or  seas  in  which  they  dwelt. <br/><br/>In  describing  them,  the  ancients  agreed  on  certain  salient  features.  In  general,  nearly  all  the  undines <br/>closely  resembled  human  beings  in  appearance  and  size,  though  the  ones  inhabiting  small  streams <br/>and  fountains  were  of  correspondingly  lesser  proportions.  It  was  believed  that  these  water  spirits <br/>were  occasionally  capable  of  assuming  the  appearance  of  normal  human  beings  and  actually <br/>associating  with  men  and  women.  There  are  many  legends  about  these  spirits  and  their  adoption  by <br/>the  families  of  fishermen,  but  in  nearly  every  case  the  undines  heard  the  call  of  the  waters  and <br/>returned  to  the  realm  of  Neptune,  the  King  of  the  Sea. <br/><br/>Practically  nothing  is  known  concerning  the  male  undines.  The  water  spirits  did  not  establish  homes <br/>in  the  same  way  that  the  gnomes  did,  but  lived  in  coral  caves  under  the  ocean  or  among  the  reeds <br/>growing  on  the  banks  of  rivers  or  the  shores  of  lakes.  Among  the  Celts  there  is  a  legend  to  the  effect <br/>that  Ireland  was  peopled,  before  the  coming  of  its  present  inhabitants,  by  a  strange  race  of  semi- <br/>divine  creatures;  with  the  coming  of  the  modem  Celts  they  retired  into  the  marshes  and  fens,  where <br/>they  remain  even  to  this  day.  Diminutive  undines  lived  under  lily  pads  and  in  little  houses  of  moss <br/>sprayed  by  waterfalls.  The  undines  worked  with  the  vital  essences  and  liquids  in  plants,  animals,  and <br/>human  beings,  and  were  present  in  everything  containing  water.  When  seen,  the  undines  generally <br/>resembled  the  goddesses  of  Greek  statuary.  They  rose  from  the  water  draped  in  mist  and  could  not <br/>exist  very  long  apart  from  it. <br/><br/>There  are  many  families  of  undines,  each  with  its  peculiar  limitations,  it  is  impossible  to  consider <br/>them  here  in  detail.  Their  ruler,  Necksa,  they  love  and  honor,  and  serve  untiringly.  Their <br/>temperament  is  said  to  be  vital,  and  to  them  has  been  given  as  their  throne  the  western  corner  of <br/>creation.  They  are  rather  emotional  beings,  friendly  to  human  life  and  fond  of  serving  mankind.  They <br/>are  sometimes  pictured  riding  on  dolphins  or  other  great  fish  and  seem  to  have  a  special  love  of <br/>flowers  and  plants,  which  they  serve  almost  as  devotedly  and  intelligently  as  the  gnomes.  Ancient <br/>poets  have  said  that  the  songs  of  the  undines  were  heard  in  the  West  Wind  and  that  their  lives  were <br/>consecrated  to  the  beautifying  of  the  material  earth. <br/><br/>THE  SALAMANDERS <br/><br/>The  third  group  of  elementals  is  the  salamanders,  or  spirits  of  fire,  who  live  in  that  attenuated, <br/>spiritual  ether  which  is  the  invisible  fire  element  of  Nature.  Without  them  material  fire  cannot  exist;  a <br/>match  cannot  be  struck  nor  will  flint  and  steel  give  off  their  spark  without  the  assistance  of  a <br/>salamander,  who  immediately  appears  (so  the  mediaeval  mystics  believed),  evoked  by  friction.  Man  is <br/>unable  to  communicate  successfully  with  the  salamanders,  owing  to  the  fiery  element  in  which  they <br/>dwell,  for  everything  is  resolved  to  ashes  that  comes  into  their  presence.  By  specially  prepared <br/>compounds  of  herbs  and  perfumes  the  philosophers  of  the  ancient  world  manufactured  many  kinds <br/>of  incense.  When  incense  was  burned,  the  vapors  which  arose  were  especially  suitable  as  a  medium <br/>for  the  expression  of  these  elementals,  who,  by  borrowing  the  ethereal  effluvium  from  the  incense <br/>smoke,  were  able  to  make  their  presence  felt. <br/><br/><br/>The  salamanders  are  as  varied  in  their  grouping  and  arrangement  as  either  the  undines  or  the <br/>gnomes.  There  are  many  famihes  of  them,  differing  in  appearance,  size,  and  dignity.  Sometimes  the <br/>salamanders  were  visible  as  small  balls  of  light.  Paracelsus  says:  &quot;Salamanders  have  been  seen  in  the <br/>shapes  of  fiery  balls,  or  tongues  of  fire,  running  over  the  fields  or  peering  in  houses.&quot;  (Philosophia <br/>Occulta,  translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>Mediaeval  investigators  of  the  Nature  spirits  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  most  common  form  of <br/>salamander  was  lizard-like  in  shape,  a  foot  or  more  in  length,  and  visible  as  a  glowing  Urodela, <br/>twisting  and  crawling  in  the  midst  of  the  fire.  Another  group  was  described  as  huge  flaming  giants  in <br/>flowing  robes,  protected  with  sheets  of  fiery  armor.  Certain  mediseval  authorities,  among  them  the <br/>Abbe  de  Villars,  held  that  Zarathustra  (Zoroaster)  was  the  son  of  Vesta  (believed  to  have  been  the  wife <br/>of  Noah)  and  the  great  salamander  Oromasis.  Hence,  from  that  time  onward,  undying  fires  have  been <br/>maintained  upon  the  Persian  altars  in  honor  of  Zarathustra's  flaming  father. <br/><br/>One  most  important  subdivision  of  the  salamanders  was  the  Acthnici.  These  creatures  appeared  only <br/>as  indistinct  globes.  They  were  supposed  to  float  over  water  at  night  and  occasionally  to  appear  as <br/>forks  of  flame  on  the  masts  and  rigging  of  ships  (St.  Elmo's  fire).  The  salamanders  were  the  strongest <br/>and  most  powerful  of  the  elementals,  and  had  as  their  ruler  a  magnificent  flaming  spirit  called  Djin, <br/>terrible  and  awe-inspiring  in  appearance.  The  salamanders  were  dangerous  and  the  sages  were <br/>warned  to  keep  away  from  them,  as  the  benefits  derived  from  studying  them  were  often  not <br/>commensurate  with  the  price  paid.  As  the  ancients  associated  heat  with  the  South,  this  corner  of <br/>creation  was  assigned  to  the  salamanders  as  their  drone,  and  they  exerted  special  influence  over  all <br/>beings  of  fiery  or  tempestuous  temperament.  In  both  animals  and  men,  the  salamanders  work <br/>through  the  emotional  nature  by  means  of  the  body  heat,  the  liver,  and  the  blood  stream.  Without <br/>their  assistance  there  would  be  no  warmth. <br/><br/><br/>While  the  sages  said  that  the  fourth  class  of  elementals,  or  sylphs,  lived  in  the  element  of  air,  they <br/>meant  by  this  not  the  natural  atmosphere  of  the  earth,  but  the  invisible,  intangible,  spiritual  medium- <br/>-an  ethereal  substance  similar  in  composition  to  our  atmosphere,  but  far  more  subtle.  In  the  last: <br/>discourse  of  Socrates,  as  preserved  by  Plato  in  his  Phsedo,  the  condemned  philosopher  says: <br/><br/>&quot;And  upon  the  earth  are  animals  and  men,  some  in  a  middle  region,  others  (elementals]  dwelling <br/>about  the  air  as  we  dwell  about  the  sea;  others  in  islands  which  the  air  flows  round,  near  the  continent; <br/>and  in  a  word,  the  air  is  used  by  them  as  the  water  and  the  sea  are  by  us,  and  the  ether  is  to  them  what <br/>the  air  is  to  us.  More  over,  the  temperament  of  their  seasons  is  such  that  they  have  no  disease <br/>[Paracelsus  disputes  this],  and  live  much  longer  than  we  do, <br/><br/><br/>THE  SYLPHS <br/><br/><br/>A  MERMAID. <br/><br/><br/>From  Lycosthenes'  Prodigiorum  ac  Ostentorum  Chronicon. <br/><br/><br/>Probably  the  most  famous  of  the  undines  were  the  mythological  mermaids,  with  which  early  mariners  peopled  the  Seven <br/>Seas.  Belief  in  the  existence  of  these  creatures,  the  upper  half  of  their  bodies  human  in  form  and  the  lower  half  fishlike, <br/>may  have  been  inspired  by  flocks  of  penguins  seen  at  great  distance,  or  possibly  seals.  In  mediaeval  descriptions  of <br/>mermaids,  it  was  also  stated  that  their  hair  was  green  like  seaweed  and  that  they  wore  wreaths  twisted  from  the  blossoms <br/>of  subaqueous  plants  and  sea  anemones. <br/><br/>p.  108 <br/><br/>and  have  sight  and  bearing  and  smell,  and  all  the  other  senses,  in  far  greater  perfection,  in  the  same <br/>degree  that  air  is  purer  than  water  or  the  ether  than  air.  Also  they  have  temples  and  sacred  places  in <br/>which  the  gods  really  dwell,  and  they  hear  their  voices  and  receive  their  answers,  and  are  conscious  of <br/>them  and  hold  converse  with  them,  and  they  see  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars  as  they  really  are,  and  their <br/>other  blessedness  is  of  a  piece  with  this.&quot;  While  the  sylphs  were  believed  to  live  among  the  clouds  and <br/>in  the  surrounding  air,  their  true  home  was  upon  the  tops  of  mountains. <br/><br/>In  his  editorial  notes  to  the  Occult  Sciences  of  Salverte,  Anthony  Todd  Thomson  says:  &quot;The  Fayes  and <br/>Fairies  are  evidently  of  Scandinavian  origin,  although  the  name  of  Fairy  is  supposed  to  be  derived <br/>from,  or  rather  [is]  a  modification  of  the  Persian  Peri,  an  imaginary  benevolent  being,  whose  province <br/>it  was  to  guard  men  from  the  maledictions  of  evil  spirits;  but  with  more  probability  it  may  be  referred <br/>to  the  Gothic  Fagur,  as  the  term  Elves  is  from  Alfa,  the  general  appellation  for  the  whole  tribe.  If  this <br/>derivation  of  the  name  of  Fairy  be  admitted,  we  may  date  the  commencement  of  the  popular  belief  in <br/>British  Fairies  to  the  period  of  the  Danish  conquest.  They  were  supposed  to  be  diminutive  aerial <br/>beings,  beautiful,  lively,  and  beneficent  in  their  intercourse  with  mortals,  inhabiting  a  region  called <br/>Fairy  Land,  Alf-heinner;  commonly  appearing  on  earth  at  intervals&#x2014;when  they  left  traces  of  their <br/>visits,  in  beautiful  green-rings,  where  the  dewy  sward  had  been  trodden  in  their  moonlight  dances.&quot; <br/><br/>To  the  sylphs  the  ancients  gave  the  labor  of  modeling  the  snowflakes  and  gathering  clouds.  This  latter <br/>they  accomplished  with  the  cooperation  of  the  undines  who  supplied  the  moisture.  The  winds  were <br/>their  particular  vehicle  and  the  ancients  referred  to  them  as  the  spirits  of  the  air.  They  are  the  highest <br/>of  all  the  elementals,  their  native  element  being  the  highest  in  vibratory  rate.  They  live  hundreds  of <br/>years,  often  attaining  to  a  thousand  years  and  never  seeming  to  grow  old.  The  leader  of  the  sylphs  is <br/>called  Paralda,  who  is  said  to  dwell  on  the  highest  mountain  of  the  earth.  The  female  sylphs  were <br/>called  sylphids. <br/><br/>It  is  believed  that  the  sylphs,  salamanders,  and  nymphs  had  much  to  do  with  the  oracles  of  the <br/>ancients;  that  in  fact  they  were  the  ones  who  spoke  from  the  depths  of  the  earth  and  from  the  air <br/>above. <br/><br/>The  sylphs  sometimes  assume  human  form,  but  apparently  for  only  short  periods  of  time.  Their  size <br/>varies,  but  in  the  majority  of  cases  they  are  no  larger  than  human  beings  and  often  considerably <br/>smaller.  It  is  said  that  the  sylphs  have  accepted  human  beings  into  their  communities  and  have <br/>permitted  them  to  live  there  for  a  considerable  period;  in  fact,  Paracelsus  wrote  of  such  an  incident, <br/>but  of  course  it  could  not  have  occurred  while  the  human  stranger  was  in  his  physical  body.  By  some, <br/>the  Muses  of  the  Greeks  are  believed  to  have  been  sylphs,  for  these  spirits  are  said  to  gather  around <br/>the  mind  of  the  dreamer,  the  poet,  and  the  artist,  and  inspire  him  with  their  intimate  knowledge  of <br/>the  beauties  and  workings  of  Nature.  To  the  sylphs  were  given  the  eastern  corner  of  creation.  Their <br/>temperament  is  mirthful,  changeable,  and  eccentric.  The  peculiar  qualities  common  to  men  of  genius <br/>are  supposedly  the  result  of  the  cooperation  of  sylphs,  whose  aid  also  brings  with  it  the  sylphic <br/>inconsistency.  The  sylphs  labor  with  the  gases  of  the  human  body  and  indirectly  with  the  nervous <br/>system,  where  their  inconstancy  is  again  apparent.  They  have  no  fixed  domicile,  but  wander  about <br/>from  place  to  place&#x2014;elemental  nomads,  invisible  but  ever-present  powers  in  the  intelligent  activity  of <br/>the  universe. <br/><br/><br/>GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS <br/><br/><br/>Certain  of  the  ancients,  differing  with  Paracelsus,  shared  the  opinion  that  the  elemental  kingdoms <br/>were  capable  of  waging  war  upon  one  another,  and  they  recognized  in  the  battlings  of  the  elements <br/>disagreements  among  these  kingdoms  of  Nature  spirits.  When  lightning  struck  a  rock  and  splintered <br/>it,  they  believed  that  the  salamanders  were  attacking  the  gnomes.  As  they  could  not  attack  one <br/>another  on  the  plane  of  their  own  peculiar  etheric  essences,  owing  to  the  fact  that  there  was  no <br/>vibratory  correspondence  between  the  four  ethers  of  which  these  kingdoms  are  composed,  they  had <br/>to  attack  through  a  common  denominator,  namely,  the  material  substance  of  the  physical  universe <br/>over  which  they  had  a  certain  amount  of  power. <br/><br/>Wars  were  also  fought  within  the  groups  themselves;  one  army  of  gnomes  would  attack  another  army, <br/>and  civil  war  would  be  rife  among  them.  Philosophers  of  long  ago  solved  the  problems  of  Nature's <br/>apparent  inconsistencies  by  individualizing  and  personifying  all  its  forces,  crediting  them  with  having <br/>temperaments  not  unlike  the  human  and  then  expecting  them  to  exhibit  typical  human <br/>inconsistencies.  The  four  fixed  signs  of  the  zodiac  were  assigned  to  the  four  kingdoms  of  elementals. <br/>The  gnomes  were  said  to  be  of  the  nature  of  Taurus;  the  undines,  of  the  nature  of  Scorpio;  the <br/>salamanders  exemplified  the  constitution  of  Leo;  while  the  sylphs  manipulated  the  emanations  of <br/>Aquarius. <br/><br/>The  Christian  Church  gathered  all  the  elemental  entities  together  under  the  title  of  demon.  This  is  a <br/>misnomer  with  far-reaching  consequences,  for  to  the  average  mind  the  word  demon  means  an  evil <br/>thing,  and  the  Nature  spirits  are  essentially  no  more  malevolent  than  are  the  minerals,  plants,  and <br/>animals.  Many  of  the  early  Church  Fathers  asserted  that  they  had  met  and  debated  with  the <br/>elementals. <br/><br/>As  already  stated,  the  Nature  spirits  are  without  hope  of  immortality,  although  some  philosophers <br/>have  maintained  that  in  isolated  cases  immortality  was  conferred  upon  them  by  adepts  and  initiates <br/>who  understood  certain  subtle  principles  of  the  invisible  world.  As  disintegration  takes  place  in  the <br/>physical  world,  so  it  takes  place  in  the  ethereal  counterpart  of  physical  substance.  Under  normal <br/>conditions  at  death,  a  Nature  spirit  is  merely  resolved  back  into  the  transparent  primary  essence  from <br/>which  it  was  originally  individualized.  Whatever  evolutionary  growth  is  made  is  recorded  solely  in  the <br/>consciousness  of  that  primary  essence,  or  element,  and  not  in  the  temporarily  individualized  entity  of <br/>the  elemental.  Being  without  man's  compound  organism  and  lacking  his  spiritual  and  intellectual <br/>vehicles,  the  Nature  spirits  are  subhuman  in  their  rational  intelligence,  but  from  their  functions- <br/>limited  to  one  element &#x2014;has  resulted  a  specialized  type  of  intelligence  far  ahead  of  man  in  those  lines <br/>of  research  peculiar  to  the  element  in  which  they  exist. <br/><br/>The  terms  incubus  and  succubus  have  been  applied  indiscriminately  by  the  Church  Fathers  to <br/>elementals.  The  incubus  and  succubus,  however,  are  evil  and  unnatural  creations,  whereas  elementals <br/>is  a  collective  term  for  all  the  inhabitants  of  the  four  elemental  essences.  According  to  Paracelsus,  the <br/>incubus  and  succubus  (which  are  male  and  female  respectively)  are  parasitical  creatures  subsisting <br/>upon  the  evil  thoughts  and  emotions  of  the  astral  body.  These  terms  are  also  applied  to  the <br/>superphysical  organisms  of  sorcerers  and  black  magicians.  While  these  larvae  are  in  no  sense <br/>imaginary  beings,  they  are,  nevertheless,  the  offspring  of  the  imagination.  By  the  ancient  sages  they <br/>were  recognized  as  the  invisible  cause  of  vice  because  they  hover  in  the  ethers  surrounding  the <br/>morally  weak  and  continually  incite  them  to  excesses  of  a  degrading  nature.  For  this  reason  they <br/>frequent  the  atmosphere  of  the  dope  den,  the  dive,  and  the  brothel,  where  they  attach  themselves  to <br/>those  unfortunates  who  have  given  themselves  up  to  iniquity.  By  permitting  his  senses  to  become <br/>deadened  through  indulgence  in  habit-forming  drugs  or  alcoholic  stimulants,  the  individual  becomes <br/>temporarily  en  rapport  with  these  denizens  of  the  astral  plane.  The  houris  seen  by  the  hasheesh  or <br/>opium  addict  and  the  lurid  monsters  which  torment  the  victim  of  delirium  tremens  are  examples  of <br/>submundane  beings,  visible  only  to  those  whose  evil  practices  are  the  magnet  for  their  attraction. <br/><br/><br/>Differing  widely  from  the  elementals  and  also  the  incubus  and  succubus  is  the  vampire,  which  is <br/>defined  by  Paracelsus  as  the  astral  body  of  a  person  either  living  or  dead  (usually  the  latter  state).  The <br/>vampire  seeks  to  prolong  existence  upon  the  physical  plane  by  robbing  the  living  of  their  vital <br/>energies  and  misappropriating  such  energies  to  its  own  ends. <br/><br/>In  his  De  Ente  Spirituali  Paracelsus  writes  thus  of  these  malignant  beings:  &quot;A  healthy  and  pure <br/>person  cannot  become  obsessed  by  them,  because  such  Larvae  can  only  act  upon  men  if  the  later  make <br/>room  for  them  in  their  minds.  A  healthy  mind  is  a  castle  that  cannot  be  invaded  without  the  will  of  its <br/>master;  but  if  they  are  allowed  to  enter,  they  excite  the  passions  of  men  and  women,  they  create <br/>cravings  in  them,  they  produce  bad  thoughts  which  act  injuriously  upon  the  brain;  they  sharpen  the <br/>animal  intellect  and  suffocate  the  moral  sense.  Evil  spirits  obsess  only  those  human  beings  in  whom <br/>the  animal  nature  is  predominating.  Minds  that  are  illuminated  by  the  spirit  of  truth  cannot  be <br/>possessed;  only  those  who  are  habitually  guided  by  their  own  lower  impulses  may  become  subjected <br/>to  their  influences.&quot;  (See  Paracelsus,  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>A  strange  concept,  and  one  somewhat  at  variance  with  the  conventional,  is  that  evolved  by  the  Count <br/>de  Gabalis  concerning  the  immaculate  conception,  namely,  that  it  represents  the  union  of  a  human <br/>being  with  an  elemental.  Among  the  offspring  of  such  unions  he  lists  Hercules,  Achilles,  -^neas, <br/>Theseus,  Melchizedek,  the  divine  Plato,  ApoUonius  of  Tyana,  and  Merlin  the  Magician. <br/><br/><br/>A  SYLPH. <br/><br/>From  sketch  by  Howard  Wookey. <br/><br/>The  sylphs  were  changeable  entities,  passing  to  and  fro  with  the  rapidity  of  lightning.  They  work  through  the  gases  and <br/>ethers  of  the  earth  and  are  kindly  disposed  toward  human  beings.  They  are  nearly  always  represented  as  winged, <br/>sometimes  as  tiny  cherubs  and  at  other  times  as  delicate  fairies. <br/><br/><br/>p.  109 <br/><br/><br/>Hermetic  Pharmacology,  Chemistry,  and <br/><br/>Therapeutics <br/><br/>THE  art  of  healing  was  originally  one  of  the  secret  sciences  of  the  priestcraft,  and  the  mystery  of  its <br/>source  is  obscured  by  the  same  veil  which  hides  the  genesis  of  religious  belief.  All  higher  forms  of <br/>knowledge  were  originally  in  the  possession  of  the  sacerdotal  castes.  The  temple  was  the  cradle  of <br/>civilization.  The  priests,  exercising  their  divine  prerogative,  made  the  laws  and  enforced  them; <br/>appointed  the  rulers  and  controlled  than;  ministered  to  the  needs  of  the  living,  and  guided  the <br/>destinies  of  the  dead.  All  branches  of  learning  were  monopolized  by  the  priesthood,  who  admitted <br/>into  their  ranks  only  those  intellectually  and  morally  qualified  to  perpetuate  their  arcanum.  The <br/>following  quotation  from  Plato's  Statesman  is  apropos  of  the  subject: &quot;  *  *  *  in  Egypt,  the  King <br/>himself  is  not  allowed  to  reign,  unless  he  have  priestly  powers;  and  if  he  should  be  one  of  another <br/>class,  and  have  obtained  the  throne  by  violence,  he  must  get  enrolled  in  the  priestcraft.&quot; <br/><br/>Candidates  aspiring  to  membership  in  the  religious  orders  underwent  severe  tests  to  prove  their <br/>worthiness.  These  ordeals  were  called  initiations.  Those  who  passed  them  successfully  were <br/>welcomed  as  brothers  by  the  priests  and  were  instructed  in  the  secret  teachings.  Among  the  ancients, <br/>philosophy,  science,  and  religion  were  never  considered  as  separate  units:  each  was  regarded  as  an <br/>integral  part  of  the  whole.  Philosophy  was  scientific  and  religious;  science  was  philosophic  and <br/>religious  I  religion  was  philosophic  and  scientific.  Perfect  wisdom  was  considered  unattainable  save <br/>as  the  result  of  harmonizing  all  three  of  these  expressions  of  mental  and  moral  activity. <br/><br/>While  modern  physicians  accredit  Hippocrates  with  being  the  father  of  medicine,  the  ancient <br/>therapeutae  ascribed  to  the  immortal  Hermes  the  distinction  of  being  the  founder  of  the  art  of  healing. <br/>Clemens  Alexandrinus,  in  describing  the  books  purported  to  be  from  the  stylus  of  Hermes,  divided <br/>the  sacred  writings  into  six  general  classifications,  one  of  which,  the  Pastophorus,  was  devoted  to  the <br/>science  of  medicine.  The  Smaragdine,  or  Emerald  Tablet  found  in  the  valley  of  Ebron  and  generally <br/>accredited  to  Hermes,  is  in  reality  a  chemical  formula  of  a  high  and  secret  order. <br/><br/>Hippocrates,  the  famous  Greek  physician,  during  the  fifth  century  before  Christ,  dissociated  the <br/>healing  art  from  the  other  sciences  of  the  temple  and  thereby  established  a  precedent  for  separateness. <br/>One  of  the  consequences  is  the  present  widespread  crass  scientific  materialism.  The  ancients  realized <br/>the  interdependence  of  the  sciences.  The  moderns  do  not;  and  as  a  result,  incomplete  systems  of <br/>learning  are  attempting  to  maintain  isolated  individualism.  The  obstacles  which  confront  present-day <br/>scientific  research  are  largely  the  result  of  prejudicial  limitations  imposed  by  those  who  are  unwilling <br/>to  accept  that  which  transcends  the  concrete  perceptions  of  the  five  primary  human  senses. <br/><br/>THE  PARACELSIAN  SYSTEM  OF  MEDICAL  PHILOSOPHY <br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages  the  long -ignored  axioms  and  formulae  of  Hermetic  wisdom  were  assembled <br/>once  more,  and  chronicled,  and  systematic  attempts  were  made  to  test  their  accuracy.  To <br/>Theophrastus  of  Hohenheim,  who  called  himself  Paracelsus  (a  name  meaning  &quot;greater  than  Celsus&quot;), <br/>the  world  is  indebted  for  much  of  the  knowledge  it  now  possesses  of  the  ancient  systems  of  medicine. <br/>Paracelsus  devoted  his  entire  life  to  the  study  and  exposition  of  Hermetic  philosophy.  Every  notion <br/>and  theory  was  grist  to  his  mill,  and,  while  members  of  the  medical  fraternity  belittle  his  memory  now <br/>as  they  opposed  his  system  then,  the  occult  world  knows  that  he  will  yet  be  recognized  as  the  greatest <br/>physician  of  all  times.  While  the  heterodox  and  exotic  temperament  of  Paracelsus  has  been  held <br/>against  him  by  his  enemies,  and  his  wanderlust  has  been  called  vagabondage,  he  was  one  of  the  few <br/><br/><br/>minds  who  intelligently  sought  to  reconcile  the  art  of  healing  with  the  philosophic  and  religious <br/>systems  of  paganism  and  Christianity. <br/><br/>In  defending  his  right  to  seek  knowledge  in  all  parts  of  the  earth,  and  among  all  classes  of  society, <br/>Paracelsus  wrote:  &quot;Therefore  I  consider  that  it  is  for  me  a  matter  of  praise,  not  of  blame,  that  I  have <br/>hitherto  and  worthily  pursued  my  wanderings.  For  this  will  I  bear  witness  respecting  nature:  he  who <br/>will  investigate  her  ways  must  travel  her  books  with  his  feet.  That  which  is  written  is  investigated <br/>through  its  letters,  but  nature  from  land  to  land-as  often  a  land  so  often  a  leaf.  Thus  is  the  Codex  of <br/>Nature,  thus  must  its  leaves  be  turned.&quot;  (Paracelsus,  by  John  Maxson  Stillman.) <br/><br/>Paracelsus  was  a  great  observationalist,  and  those  who  knew  him  best  have  called  him  &quot;The  Second <br/>Hermes&quot;  and  &quot;The  Trismegistus  of  Switzerland.&quot;  He  traveled  Europe  from  end  to  end,  and  may  have <br/>penetrated  Eastern  lands  while  running  down  superstitions  and  ferreting  out  supposedly  lost <br/>doctrines.  From  the  gypsies  he  learned  much  concerning  the  uses  of  simples,  and  apparently  from  the <br/>Arabians  concerning  the  making  of  talismans  and  the  influences  of  the  heavenly  bodies.  Paracelsus <br/>felt  that  the  healing  of  the  sick  was  of  far  greater  importance  than  the  maintaining  of  an  orthodox <br/>medical  standing,  so  he  sacrificed  what  might  otherwise  have  been  a  dignified  medical  career  and  at <br/>the  cost  of  lifelong  persecution  bitterly  attacked  the  therapeutic  systems  of  his  day. <br/><br/>Uppermost  in  his  mind  was  the  hypothesis  that  everything  in  the  universe  is  good  for  something&#x2014; <br/>which  accounts  for  his  cutting  fungus  from  tombstones  and  collecting  dew  on  glass  plates  at  midnight. <br/>He  was  a  true  explorer  of  Nature's  arcanum.  Many  authorities  have  held  the  opinion  that  he  was  the <br/>discoverer  of  mesmerism,  and  that  Mesmer  evolved  the  art  as  the  result  of  studying  the  writings  of <br/>this  great  Swiss  physician. <br/><br/>The  utter  contempt  which  Paracelsus  felt  for  the  narrow  systems  of  medicine  in  vogue  during  his <br/>lifetime,  and  his  conviction  of  their  inadequacy,  are  best  expressed  in  his  own  quaint  way:  &quot;But  the <br/>number  of  diseases  that  originate  from  some  unknown  causes  is  far  greater  than  those  that  come <br/>from  mechanical  causes,  and  for  such  diseases  our  physicians  know  no  cure  because  not  knowing <br/>such  causes  they  cannot  remove  them.  All  they  can  prudently  do  is  to  observe  the  patient  and  make <br/>their  guesses  about  his  condition;  and  the  patient  may  rest  satisfied  if  the  medicines  administered  to <br/>him  do  no  serious  harm,  and  do  not  prevent  his  recovery.  The  best  of  our  popular  physicians  are  the <br/>ones  that  do  least  harm.  But,  unfortunately,  some  poison  their  patients  with  mercury,  others  purge <br/>them  or  bleed  them  to  death.  There  are  some  who  have  learned  so  much  that  their  learning  has  driven <br/>out  all  their  common  sense,  and  a  there  are  others  who  care  a  great:  deal  more  for  their  own  profit <br/>than  for  the  health  of  their  patients.  A  disease  does  not  change  its  state  to  accommodate  itself  to  the <br/>knowledge  of  the  physician,  but  the  physician  should  understand  the  causes  of  the  disease.  A <br/>physician  should  be  a  servant  of  Nature,  and  not  her  enemy;  he  should  be  able  to  guide  and  direct  her <br/>in  her  struggle  for  life  and  not  throw,  by  his  unreasonable  interference,  fresh  obstacles  in  the  way  of <br/>recovery.&quot;  (From  the  Paragranum,  translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>The  belief  that  nearly  all  diseases  have  their  origin  in  the  invisible  nature  of  man  (the  Astrum)  is  a <br/>fundamental  precept  of  Hermetic  medicine,  for  while  Hermetists  in  no  way  disregarded  the  physical <br/>body,  they  believed  that  man's  material  constitution  was  an  emanation  from,  or  an  objectification  of, <br/>his  invisible  spiritual  principles.  A  brief,  but  it  is  believed  fairly  comprehensive,  resume  of  the <br/>Hermetic  principles  of  Paracelsus  follows. <br/><br/><br/>LAPDDE  PHn:OSO' <br/><br/>PHICO <br/>PERBREVE  OPUS. <br/><br/>CULUM. <br/><br/>QUOD  AB  IGNOTO  ALlQUO  GEB* <br/><br/><br/>THE  TITLE  PAGE  OF  THE  BOOK  OF  ALZE. <br/><br/>From  Miisaeum  Hermeticum  Reformatum  et  Amplificatum. <br/><br/>This  title  page  is  a  further  example  of  Hermetic  and  alchemical  symbolism.  The  seven-pointed  star  of  the  sacred  metals  is <br/>arranged  that  one  black  point  is  downward,  thus  symbolizing  Saturn,  the  Destroyer.  Beginning  in  the  space  immediately <br/>to  the  left  of  the  black  point,  reading  clockwise  discloses  the  cryptic  word  VITRIOL  formed  by  the  capital  letters  of  the <br/>seven  Latin  words  in  the  outer  circle. <br/><br/>p.  110 <br/><br/>There  is  one  vital  substance  in  Nature  upon  which  all  things  subsist.  It  is  called  archseus,  or  vital  life <br/>force,  and  is  synonymous  with  the  astral  light  or  spiritual  air  of  the  ancients.  In  regard  to  this <br/>substance,  Eliphas  Levi  has  written:  &quot;Light,  that  creative  agent,  the  vibrations  of  which  are  the <br/>movement  and  life  of  all  things;  light,  latent  in  the  universal  ether,  radiating  about  absorbing  centres, <br/>which,  being  saturated  thereby,  project  movement  and  life  in  their  turn,  so  forming  creative  currents; <br/>light,  astralized  in  the  stars,  animalized  in  animals,  humanized  in  human  beings;  light,  which <br/>vegetates  all  plants,  glistens  in  metals,  produces  all  forms  of  Nature  and  equilibrates  all  by  the  laws  of <br/>universal  sympathy&#x2014;this  is  the  light  which  exhibits  the  phenomena  of  magnetism,  divined  by <br/>Paracelsus,  which  tinctures  the  blood,  being  released  from  the  air  as  it  is  inhaled  and  discharged  by <br/>the  hermetic  bellows  of  the  lungs.&quot;  (The  History  of  Magic.) <br/><br/>This  vital  energy  has  its  origin  in  the  spiritual  body  of  the  earth.  Every  created  thing  has  two  bodies, <br/>one  visible  and  substantial,  the  other  invisible  and  transcendent.  The  latter  consists  of  an  ethereal <br/>counterpart  of  the  physical  form;  it  constitutes  the  vehicle  of  archaeus,  and  may  be  called  a  vital  body. <br/>This  etheric  shadow  sheath  is  not  dissipated  by  death,  but  remains  until  the  physical  form  is  entirely <br/>disintegrated.  These  &quot;etheric  doubles,  &quot;seen  around  graveyards,  have  given  rise  to  a  belief  in  ghosts. <br/>Being  much  finer  in  its  substances  than  the  earthly  body,  the  etheric  double  is  far  more  susceptible  to <br/>impulses  and  inharmonies.  It  is  derangements  of  this  astral  light  body  that  cause  much  disease. <br/>Paracelsus  taught  that  a  person  with  a  morbid  mental  attitude  could  poison  his  own  etheric  nature, <br/>and  this  infection,  diverting  the  natural  flow  of  vital  life  force,  would  later  appear  as  a  physical <br/><br/><br/>ailment.  All  plants  and  minerals  have  an  invisible  nature  composed  of  this  &quot;archaeus,&quot;  but  each <br/>manifests  it  in  a  different  way. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  astral-light  bodies  of  flowers,  James  Gaffarel,  in  1650,  wrote  the  following:  &quot;I  answer, <br/>that  though  they  be  chopt  in  pieces,  brayed  in  a  Mortar,  and  even  burnt  to  Ashes;  yet  do  they <br/>neverthelesse  retaine,  (by  a  certaine  Secret,  and  wonderfuU  Power  of  Nature),  both  in  the  Juyce,  and <br/>in  the  Ashes,  the  selfe  same  Forme,  and  Figure,  that  they  had  before:  and  though  it  be  not  there <br/>Visible,  yet  it  may  by  Art  be  drawne  forth,  and  made  Visible  to  the  Eye,  by  an  Artist.  This  perhaps  will <br/>seem  a  Ridiculous  story  to  those,  who  reade  only  the  Titles  of  Bookes:  but,  those  that  please,  may  see <br/>this  truth  confirmed,  if  they  but  have  recourse  to  the  Workes  of  M.  du  Chesne,  S.  de  la  Violette,  one  of <br/>the  best  Chymists  that  our  Age  hath  produced;  who  affirmes,  that  himselfe  saw  an  Excellent  Polich <br/>Physician  of  Cracovia,  who  kept,  in  Glasses,  the  Ashes  of  almost  all  the  Hearbs  that  are  knowne:  so <br/>that,  when  any  one,  out  of  Curiosity,  had  a  desire  to  see  any  of  them,  as  (for  example)  a  Rose,  in  one <br/>of  his  Glasses,  he  tooke  That  where  the  Ashes  of  a  Rose  were  preserved;  and  holding  it  over  a  lighted <br/>Candle,  so  soone  as  it  ever  began  to  feele  the  Heat,  you  should  presently  see  the  Ashes  begin  to  Move; <br/>which  afterwards  rising  up,  and  dispersing  themselves  about  the  Glasse,  you  should  immediately <br/>observe  a  kind  of  little  Dark  Cloud;  which  dividing  it  selfe  into  many  parts,  it  came  at  length  to <br/>represent  a  Rose;  but  so  Faire,  so  Fresh,  and  so  Perfect  a  one,  that  you  would  have  thought  it  to  have <br/>been  as  Substancial,  &amp;  as  Odoriferous  a  Rose,  as  growes  on  the  Rose-tree.&quot;  {Unheard-of  Curiosities <br/>Concerning  Talismanical  Sculpture  of  the  Persians.) <br/><br/>Paracelsus,  recognizing  derangements  of  the  etheric  double  as  the  most  important  cause  of  disease, <br/>sought  to  reharmonize  its  substances  by  bringing  into  contact  with  it  other  bodies  whose  vital  energy <br/>could  supply  elements  needed,  or  were  strong  enough  to  overcome  the  diseased  conditions  existing  in <br/>the  aura  of  the  sufferer.  Its  invisible  cause  having  been  thus  removed,  the  ailment  speedily  vanished. <br/><br/>The  vehicle  for  the  archaeus,  or  vital  life  force,  Paracelsus  called  the  mumia.  A  good  example  of  a <br/>physical  mumia  is  vaccine,  which  is  the  vehicle  of  a  semi-astral  virus.  Anything  which  serves  as  a <br/>medium  for  the  transmission  of  the  archgeus,  whether  it  be  organic  or  inorganic,  truly  physical  or <br/>partly  spiritualized,  was  termed  a  mumia.  The  most  universal  form  of  the  mumia  was  ether,  which <br/>modern  science  has  accepted  as  a  hypothetical  substance  serving  as  a  medium  between  the  realm  of <br/>vital  energy  and  that  of  organic  and  inorganic  substance. <br/><br/>The  control  of  universal  energy  is  virtually  impossible,  save  through  one  of  its  vehicles  (the  mumia).  A <br/>good  example  of  this  is  food.  Man  does  not  secure  nourishment  from  dead  animal  or  plant  organisms, <br/>but  when  he  incorporates  their  structures  into  his  own  body  he  first  gains  control  over  the  mumia,  or <br/>etheric  double,  of  the  animal  or  plant.  Having  obtained  this  control,  the  human  organism  then  diverts <br/>the  flow  of  the  archaeus  to  its  own  uses.  Paracelsus  says:  &quot;That  which  constitutes  life  is  contained  in <br/>the  Mumia,  and  by  imparting  the  Mumia  we  impart  life.&quot;  This  is  the  secret  of  the  remedial  properties <br/>of  talismans  and  amulets,  for  the  mumia  of  the  substances  of  which  they  are  composed  serves  as  a <br/>channel  to  connect  the  person  wearing  them  with  certain  manifestations  of  the  universal  vital  life <br/>force. <br/><br/>According  to  Paracelsus,  in  the  same  way  that  plants  purify  the  atmosphere  by  accepting  into  their <br/>constitutions  the  carbon  dioxid  exhaled  by  animals  and  humans,  so  may  plants  and  animals  accept <br/>disease  elements  transferred  to  them  by  human  beings.  These  lower  forms  of  life,  having  organisms <br/>and  needs  different  from  man,  are  often  able  to  assimilate  these  substances  without  ill  effect.  At  other <br/>times,  the  plant  or  animal  dies,  sacrificed  in  order  that  the  more  intelligent,  and  consequently  more <br/>useful,  creature  may  survive.  Paracelsus  discovered  that  in  either  case  the  patient  was  gradually <br/>relieved  of  his  malady.  When  the  lower  life  had  either  completely  assimilated  the  foreign  mumia  from <br/>the  patient,  or  had  itself  died  and  disintegrated  as  the  result  of  its  inability  to  do  so,  complete  recovery <br/>resulted.  Many  years  of  investigation  were  necessary  to  determine  which  herb  or  animal  most  readily <br/>accepted  the  mumia  of  each  of  various  diseases. <br/><br/><br/>Paracelsus  discovered  that  in  many  cases  plants  revealed  by  their  shape  the  particular  organs  of  the <br/>human  body  which  they  served  most  effectively.  The  medical  system  of  Paracelsus  was  based  on  the <br/>theory  that  by  removing  the  diseased  etheric  mumia  from  the  organism  of  the  patient  and  causing  it <br/>to  be  accepted  into  the  nature  of  some  distant  and  disinterested  thing  of  comparatively  little  value,  it <br/>was  possible  to  divert  from  the  patient  the  flow  of  the  archaeus  which  had  been  continually <br/>revitalizing  and  nourishing  the  malady.  Its  vehicle  of  expression  being  transplanted,  the  archaeus <br/>necessarily  accompanied  its  mumia,  and  the  patient  recovered. <br/><br/>THE  HERMETIC  THEORY  CONCERNING  THE  CAUSATIONS  OF  DISEASE <br/><br/>According  to  the  Hermetic  philosophers,  there  were  seven  primary  causes  of  disease.  The  first  was <br/>evil  spirits.  These  were  regarded  as  creatures  born  of  degenerate  actions,  subsisting  on  the  vital <br/>energies  of  those  to  whom  they  attached  themselves.  The  second  cause  was  a  derangement  of  the <br/>spiritual  nature  and  the  material  nature:  these  two,  failing  to  coordinate,  produced <br/><br/><br/>JOHANNIS  BAPnSTAE  VON  HELMONT. <br/><br/><br/>From  von  Helmont's  Ausgang  der  Artznen-Kunst. <br/><br/><br/>At  the  beginning  of  the  seventeenth  century  von  Helmont,  the  Belgian  alchemist  (to  v\rhom  incidentally,  the  world  is <br/>indebted  for  the  common  term  gas,  as  distinguished  from  other  kinds  of  air),  while  experimenting  with  the  root  of  A &#x2014; , <br/>touched  it  to  the  tip  of  his  tongue,  without  swallowing  any  of  the  substance.  He  himself  describes  the  result  in  the <br/>following  manner: <br/><br/>&quot;Immediately  my  head  seemed  tied  tightly  with  a  string,  and  soon  after  there  happened  to  me  a  singular  circumstance <br/>such  as  I  had  never  before  experienced.  I  observed  with  astonishment  that  I  no  longer  felt  and  thought  with  the  head,  but <br/><br/><br/>with  the  region  of  the  stomach,  as  if  consciousness  had  now  taken  up  its  seat  in  the  stomach.  Terrified  by  this  unusual <br/>phenomenon,  I  asked  myself  and  inquired  into  myself  carefully;  but  I  only  became  the  more  convinced  that  my  power  of <br/>perception  was  became  greater  and  more  comprehensive.  This  intellectual  clearness  was  associated  with  great  pleasure.  I <br/>did  not  sleep,  nor  did  I  dream;  I  was  perfectly  sober;  and  my  health  was  perfect.  I  had  occasionally  had  ecstasies,  but  these <br/>had  nothing  in  common  with  this  condition  of  the  stomach,  in  which  it  thought  and  felt,  and  almost  excluded  all <br/>cooperation  of  the  head.  In  the  meantime  my  friends  were  troubled  with  the  fear  that  I  might  go  mad.  But  my  faith  to  God, <br/>and  my  submission  to  His  will,  soon  dissipated  this  fear.  This  state  continued  for  two  hours,  after  which  I  had  same <br/>dizziness.  I  afterwards  frequently  tasted  of  the  A &#x2014; ,  but  I  never  again  could  reproduce  these  sensations.&quot;  (Van  Helmont, <br/>Demens  idea.  Reprinted  by  P.  Davidson  in  The  Mistletoe  and  Its  Philosophy.) <br/><br/>Von  Helmont  is  only  one  of  many  who  have  accidentally  hit  upon  the  secrets  of  the  early  priestcrafts,  but  none  in  this  age <br/>give  evidence  of  an  adequate  comprehension  of  the  ancient  Hermetic  secrets.  From  the  description  von  Helmont  gives,  it <br/>is  probable  that  the  herb  mentioned  by  him  paralyzed  temporarily  the  cerebrospinal  nervous  system,  the  result  being  that <br/>the  consciousness  was  forced  to  function  through  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and  its  brain&#x2014;the  solar  plexus. <br/><br/>p.  1111 <br/><br/>mental  and  physical  subnormality.  The  third  was  an  unhealthy  or  abnormal  mental  attitude. <br/><br/>Melancholia,  morbid  emotions,  excess  of  feeling,  such  as  passions,  lusts,  greeds,  and  hates,  affected <br/>the  mumia,  from  which  they  reacted  into  the  physical  body,  where  they  resulted  in  ulcers,  tumors, <br/>cancers,  fevers,  and  tuberculosis.  The  ancients  viewed  the  disease  germ  as  a  unit  of  mumia  which  had <br/>been  impregnated  with  the  emanations  from  evil  influences  which  it  had  contacted.  In  other  words, <br/>germs  were  minute  creatures  born  out  of  man's  evil  thoughts  and  actions. <br/><br/>The  fourth  cause  of  disease  was  what  the  Orientals  called  Karma,  that  is,  the  Law  of  Compensation, <br/>which  demanded  that  the  individual  pay  in  full  for  the  indiscretions  and  delinquencies  of  the  past.  A <br/>physician  had  to  be  very  careful  how  he  interfered  with  the  workings  of  this  law,  lest  he  thwart  the <br/>plan  of  Eternal  justice.  The  fifth  cause  was  the  motion  and  aspects  of  the  heavenly  bodies.  The  stars <br/>did  not  compel  the  sickness  but  rather  impelled  it.  The  Hermetists  taught  that  a  strong  and  wise  man <br/>ruled  his  stars,  but  that  a  negative,  weak  person  was  ruled  by  them.  These  five  causes  of  disease  are  all <br/>superphysical  in  nature.  They  must  be  estimated  by  inductive  and  deductive  reasoning  and  a  careful <br/>consideration  of  the  life  and  temperament  of  the  patient. <br/><br/>The  sixth  cause  of  disease  was  a  misuse  of  faculty,  organ,  or  function,  such  as  overstraining  a <br/>member  or  overtaxing  the  nerves.  The  seventh  cause  was  the  presence  in  the  system  of  foreign <br/>substances,  impurities,  or  obstructions.  Under  this  heading  must  be  considered  diet,  air,  sunlight, <br/>and  the  presence  of  foreign  bodies.  This  list  does  not  include  accidental  injuries;  such  do  not  belong <br/>under  the  heading  of  disease.  Frequently  they  are  methods  by  which  the  Law  of  Karma  expresses <br/>itself. <br/><br/>According  to  the  Hermetists,  disease  could  be  prevented  or  successfully  combated  in  seven  ways.  First, <br/>by  spells  and  invocations,  in  which  the  physician  ordered  the  evil  spirit  causing  the  disease  to  depart <br/>from  the  patient.  This  procedure  was  probably  based  on  the  Biblical  account  of  the  man  possessed  of <br/>devils  whom  Jesus  healed  by  commanding  the  devils  to  leave  the  man  and  enter  into  a  herd  of  swine. <br/>Sometimes  the  evil  spirits  entered  a  patient  at  the  bidding  of  someone  desiring  to  injure  him.  In  these <br/>cases  the  physician  commanded  the  spirits  to  return  to  the  one  who  sent  them.  It  is  recorded  that  in <br/>some  instances  the  evil  spirits  departed  through  the  mouth  in  the  form  of  clouds  of  smoke;  sometimes <br/>from  the  nostrils  as  flames.  It  is  even  averred  that  the  spirits  might  depart  in  the  form  of  birds  and <br/>insects. <br/><br/>The  second  method  of  healing  was  by  vibration.  The  inharmonies  of  the  bodies  were  neutralized  by <br/>chanting  spells  and  intoning  the  sacred  names  or  by  playing  upon  musical  instruments  and  singing. <br/>Sometimes  articles  of  various  colors  were  exposed  to  the  sight  of  the  sick,  for  the  ancients  recognized, <br/>at  least  in  part,  the  principle  of  color  therapeutics,  now  in  the  process  of  rediscovery. <br/><br/><br/>The  third  method  was  with  the  aid  of  tahsmans,  charms,  and  amulets.  The  ancients  beUeved  that  the <br/>planets  controlled  the  functions  of  the  human  body  and  that  by  making  charms  out  of  different  metals <br/>they  could  combat  the  malignant  influences  of  the  various  stars.  Thus,  a  person  who  is  anaemic  lacks <br/>iron.  Iron  was  believed  to  be  under  the  control  of  Mars.  Therefore,  in  order  to  bring  the  influence  of <br/>Mars  to  the  sufferer,  around  his  neck  was  hung  a  talisman  made  of  iron  and  bearing  upon  it  certain <br/>secret  instructions  reputed  to  have  the  power  of  invoking  the  spirit  of  Mars.  If  there  was  too  much <br/>iron  in  the  system,  the  patient  was  subjected  to  the  influence  of  a  talisman  composed  of  the  metal <br/>corresponding  to  some  planet  having  an  antipathy  to  Mars.  This  influence  would  then  offset  the  Mars <br/>energy  and  thus  aid  in  restoring  normality. <br/><br/>The  fourth  method  was  by  the  aid  of  herbs  and  simples.  While  they  used  metal  talismans,  the <br/>majority  of  the  ancient  physicians  did  not  approve  of  mineral  medicine  in  any  form  for  internal  use. <br/>Herbs  were  their  favorite  remedies.  Like  the  metals,  each  herb  was  assigned  to  one  of  the  planets. <br/>Having  diagnosed  by  the  stars  the  sickness  and  its  cause,  the  doctors  then  administered  the  herbal <br/>antidote. <br/><br/>The  fifth  method  of  healing  disease  was  by  prayer.  All  ancient  peoples  believed  in  the  compassionate <br/>intercession  of  the  Deity  for  the  alleviation  of  human  suffering.  Paracelsus  said  that  faith  would  cure <br/>all  disease.  Few  persons,  however,  possess  a  sufficient  degree  of  faith. <br/><br/>The  sixth  method&#x2014;which  was  prevention  rather  than  cure&#x2014;was  regulation  of  the  diet  and  daily  habits <br/>of  life.  The  individual,  by  avoiding  the  things  which  caused  illness,  remained  well.  The  ancients <br/>believed  that  health  was  the  normal  state  of  man;  disease  was  the  result  of  man's  disregard  of  the <br/>dictates  of  Nature. <br/><br/>The  seventh  method  was  &quot;practical  medicine,&quot;  consisting  chiefly  of  bleeding,  purging,  and  similar <br/><br/>lines  of  treatment.  These  procedures,  while  useful  in  moderation,  were  dangerous  in  excess.  Many  a <br/>useful  citizen  has  died  twenty-five  or  fifty  years  before  his  time  as  the  result  of  drastic  purging  or  of <br/>having  all  the  blood  drained  out  of  his  body. <br/><br/>Paracelsus  used  all  seven  methods  of  treatment,  and  even  his  worst  enemies  admitted  that  he <br/>accomplished  results  almost  miraculous  in  character.  Near  his  old  estate  in  Hohenheim,  the  dew  falls <br/>very  heavily  at  certain  seasons  of  the  year,  and  Paracelsus  discovered  that  by  gathering  the  dew  under <br/>certain  configurations  of  the  planets  he  obtained  a  water  possessing  marvelous  medicinal  virtue,  for  it <br/>had  absorbed  the  properties  of  the  heavenly  bodies. <br/><br/>HERMETIC  HERBALISM  AND  PHARMACOLOGY <br/><br/>The  herbs  of  the  fields  were  sacred  to  the  early  pagans,  who  believed  that  the  gods  had  made  plants <br/><br/>for  the  cure  of  human  ills.  When  properly  prepared  and  applied,  each  root  and  shrub  could  be  used <br/>for  the  alleviation  of  suffering,  or  for  the  development  of  spiritual,  mental,  moral,  or  physical  powers. <br/>In  The  Mistletoe  and  Its  Philosophy,  P.  Davidson  pays  the  following  beautiful  tribute  to  the  plants: <br/>&quot;Books  have  been  written  on  the  language  of  flowers  and  herbs,  the  poet  from  the  earliest  ages  has <br/>held  the  sweetest  and  most  loving  converse  with  them,  kings  are  even  glad  to  obtain  their  essences  at <br/>second  hand  to  perfume  themselves;  but  to  the  true  physician&#x2014;Nature's  High-Priest&#x2014; they  speak  in  a <br/>far  higher  and  more  exalted  strain.  There  is  not  a  plant  or  mineral  which  has  disclosed  the  last  of  its <br/>properties  to  the  scientists.  How  can  they  feel  confident  that  for  every  one  of  the  discovered <br/>properties  there  may  not  be  many  powers  concealed  in  the  inner  nature  of  the  plant?  Well  have <br/>flowers  been  called  the  'Stars  of  Earth,'  and  why  should  they  not  be  beautiful?  Have  they  not  from  the <br/>time  of  their  birth  smiled  in  the  splendor  of  the  sun  by  day,  and  slumbered  under  the  brightness  of <br/>the  stars  by  night?  Have  they  not  come  from  another  and  more  spiritual  world  to  our  earth,  seeing <br/>that  God  made  'every  plant  of  the  field  BEFORE  it  was  in  the  earth,  and  every  herb  of  the  field <br/>BEFORE  IT  GREW?&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Many  primitive  peoples  used  herbal  remedies,  with  many  remarkable  cures.  The  Chinese,  Egyptians, <br/>and  American  Indians  cured  with  herbs  diseases  for  which  modern  science  knows  no  remedy.  Doctor <br/>Nicholas  Culpeper,  whose  useful  life  ended  in  1654,  was  probably  the  most  famous  of  herbalists. <br/>Finding  that  the  medical  systems  of  his  day  were  unsatisfactory  in  the  extreme,  Culpeper  turned  his <br/>attention  to  the  plants  of  the  fields,  and  discovered  a  medium  of  healing  which  gained  for  him <br/>national  renown. <br/><br/>In  Doctor  Culpeper's  correlation  of  astrology  and  herbalism,  each  plant  was  under  the  jurisdiction  of <br/>one  of  the  planets  or  luminaries.  He  believed  that  disease  was  also  controlled  by  celestial <br/>configurations.  He  summed  up  his  system  of  treatment  as  follows:  &quot;You  may  oppose  diseases  by <br/>Herbs  of  the  planet  opposite  to  the  planet  that  causes  them:  as  diseases  of  Jupiter  by  Herbs  of <br/>Mercury,  and  the  contrary;  diseases  of  the  Luminaries  by  the  Herbs  of  Saturn,  and  the  contrary; <br/>diseases  of  Mars  by  Herbs  of  Venus  and  the  contrary.  *  *  *  There  is  a  way  to  cure  diseases  sometimes <br/>by  Sympathy,  and  so  every  planet  cures  his  own  disease;  as  the  Sun  and  Moon  by  their  Herbs  cure  the <br/>Eyes,  Saturn  the  Spleen,  Jupiter  the  Liver,  Mars  the  Gall  and  diseases  of  choler,  and  Venus  diseases  in <br/>the  Instruments  of  Generation.&quot;  (The  Complete  Herbal.) <br/><br/>Mediseval  European  herbalists  rediscovered  only  in  part  the  ancient  Hermetic  secrets  of  Egypt  and <br/>Greece.  These  earlier  nations  evolved  the  fundamentals  of  nearly  all  modern  arcs  and  sciences. <br/><br/><br/>NICHOLAS  CULPEPER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Culpeper's  Semeiotica  Uranica. <br/><br/>This  famous  physician,  herbaUst,  and  astrologer  spent  the  greater  part  of  his  useful  life  ranging  the  hills  and  forests  of <br/>England  and  cataloguing  literally  hundreds  of  medicinal  herbs.  Condemning  the  unnatural  methods  of  contemporaneous <br/>medicos,  Culpeper  wrote:  &quot;This  not  being  pleasing,  and  less  profitable  tome,  I  consulted  with  my  two  brothers,  DR. <br/>REASON  and  DR.  EXPERIENCE,  and  took  a  voyage  to  visit  my  mother  NATURE,  by  whose  advice,  together  with  the  help <br/>of  Dr.  DILIGENCE,  I  at  last  obtained  my  desire;  and,  being  warned  by  MR.  HONESTY,  a  stranger  in  our  days,  to  publish  it <br/>to  the  world,  I  have  done  it.&quot;  (From  the  Introduction  to  the  1835  Edition  of  The  Complete  Herbal.)  Doctor  Johnson  said  of <br/>Culpeper  that  he  merited  the  gratitude  of  posterity. <br/><br/><br/>p.  112 <br/><br/><br/>At  that  time  the  methods  used  in  heahng  were  among  the  secrets  imparted  to  initiates  of  the <br/><br/>Mysteries.  Unctions,  collyria,  philters,  and  potions  were  concocted  to  the  accompaniment  of  strange <br/>rites.  The  effectiveness  of  these  medicines  is  a  matter  of  historical  record.  Incenses  and  perfumes <br/>were  also  much  used. <br/><br/>Barrett  in  his  Magus  describes  the  theory  on  which  they  worked,  as  follows:  &quot;For,  because  our  spirit  is <br/>the  pure,  subtil,  lucid,  airy  and  unctuous  vapour  of  the  blood,  nothing,  therefore,  is  better  adapted  for <br/>coUyriums  than  the  like  vapours  which  are  more  suitable  to  our  spirit  in  substance;  for  then,  by <br/>reason  of  their  likeness,  they  do  more  stir  up,  attract  and  transform  the  spirit.&quot; <br/><br/>Poisons  were  thoroughly  studied,  and  in  some  communities  extracts  of  deadly  herbs  were <br/>administered  to  persons  sentenced  to  death&#x2014;as  in  the  case  of  Socrates.  The  infamous  Borgias  of  Italy <br/>developed  the  art  of  poisoning  to  its  highest  degree.  Unnumbered  brilliant  men  and  women  were <br/>quietly  and  efficiently  disposed  of  by  the  almost  superhuman  knowledge  of  chemistry  which  for  many <br/>centuries  was  preserved  in  the  Borgia  family. <br/><br/>Egyptian  priests  discovered  herb  extracts  by  means  of  which  temporary  clairvoyance  could  be <br/>induced,  and  they  made  use  of  these  during  the  initiatory  rituals  of  their  Mysteries.  The  drugs  were <br/>sometimes  mixed  with  the  food  given  to  candidates,  and  at  other  times  were  presented  in  the  form  of <br/>sacred  potions,  the  nature  of  which  was  explained.  Shortly  after  the  drugs  were  administered  to  him, <br/>the  neophyte  was  attacked  by  a  spell  of  dizziness.  He  found  himself  floating  through  space,  and  while <br/>his  physical  body  was  absolutely  insensible  (being  guarded  by  priests  that  no  ill  should  befall  it)  the <br/>candidate  passed  through  a  number  of  weird  experiences,  which  he  was  able  to  relate  after  regaining <br/>consciousness.  In  the  light  of  present-day  knowledge,  it  is  difficult  to  appreciate  an  art  so  highly <br/>developed  that  by  means  of  draughts,  perfumes,  and  incenses  any  mental  attitude  desired  could  be <br/>induced  almost  instantaneously,  yet  such  an  art  actually  existed  among  the  priestcraft  of  the  early <br/>pagan  world. <br/><br/>Concerning  this  subject,  H.  P.  Blavatsky,  the  foremost  occultist  of  the  nineteenth  century,  has  written: <br/>'Plants  also  have  like  mystical  properties  in  a  most  wonderful  degree,  and  the  secrets  of  the  herbs  of <br/>dreams  and  enchantments  are  only  lost  to  European  science,  and  useless  to  say,  too,  are  unknown  to <br/>it,  except  in  a  few  marked  instances,  such  as  opium  and  hashish.  Yet,  the  psychical  effects  of  even <br/>these  few  upon  the  human  system  are  regarded  as  evidences  of  a  temporary  mental  disorder.  The <br/>women  of  Thessaly  and  Epirus,  the  female  hierophants  of  the  rites  of  Sabazius,  did  not  carry  their <br/>secrets  away  with  the  downfall  of  their  sanctuaries.  They  are  still  preserved,  and  those  who  are  aware <br/>of  the  nature  of  Soma,  know  the  properties  of  other  plants  as  well.&quot;  (/sis  Unveiled.) <br/><br/>Herbal  compounds  were  used  to  cause  temporary  clairvoyance  in  connection  with  the  oracles, <br/>especially  the  one  at  Delphi.  Words  spoken  while  in  these  imposed  trances  were  regarded  as <br/>prophetic.  Modem  mediums,  while  under  control  as  the  result  of  partly  self-imposed  catalepsy,  give <br/>messages  somewhat  similar  to  those  of  the  ancient  prophets,  but  in  the  majority  of  cases  their  results <br/>are  far  less  accurate,  for  the  soothsayers  of  today  lack  the  knowledge  of  Nature's  hidden  forces. <br/><br/>The  Mysteries  taught  that  during  the  higher  degrees  of  initiation  the  gods  themselves  took  part  in  the <br/>instruction  of  candidates  or  at  least  were  present,  which  was  in  itself  a  benediction.  As  the  deities <br/>dwelt  in  the  invisible  worlds  and  came  only  in  their  spiritual  bodies,  it  was  impossible  for  the <br/>neophj^e  to  cognize  them  without  the  assistance  of  drugs  which  stimulated  the  clairvoyant  center  of <br/>his  consciousness  (probably  the  pineal  gland).  Many  initiates  in  the  ancient  Mysteries  stated <br/>emphatically  that  they  had  conversed  with  the  immortals,  and  had  beheld  the  gods. <br/><br/>When  the  standards  of  the  pagans  became  corrupted,  a  division  took  place  in  the  Mysteries.  The  band <br/><br/>of  truly  enlightened  ones  separated  themselves  from  the  rest  and,  preserving  the  most  important  of <br/>their  secrets,  vanished  without  leaving  a  trace.  The  rest  slowly  drifted,  like  rudderless  ships,  on  the <br/><br/><br/>rocks  of  degeneracy  and  disintegration.  Some  of  the  less  important  of  the  secret  formulae  fell  into  the <br/>hands  of  the  profane,  who  perverted  them~as  in  the  case  of  the  Bacchanalia,  during  which  drugs  were <br/>mixed  with  wine  and  became  the  real  cause  of  the  orgies. <br/><br/>In  certain  parts  of  the  earth  it  was  maintained  that  there  were  natural  wells,  springs,  or  fountains,  in <br/><br/>which  the  water  (because  of  the  minerals  through  which  it  coursed)  was  tinctured  with  sacred <br/>properties.  Temples  were  often  built  near  these  spots,  and  in  some  cases  natural  caves  which  chanced <br/>to  be  in  the  vicinity  were  sanctified  to  some  deity. <br/><br/>&quot;The  aspirants  to  initiation,  and  those  who  came  to  request  prophetic  dreams  of  the  Gods,  were <br/>prepared  by  a  fast,  more  or  less  prolonged,  after  which  they  partook  of  meals  expressly  prepared;  and <br/>also  of  mysterious  drinks,  such  as  the  water  of  Lethe,  and  the  water  of  Mnemosyne  in  the  grotto  of <br/>Trophonius;  or  of  the  Ciceion  in  the  mysteries  of  the  Eleusinia.  Different  drugs  were  easily  mixed  up <br/>with  the  meats  or  introduced  into  the  drinks,  according  to  the  state  of  mind  or  body  into  which  it  was <br/>necessary  to  throw  the  recipient,  and  the  nature  of  the  visions  he  was  desirous  of  procuring.&quot; <br/>(Salverte's  The  Occult  Sciences.)  The  same  author  states  that  certain  sects  of  early  Christianity  were <br/>accused  of  using  drugs  for  the  same  general  purposes  as  the  pagans. <br/><br/>The  sect  of  the  Assassins,  or  the  Yezidees  as  they  are  more  generally  known,  demonstrated  a  rather <br/>interesting  aspect  of  the  drug  problem.  In  the  eleventh  century  this  order,  by  capturing  the  fortress  of <br/>Mount  Alamont,  established  itself  at  Irak.  Hassan  Sabbah,  the  founder  of  the  order,  known  as  the <br/>&quot;Old  Man  of  the  Mountain, &quot;  is  suspected  of  having  controlled  his  followers  by  the  use  of  narcotics. <br/>Hassan  made  his  followers  believe  that  they  were  in  Paradise,  where  they  would  be  forever  if  they <br/>implicitly  obeyed  him  while  they  were  alive.  De  Quincey,  in  his  Confessions  of  an  Opium  Eater, <br/>describes  the  peculiar  psychological  effects  produced  by  this  product  of  the  poppy,  and  the  use  of  a <br/>similar  drug  may  have  given  rise  to  the  idea  of  Paradise  which  filled  the  minds  of  the  Yezidees. <br/><br/>The  philosophers  of  all  ages  have  taught  that  the  visible  universe  was  but  a  fractional  part  of  the <br/>whole,  and  that  by  analogy  the  physical  body  of  man  is  in  reality  the  least  important  part  of  his <br/>composite  constitution.  Most  of  the  medical  systems  of  today  almost  entirely  ignore  the  superphysical <br/>man.  They  pay  but  scant  attention  to  causes,  and  concentrate  their  efforts  on  ameliorating  effects. <br/>Paracelsus,  noting  the  same  proclivity  on  the  part  of  physicians  during  his  day,  aptly  remarked: <br/>&quot;There  is  a  great  difference  between  the  power  that  removes  the  invisible  causes  of  disease,  and  which <br/>is  Magic,  and  that  which  causes  merely  external  effects  [to]  disappear,  and  which  is  Physic,  Sorcery, <br/>and  Quackery.&quot;  (Translated  by  Franz  Hartmann.) <br/><br/>Disease  is  unnatural,  and  is  evidence  that  there  is  a  maladjustment  within  or  between  organs  or <br/>tissues.  Permanent  health  cannot  be  regained  until  harmony  is  restored.  The  outstanding  virtue  of <br/>Hermetic  medicine  was  its  recognition  of  spiritual  and  psychophysical  derangements  as  being  largely <br/>responsible  for  the  condition  which  is  called  physical  disease.  Suggestive  therapy  was  used  with <br/>marked  success  by  the  priest-physicians  of  the  ancient  world.  Among  the-American  Indians,  the <br/>Shamans&#x2014; or  &quot;Medicine  Men&quot;~dispelled  sickness  v^th  the  aid  of  mysterious  dances,  invocations,  and <br/>charms.  The  fact  that  in  spite  of  their  ignorance  of  modern  methods  of  medical  treatment  these <br/>sorcerers  effected  innumerable  cures,  is  well  worthy  of  consideration. <br/><br/>The  magic  rituals  used  by  the  Egyptian  priests  for  the  curing  of  disease  were  based  upon  a  highly <br/>developed  comprehension  of  the  complex  workings  of  the  human  mind  and  its  reactions  upon  the <br/>physical  constitution.  The  Egyptian  and  Brahmin  worlds  undoubtedly  understood  the  fundamental <br/>principle  of  vibrotherapeutics.  By  means  of  chants  and  mantras,  which  emphasized  certain  vowel  and <br/>consonant  sounds,  they  set  up  vibratory  reactions  which  dispelled  congestions  and  assisted  Nature  in <br/>reconstructing  broken  members  and  depleted  organisms.  They  also  applied  their  knowledge  of  the <br/>laws  governing  vibration  to  the  spiritual  constitution  of  man;  by  their  intonings,  they  stimulated <br/>latent  centers  of  consciousness  and  thereby  vastly  increased  the  sensitiveness  of  the  subjective  nature. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  Book  of  Coming  Forth  by  Day,  many  of  the  Egyptian  secrets  have  been  preserved  to  this <br/>generation.  While  this  ancient  scroll  has  been  well  translated,  only  a  few  understand  the  secret: <br/>significance  of  its  magical  passages.  Oriental  races  have  a  keen  realization  of  the  dynamics  of  sound. <br/>They  know  that  every  spoken  word  has  tremendous  power  and  that  by  certain  arrangements  of  words <br/>they  can  create  vortices  of  force  in  the  invisible  universe  about  them  and  thereby  profoundly <br/>influence  physical  substance.  The  Sacred  Word  by  which  the  world  was  established,  the  Lost  Word <br/>which  Masonry  is  still  seeking,  and  the  threefold  Divine  Name  symbolized  by  A.  U.  M.~the  creative <br/>tone  of  the  Hindus&#x2014;all  are  indicative  of  the  veneration  accorded  the  principle  of  sound. <br/><br/>The  so-called  &quot;new  discoveries&quot;  of  modern  science  are  often  only  rediscoveries  of  secrets  well  known <br/>to  the  priests  and  philosophers  of  ancient  pagandom.  Man's  inhumanity  to  man  has  resulted  in  the <br/>loss  of  records  and  formula:  which,  had  they  been  preserved,  would  have  solved  many  of  the  greatest <br/>problems  of  this  civilization.  With  sword  and  firebrand,  races  obliterate  the  records  of  their <br/>predecessors,  and  then  inevitably  meet  with  an  untimely  fate  for  need  of  the  very  wisdom  they  have <br/>destroyed. <br/><br/><br/>De  Monte-Snyders  declares  that  each  of  the  above  characters  forms  one  syllables  of  a  word  having  seven  syllables,  the <br/>wrord  itself  representing  the  materia  prima,  or  first  substance  of  the  universe.  As  all  substance  is  composed  of  seven <br/>powers  combined  according  to  certain  cosmic  laws,  a  great  mystery  is  concealed  within  the  sevenfold  constitution  of  man, <br/>and  the  universe.  Of  the  above  seven  characters,  De  Monte-Snyder  writes: <br/><br/>Whoever  wants  to  know  the  true  name  and  character  of  the  materia  prima  shall  know  that  out  of  the  combination  of  the <br/>above  figures  syllables  are  produced,  and  out  of  these  the  verbum  significativum.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>CHEMICAL  SYLLABLES. <br/><br/><br/>From  De  Monte-Snyders'  Metamorphosis  Planetarum. <br/><br/><br/>p- 113 <br/><br/><br/>The  Qabbalah,  the  Secret  Doctrine  of  Israel <br/><br/>ALBERT  PIKE,  quoting  from  Transcendental  Magic,  thus  sums  up  the  importance  of  Qabbahsm  as  a <br/>key  to  Masonic  esotericism:  &quot;One  is  filled  with  admiration,  on  penetrating  into  the  Sanctuary  of  the <br/>Kabalah,  at  seeing  a  doctrine  so  logical,  so  simple,  and  at  the  same  time  so  absolute.  The  necessary <br/>union  of  ideas  and  signs,  the  consecration  of  the  most  fundamental  realities  by  the  primitive <br/>characters;  the  Trinity  of  Words,  Letters,  and  Numbers;  a  philosophy  simple  as  the  alphabet, <br/>profound  and  infinite  as  the  Word;  theorems  more  complete  and  luminous  than  those  of  Pythagoras; <br/>a  theology  summed  up  by  counting  on  one's  fingers;  an  Infinite  which  can  be  held  in  the  hollow  of  an <br/>infant's  hand;  ten  ciphers  and  twenty-two  letters,  a  triangle,  a  square,  and  a  circle,~these  are  all  the <br/>elements  of  the  Kabalah.  These  are  the  elementary  principles  of  the  written  Word,  reflection  of  that <br/>spoken  Word  that  created  the  world!&quot;  (Morals  and  Dogma.) <br/><br/>Hebrew  theology  was  divided  into  three  distinct  parts.  The  first  was  the  law,  the  second  was  the  soul <br/>of  the  law,  and  the  third  was  the  soul  of  the  soul  of  the  law.  The  law  was  taught  to  all  the  children  of <br/>Israel;  the  Mishna,  or  the  soul  of  the  law,  was  revealed  to  the  Rabbins  and  teachers;  but  the  Qabbalah, <br/>the  soul  of  the  soul  of  the  law,  was  cunningly  concealed,  and  only  the  highest  initiates  among  the  Jews <br/>were  instructed  in  its  secret  principles. <br/><br/>According  to  certain  Jewish  mystics,  Moses  ascended  Mount  Sinai  three  times,  remaining  in  the <br/>presence  of  God  forty  days  each  time.  During  the  first  forty  days  the  tables  of  the  written  law  were <br/>delivered  to  the  prophet;  during  the  second  forty  days  he  received  the  soul  of  the  law;  and  during  the <br/>last  forty  days  God  instructed  him  in  the  mysteries  of  the  Qabbalah,  the  soul  of  the  soul  of  the  law. <br/>Moses  concealed  in  the  first  four  books  of  the  Pentateuch  the  secret  instructions  that  God  had  given <br/>him,  and  for  centuries  students  of  Qabbalism.  have  sought  therein  the  secret  doctrine  of  Israel.  As  the <br/>spiritual  nature  of  man  is  concealed  in  his  physical  body,  so  the  unwritten  law&#x2014;the  Mishna  and  the <br/>Qabbalah&#x2014; is  concealed  within  the  written  teachings  of  the  Mosaic  code.  Qabbalah  means  the  secret <br/>or  hidden  tradition,  the  unwritten  law,  and  according  to  an  early  Rabbi,  it  was  delivered  to  man  in <br/>order  that  through  the  aid  of  its  abstruse  principles  he  might  learn  to  understand  the  mystery  of  both <br/>the  universe  about  him  and  the  universe  within  him. <br/><br/>The  origin  of  Qabbalism  is  a  legitimate  subject  for  controversy.  Early  initiates  of  the  Qabbalistic <br/>Mysteries  believed  that  its  principles  were  first  taught  by  God  to  a  school  of  His  angels  before  the  fall <br/>of  man.  The  angels  later  communicated  the  secrets  to  Adam,  so  that  through  the  knowledge  gained <br/>from  an  understanding  of  its  principles  fallen  humanity  might  regain  its  lost  a  estate.  The  Angel <br/>Raziel  was  dispatched  from  heaven  to  instruct  Adam  in  the  mysteries  of  the  Qabbalah.  Different <br/>angels  were  employed  to  initiate  the  succeeding  patriarchs  in  this  difficult  science.  Tophiel  was  the <br/>teacher  of  Shem,  Raphael  of  Isaac,  Metatron  of  Moses,  and  Michael  of  David.  (See  Faiths  of  the <br/>World.) <br/><br/>Christian  D.  Ginsburg  has  written:  &quot;From  Adam  it  passed  over  to  Noah,  and  then  to  Abraham,  the <br/>friend  of  God,  who  emigrated  with  it  to  Egypt,  where  the  patriarch  allowed  a  portion  of  this <br/>mysterious  doctrine  to  ooze  out.  It  was  in  this  way  that  the  Egyptians  obtained  some  knowledge  of  it, <br/>and  the  other  Eastern  nations  could  introduce  it  into  their  philosophical  systems.  Moses,  who  was <br/>learned  in  all  the  wisdom  of  Egypt,  was  first  initiated  into  it  in  the  land  of  his  birth,  but  became  most <br/>proficient  in  it  during  his  wanderings  in  the  wilderness,  when  he  not  only  devoted  to  it  the  leisure <br/>hours  of  the  whole  forty  years,  but  received  lessons  in  it  from  one  of  the  angels.  *  *  *  Moses  also <br/>initiated  the  seventy  Elders  into  the  secrets  of  this  doctrine  and  they  again  transmitted  them  from <br/>hand  to  hand.  Of  all  who  formed  the  unbroken  line  of  tradition,  David  and  Solomon  were  most <br/>initiated  into  the  Kabbalah.&quot;  (See  The  Kabbalah.) <br/><br/><br/>According  to  Eliphas  Levi,  the  three  greatest  books  of  QabbaHsm  are  the  Sepher  Yetzirah,  The  Book <br/>of  Formation;  the  Sepher  ha  Zohar,  The  Book  of  Splendor;  and  the  Apocalypse,  The  Book  of <br/>Revelation.  The  dates  of  the  writing  of  these  books  are  by  no  means  thoroughly  established. <br/>Qabbalists  declare  that  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  was  written  by  Abraham.  Although  it  is  by  far  the  oldest <br/>of  the  Qabbalistic  books,  it  was  probably  from  the  pen  of  the  Rabbi  Akiba,  A.D.  120. <br/><br/>The  Sepher  ha  Zohar  presumably  was  written  by  Simeon  ben  Jochai,  a  disciple  of  Akiba.  Rabbi <br/>Simeon  was  sentenced  to  death  about  A.D.  161  by  Lucius  Verus,  co-regent  of  the  Emperor  Marc <br/>Aurelius  Antoninus.  He  escaped  with  his  son  and,  hiding  in  a  cave,  transcribed  the  manuscript  of  the <br/>Zohar  with  the  assistance  of  Elias,  who  appeared  to  them  at  intervals.  Simeon  was  twelve  years  in  the <br/>cave,  during  which  time  he  evolved  the  complicated  symbolism  of  the  &quot;Greater  Face&quot;  and  the  &quot;Lesser <br/>Face.&quot;  While  discoursing  with  disciples  Rabbi  Simeon  expired,  and  the  &quot;Lamp  of  Israel&quot;  was <br/>extinguished.  His  death  and  burial  were  accompanied  by  many  supernatural  phenomena.  The  legend <br/>goes  on  to  relate  that  the  secret  doctrines  of  Qabbalism  had  been  in  existence  since  the  beginning  of <br/>the  world,  but  that  Rabbi  Simeon  was  the  first  man  permitted  to  reduce  them  to  writing.  Twelve <br/>hundred  years  later  the  books  which  he  had  compiled  were  discovered  and  published  for  the  benefit <br/>of  humanity  by  Moses  de  Leon.  The  probability  is  that  Moses  de  Leon  himself  compiled  the  Zohar <br/>about  A.D.  1305,  drawing  his  material  from  the  unwritten  secrets  of  earlier  Jewish  mystics.  The <br/>Apocalypse,  accredited  to  St.  John  the  Divine,  is  also  of  uncertain  date,  and  the  identity  of  its  author <br/>has  never  been  satisfactorily  proved. <br/><br/>Because  of  its  brevity  and  because  it  is  the  key  to  Qabbalistic  thought,  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  is <br/>reproduced  in  full  in  this  chapter.  So  far  as  is <br/><br/><br/>THE  SEVENTY-TWO  NAMES  OF  GOD. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  (EdipusMgyptiacus. <br/><br/><br/>This  rare  cut  shows  the  name  of  God  in  seventy-two  languages  inscribed  upon  the  petals  of  a  symbolic  sunflower.  Above <br/>the  circle  are  the  seventy-two  powers  of  God  according  to  the  Hebrew  Qabbalah.  Below  two  trees,  that  on  the  left  bearing <br/>the  symbols  of  the  planets  and  that  on  the  right  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  and  the  names  of  the  tribes  of  Israel.  The  esoteric <br/>doctrines  of  the  Qabbalah  are  in  alignment  with  the  secret  teachings  of  all  the  schools  of  philosophy,  but  the  method  by <br/>which  its  secrets  are  revealed  to  the  wise  and  concealed  from  the  ignorant  is  most  unusual.  As  the  religious  world <br/>interprets  its  scriptures  with  twentieth-century  educational  facilities,  it  becomes  ever  more  apparent  that  the  sacred  books <br/>were  not  historical  documents,  but  that  the  kings,  sages,  prophets,  and  saviors  whom  Bible  students  ham  revered  for  ages <br/>as  once-existing  personalities  are  in  reality  only  personified  attributes  of  man  himself. <br/><br/>p.  114 <br/><br/>known,  the  Sepher  ha  Zohar  has  never  been  completely  translated  into  English,  but  it  can  be <br/>obtained  in  French.  (S.  L.  MacGregor-Mathers  translated  three  books  of  the  Zohar  into  English.)  The <br/>Zohar  contains  a  vast  number  of  philosophical  tenets,  and  a  paraphrase  of  its  salient  points  is <br/>embodied  in  this  work. <br/><br/>Few  realize  the  influence  exerted  by  Qabbalism  over  medieval  thought,  both  Christian  and  Jewish.  It <br/>taught  that  there  existed  within  the  sacred  writings  a  hidden  doctrine  which  was  the  key  to  those <br/>writings.  This  is  symbolized  by  the  crossed  keys  upon  the  papal  crest.  Scores  of  learned  minds  began <br/>to  search  for  those  arcane  truths  by  which  the  race  should  be  redeemed;  and  that  their  labor  was  not <br/>without  its  reward,  their  subsequent  writings  have  demonstrated. <br/><br/>The  theories  of  Qabbalism  are  inextricably  interwoven  with  the  tenets  of  alchemy,  Hermeticism, <br/>Rosicrucianism,  and  Freemasonry.  The  words  Qabbalism  and  Hermeticism  are  now  considered  as <br/>synonymous  terms  covering  all  the  arcana  and  esotericism  of  antiquity.  The  simple  Qabbalism  of  the <br/>first  centuries  of  the  Christian  Era  gradually  evolved  into  an  elaborate  theological  system,  which <br/>became  so  involved  that  it  was  next  to  impossible  to  comprehend  its  dogma. <br/><br/>The  Qabbalists  divided  the  uses  of  their  sacred  science  into  five  sections.  The  Natural  Qabbalah  was <br/><br/>used  solely  to  assist  the  investigator  in  his  study  of  Nature's  mysteries.  The  Analogical  Qabbalah  was <br/>formulated  to  exhibit  the  relationship  which  exists  between  all  things  in  Nature,  and  it  revealed  to  the <br/>wise  that  all  creatures  and  substances  were  one  in  essence,  and  that  man&#x2014;the  Little  Universe&#x2014;was  a <br/>replica  in  miniature  of  God&#x2014;the  Great  Universe.  The  Contemplative  Qabbalah  was  evolved  for  the <br/>purpose  of  revealing  through  the  higher  intellectual  faculties  the  mysteries  of  the  celestial  spheres.  By <br/>its  aid  the  abstract  reasoning  faculties  cognized  the  measureless  planes  of  infinity  and  learned  to <br/>know  the  creatures  existing  within  them.  The  Astrological  Qabbalah  instructed  those  who  studied  its <br/>lore  in  the  power,  magnitude,  and  actual  substance  of  the  sidereal  bodies,  and  also  revealed  the <br/>mystical  constitution  of  the  planet  itself.  The  fifth,  or  Magical  Qabbalah,  was  studied  by  such  as <br/>desired  to  gain  control  over  the  demons  and  subhuman  intelligences  of  the  invisible  worlds.  It  was <br/>also  highly  valued  as  a  method  of  healing  the  sick  by  talismans,  amulets,  charms,  and  invocations. <br/><br/>The  Sepher  Yetzirah,  according  to  Adolph  Franck,  differs  from  other  sacred  books  in  that  it  does  not <br/>explain  the  world  and  the  phenomena  of  which  it  is  the  stage  by  leaning  on  the  idea  of  God  or  by <br/>setting  itself  up  as  the  interpreter  of  the  supreme  will.  This  ancient  work  rather  reveals  God  by <br/>estimating  His  manifold  handiwork.  In  preparing  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  for  the  consideration  of  the <br/>reader,  five  separate  English  translations  have  been  compared.  The  resulting  form,  while  it  embodies <br/>the  salient  features  of  each,  is  not  a  direct  translation  from  any  one  Hebrew  or  Latin  text.  Although <br/>the  purpose  was  to  convey  the  spirit  rather  than  the  letter  of  the  ancient  document,  there  are  no  wide <br/>deviations  from  the  original  rendition.  So  far  as  known,  the  first  translation  of  the  Sepher  Yetzirah <br/>into  English  was  made  by  the  Rev.  Dr.  Isidor  Kalisch,  in  1877.  (See  Arthur  Edward  Waite.)  In  this <br/>translation  the  Hebrew  text  accompanies  the  English  words.  The  work  of  Dr.  Kalisch  has  been  used  as <br/>the  foundation  of  the  following  interpretation,  but  material  from  other  authorities  has  been <br/>incorporated  and  many  passages  have  been  rewritten  to  simplify  the  general  theme. <br/><br/><br/>At  hand  also  was  a  manuscript  copy  in  English  of  the  Book  of  the  CabalistickArt,  by  Doctor  John <br/>Pistor.  The  document  is  undated;  but  judging  from  the  general  type  of  the  writing,  the  copy  was  made <br/>during  the  eighteenth  century.  The  third  volume  used  as  a  reference  was  the  Sepher  Yetzirah,  by  the <br/>late  Win.  Wynn  Westcott,  Magus  of  the  Rosicrucian  Society  of  England.  The  fourth  was  the  Sepher <br/>Yetzirah,  or  The  Book  of  Creation,  according  to  the  translation  in  the  Sacred  Books  and  Early <br/>Literature  of  the  East,  edited  by  Prof.  Charles  F.  Horne.  The  fifth  was  a  recent  publication,  The  Book <br/>of  Formation,  by  Knut  Stenring,  containing  an  introduction  by  Arthur  Edward  Waite.  At  hand  also <br/>were  four  other  copies&#x2014;two  German,  one  Hebrew,  and  one  Latin.  Certain  portions  of  the  Sepher <br/>Yetzirah  are  considered  older  and  more  authentic  than  the  rest,  bur  the  controversy  regarding  them <br/>is  involved  and  nonproductive  that  it  is  useless  to  add  further  comment.  The  doubtful  passages  are <br/>therefore  included  in  the  document  at  the  points  where  they  would  naturally  fall. <br/><br/>THE  SEPHER  YETZIRAH,  THE  BOOK  OF  FORMATION <br/><br/>Chapter  One <br/><br/>1.  YAH,  the  Lord  of  Hosts,  the  living  Elohim,  King  of  the  Universe,  Omnipotent,  the  Merciful  and <br/>Gracious  God,  Supreme  and  Extolled,  Dweller  in  the  Height  whose  habitation  is  Eternity,  who  is <br/>Sublime  and  Most-Holy,  engraved  His  name  and  ordained  (formed)  and  created  the  Universe  in <br/>thirty-two  mysterious  paths  (stages)  of  wisdom  (science),  by  three  Sepharim,  namely.  Numbers, <br/>Letters,  and  Sounds,  which  are  in  Him  one  and  the  same. <br/><br/>2.  Ten  Sephiroth  (ten  properties  from  the  Ineffable  One)  and  twenty-two  letters  are  the  Foundation  of <br/>all  things.  Of  these  twenty-two  letters  three  are  called  &quot;Mothers,&quot;  sewn  &quot;Double,&quot;  and  twelve <br/>&quot;Simple.&quot; <br/><br/>3.  The  ten  numbers  (Sephiroth)  out  of  Nothing  are  analogous  to  the  ten  fingers  and  the  ten  toes:  five <br/>over  against  five.  In  the  center  between  them  is  the  covenant  with  the  Only  One  God.  In  the  spiritual <br/>world  it  is  the  covenant  of  the  voice  (the  Word),  and  in  the  corporeal  world  the  circumcision  of  the <br/>flesh  (the  rite  of  Abraham). <br/><br/>4.  Ten  are  the  numbers  (of  the  Sephiroth)  out  of  Nothing,  ten&#x2014;not  nine;  ten&#x2014; not  eleven. <br/>Comprehend  this  great,  wisdom,  understand  this  knowledge  and  be  wise.  Inquire  into  the  mystery <br/>and  ponder  it.  Examine  all  things  by  means  of  the  ten  Sephiroth.  Restore  the  Word  to  Its  Creator  and <br/>lead  the  Creator  back  to  His  throne  again.  He  is  the  only  Formator  and  beside  Him  there  is  no  other. <br/>His  attributes  are  ten  and  are  without  limit. <br/><br/>5.  The  ten  ineffable  Sephiroth  have  ten  infinitudes,  which  are  as  follows: <br/>The  infinite  beginning  and  the  infinite  end; <br/><br/>The  infinite  good  and  the  infinite  evil; <br/>The  infinite  height  and  the  infinite  depth; <br/>The  infinite  East  and  the  infinite  West; <br/>The  infinite  North  and  the  infinite  South; <br/><br/>and  over  them  is  the  Lord  Superlatively  One,  the  faithful  King.  He  rules  over  all  in  all  from  His  holy <br/>habitation  for  ages  of  ages. <br/><br/><br/>6.  The  appearance  of  the  ten  spheres  (Sephiroth)  out  of  Nothing  is  as  a  flash  of  Ughtning  or  a <br/><br/>sparkling  flame,  and  they  are  without  beginning  or  end.  The  Word  of  God  is  in  them  when  they  go <br/>forth  and  when  they  return.  They  run  by  His  order  like  a  whirlwind  and  prostrate  themselves  before <br/>His  throne. <br/><br/>7.  The  ten  Sephiroth  have  their  end  linked  to  their  beginning  and  their  beginning  linked  to  their  end, <br/>cojoined  as  the  flame  is  wedded  to  the  live  coal,  for  the  Lord  is  Superlatively  One  and  to  Him  there  is <br/>no  second.  Before  One  what  can  you  count? <br/><br/>8.  Concerning  the  number  (10)  of  the  spheres  of  existence  (Sephiroth)  out  of  Nothing,  seal  up  your <br/>lips  and  guard  your  heart  as  you  consider  them,  and  if  your  month  opens  for  utterance  and  your  heart <br/>turns  towards  thought,  control  them,  returning  to  silence.  So  it  is  written:  &quot;And  the  living  creatures <br/>ran  and  returned.&quot;  (Ezekiel  i.  14.)  And  on  this  wise  was  the  covenant  made  with  us, <br/><br/>9.  These  are  the  ten  emanations  of  number  out  of  Nothing: <br/><br/>1st.  The  spirit  of  the  living  Elohim,  blessed  and  more  than  blessed  be  the  living  Elohim  of  ages.  His <br/>Voice,  His  Spirit,  and  His  Word  are  the  Holy  Spirit. <br/><br/>2nd.  He  produced  air  from  the  spirit  and  in  the  air.  He  formed  and  established  twenty-two  sounds&#x2014; <br/>the  letters.  Three  of  them  were  fundamental,  or  mothers;  seven  were  double;  and  twelve  were  simple <br/>(single);  but  the  spirit  is  the  first  one  and  above  all. <br/><br/>3rd.  Primordial  water  He  extracted  from  the  air.  He  formed  therein  twenty-two  letters  and <br/>established  them  out  of  mud  and  loam,  making  them  like  a  border,  putting  them  up  like  a  wall,  and <br/>surrounding  them  as  with  a  rampart.  He  poured  snow  upon  them  and  it  became  earth,  as  it  reads: <br/>&quot;He  said  to  the  snow  be  thou  earth.&quot;  (Job.  xxxvii.  6.) <br/><br/>4th.  Fire  (ether)  He  drew  forth  from  the  water.  He  engraved  and  established  by  it  the  Throne  of  Glory. <br/>He  fashioned  the  Seraphim,  the  Ophanim,  and  the  Holy  Living  Creatures  (Cherubim?),  as  His <br/>ministering  angels;  and  with  (of)  these  three  He  formed  His  habitation,  as  it  reads:  &quot;Who  made  His <br/>angels  spirits.  His  ministers  a  flaming  fire.&quot;  (Psalms  civ.  4.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  TETRAGRAMMATON. <br/><br/><br/>By  arranging  the  four  letters  of  the  Great  Name,  m  n  %  (IHVH),  in  the  form  of  the  Pythagorean  Tetractys,  the  72  powers <br/>of  the  Great  Name  of  God  are  manifested.  The  key  to  the  problem  is  as  follows: <br/><br/><br/>= <br/><br/>I <br/><br/>= <br/><br/>10 <br/><br/>= <br/><br/>10 <br/><br/>HI <br/><br/>5+10 <br/><br/>&#x2014; <br/><br/>15 <br/><br/>= <br/><br/>VHI <br/><br/>= <br/><br/>6+5+10 <br/><br/>21 <br/><br/>T <br/><br/>rl  V  rl  i <br/><br/>5+O+5+10 <br/><br/>20 <br/><br/>The  Great <br/>Name  of <br/>God <br/><br/>72 <br/><br/>P- 115 <br/><br/>Sth.  He  selected  three  consonants  (I,  H,  V)  from  the  simple  ones&#x2014;a  secret  belonging  to  the  three <br/>mothers,  or  first  elements;  li'  a  x  (A,  M,  Sh),  air,  water,  fire  (ether).  He  sealed  them  with  His  spirit  and <br/>fashioned  them  into  a  Great  Name  and  with  this  sealed  the  universe  in  six  directions.  He  turned <br/>towards  the  above  and  sealed  the  height  with  i  n  '  (I,  H,  V). <br/><br/>6th..  He  turned  towards  the  below  and  sealed  the  depth  withi '  n  (H,  I,  V). <br/><br/>yth.  He  turned  forward  and  sealed  the  East  with      (V,  I,  H). <br/><br/>8th..  He  turned  backward  and  sealed  the  West  with  '  m  (V  H,  I). <br/><br/>gth.  He  turned  to  the  right  and  sealed  the  South  with  m  '  (I,  V,  H). <br/><br/>loth.  He  turned  to  the  left  and  sealed  the  North  with  n  n  (H,  V,  I). <br/><br/>NOTE.  This  arrangement  of  the  letters  of  the  Great  Name  is  according  to  the  Rev.  Dr.  Isidor  Kalisch. <br/><br/>10.  These  are  the  ten  ineffable  existences  out  of  nothing;  From  the  spirit  of  the  Living  God  emanated <br/>air;  from  the  air,  water;  from  the  water,  fire  (ether);  from  the  fire,  the  height  and  the  depth,  the  East <br/>and  the  West,  the  North  and  the  South. <br/><br/>Chapter  Two <br/><br/>1.  There  are  twenty-two  basic  (sounds  and)  letters.  Three  are  the  first  elements  (water,  air,  fire), <br/>fundamentals,  or  mothers;  seven  are  double  letters;  and  twelve  are  simple  letters.  The  three <br/>fundamental  letters  ^1:1  a  have  as  their  basis  the  balance.  At  one  end  of  the  scale  are  the  virtues  and  at <br/>the  other  the  vices,  placed  in  equilibrium  by  the  tongue.  Of  the  fundamental  letters  a  (M)  is  mute  like <br/>the  water,  li?  (Sh)  hissing  like  fire,  x  (A)  a  reconciling  breath  between  them,  t <br/><br/>2.  The  twenty-two  basic  letters  having  been  designed,  appointed,  and  established  by  God,  He <br/>combined,  weighed,  and  exchanged  them  (each  with  the  others),  and  formed  by  them  all  beings  which <br/>are  in  existence,  and  all  which  will  be  formed  in  time  to  come. <br/><br/>3.  He  established  twenty-two  basic  letters,  formed  by  the  voice  and  impressed  upon  the  air  by  the <br/>breath.  He  set  them  to  be  audibly  uttered  in  five  different  parts  of  the  human  mouth:  namely. <br/>Gutturals,  j;  n  n  n;  Palatals,  pan;  Linguals,  n  ] u  t  Dentals,  f  -i  d  li' t;  Labials,  n  a  i  3. <br/><br/>4.  He  fixed  the  twenty-two  basic  letters  in  a  ring  (sphere)  like  a  wall  with  two  hundred  and  thirty-one <br/>gates,  and  turned  the  sphere  forward  and  backward.  Turned  forward,  the  sphere  signified  good;  when <br/><br/><br/>reversed,  evil.  Three  letters  may  serve  for  an  illustration:  There  is  nothing  better  than  :;i  3  i?  (O,  N,  G), <br/>pleasure  Qoy),  and  nothing  worse  than  y  in  3  (N,  G,  O),  plague  (sorrow). <br/><br/>5.  How  was  it  all  accomplished?  He  combined,  weighed,  and  changed:  the  K  (A)  with  all  the  other <br/>letters  in  succession,  and  all  the  others  again  with  x  (A),  and  all  again  with  2  (B);  and  so  with  the <br/>whole  series  of  letters.  Hence  it  follows  that  there  are  two  hundred  and  thirty-one  formations,  or <br/>gates,  through  which  the  powers  of  the  letters  go  forth;  every  creature  and  every  language  proceeded <br/>from  One  Name  and  the  combinations  of  its  letters. <br/><br/>6.  He  created  a  reality  out  of  Nothing.  He  called  the  nonentity  into  existence  and  hewed  colossal <br/>pillars  from  intangible  air.  This  has  been  shown  by  the  example  of  combining  the  letter  x  (A)  with  all <br/>the  other  letters,  and  all  the  other  letters  with  x.  By  speaking  He  created  every  creature  and  every <br/>word  by  the  power  of  One  Name.  As  an  illustration,  consider  the  twenty-two  elementary  substances <br/>from  the  primitive  substance  of  X.  The  production  of  every  creature  from  the  twenty-two  letters  is <br/>proof  that  they  are  in  reality  the  twenty-two  parts  of  one  living  body. <br/><br/>Chapter  Three <br/><br/>1.  The  first  three  elements  (the  Mother  letters,  li'  a  x)  resemble  a  balance,  in  one  scale  virtue  and  in  the <br/>other  vice,  placed  in  equilibrium  by  the  tongue. <br/><br/>2.  The  three  Mothers,  tz;  a  x,  enclose  a  great,  wonderful,  and  unknown  mystery,  and  are  sealed  by  six <br/>wings  (or  elementary  circles),  namely,  air,  water,  fire&#x2014;each  divided  into  an  active  and  a  passive  power. <br/>The  Mothers,  tz;  a  x,  gave  birth  to  the  Fathers  (the  progenitors),  and  these  gave  birth  to  the <br/>generations. <br/><br/>3.  God  appointed  and  established  three  Mothers,  ^riK,  combined,  weighed,  and  exchanged  them, <br/>forming  by  them  three  Mothers,  in  the  universe,  in  the  year,  and  in  man  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>4.  The  three  Mothers,    a  x,  in  the  universe  are:  air,  water,  and  fire.  Heaven  was  created  from  the <br/>elementary  fire  (or  ether)    the  earth,  comprising  sea  and  land,  from  the  elementary  water,  a,  and  the <br/>atmospheric  air  from  the  elementary  air,  or  spirit,  X,  which  establishes  the  balance  among  them.  Thus <br/>were  all  things  produced. <br/><br/>5.  The  three  Mothers,  produce  in  the  year  heat,  coldness,  and  the  temperate  state.  Heat  was <br/>created  from  fire,  coldness  from  water,  and  the  temperate  state  from  air,  which  equilibrates  them. <br/><br/>6.  The  three  Mothers,         produce  in  man  (male  and  female)  breast,  abdomen,  and  head.  The  head <br/>was  formed  from  the  fire,  ^;  the  abdomen  from  the  water,  a;  and  the  breast  (thorax)  from  air,  x,  which <br/>places  them  in  equilibrium. <br/><br/>7.  God  let  the  letter  x  (A)  predominate  in  primordial  air,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  other  two, <br/>and  sealed  the  air  in  the  universe,  the  temperate  state  in  the  year,  and  the  breast  in  man  (male  and <br/>female). <br/><br/>8.  He  let  the  letter  a  (M)  predominate  in  primordial  water,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  other  two, <br/>and  sealed  the  earth  in  the  universe  (including  land  and  sea),  coldness  in  the  year,  and  the  abdomen <br/>in  man  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>9.  He  let  the  letter  ^  (Sh)  predominate  in  primordial  fire,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  other  two, <br/>and  sealed  heaven  in  the  universe,  heat  in  the  year,  and  the  head  of  man  (male  and  female). <br/><br/><br/>Chapter  Four <br/><br/><br/>1.  The  seven  double  letters,  n  i  d  d  t  :i  3  (B,  G,  D,  K,  P,  R,  Th),  have  a  duplicity  of  pronunciation  (two <br/>voices),  aspirated  and  unaspirated,  namely:  s  :i  J  ,T7  ,d  3  ,3  9  ,&quot;i  i  ,nThey  serve  as  a  model  of  softness <br/>and  hardness,  strength  and  weakness. <br/><br/>2.  The  seven  double  letters  symbolize  wisdom,  riches,  fertility  life,  power,  peace,  and  grace. <br/><br/>3.  The  seven  double  letters  also  signify  the  antitheses  to  which  human  life  is  exposed.  The  opposite  of <br/>wisdom  is  foolishness;  of  riches,  poverty;  of  fertility,  sterility;  of  life,  death;  of  power,  servitude;  of <br/>peace,  war;  and  of  beauty,  deformity. <br/><br/>4.  The  seven  double  letters  point  out  the  six  dimensions,  height,  depth.  East  and  West,  North  and <br/>South,  and  the  Holy  Temple  in  the  center,  which  sustains  them  all. <br/><br/>5.  The  double  letters  are  seven  and  not  six,  they  are  seven  and  not  eight;  reflect  upon  this  fact,  search <br/>into  it  and  reveal  its  hidden  mystery  and  place  the  Creator  on  His  throne  again. <br/><br/>6.  The  seven  double  letters  having  been  designed,  established,  purified,  weighed,  and  exchanged  by <br/>God,  He  formed  of  them  seven  planets  in  the  universe,  seven  days  in  the  Year,  and  seven  gateways  of <br/>the  senses  in  man  (male  and  female).  From  these  seven  He  also  produced  seven  heavens,  seven  earths, <br/>and  seven  Sabbaths.  Therefore  He  loved  seven  more  than  any  other  number  beneath  His  throne. <br/><br/>7.  The  seven  planets  in  the  universe  are:  Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  Sun,  Venus,  Mercury,  and  Moon.  The <br/>seven  days  in  the  Year  are  the  seven  days  of  the  week  (possibly  the  seven  creative  days  are  meant). <br/>The  seven  gateways  in  man  (male  and  female)  are  two  eyes,  two  ears,  two  nostrils,  and  the  mouth. <br/><br/>8.  NOTE.  Knut  Stenring  differs  from  other  authorities  in  his  arrangement  of  the  planets  and  days  of <br/>the  week  in  the  following  seven  stanzas.  Kircher  has  still  a  different  order.  Rev.  Dr.  Isidor  Kalisch, <br/>Wm.  Wynn  Westcott,  and  The  Sacred  Books  and  Early  Literature  of  the  East  adopt  the  following <br/>arrangement. <br/><br/><br/>THE  HEBREW  LETTERS  ACCORDING  TO  THE  SEPHER  YETZIRAH. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  central  triangle  are  the  three  Mother  Letters  from  which  come  forth  the  seven  Double  Letters&#x2014;the  planets  and  the <br/>heavens.  Surrounding  the  black  star  are  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  symbolized  by  the  twelve  Simple  Letters.  In  the  midst  of <br/>this  star  is  the  Invisible  Throne  of  the  Most  Ancient  of  the  Ancients&#x2014;the  Supreme  Definitionless  Creator. <br/><br/><br/>p.  116 <br/><br/><br/>1st.  He  caused  the  letter,  n  (B)  to  predominate  in  wisdom,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  the  Moon  in  the  universe,  the  first  day  in  the  year,  and  the  right  eye  in  man <br/>(male  and  female). <br/><br/>2nd.  He  caused  the  letter  :i  (G)  to  predominate  in  riches,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  Mars  in  the  universe,  the  second  day  in  the  year,  and  the  right  ear  in  man  (male <br/>and  female). <br/><br/>3rd.  He  caused  the  letter  i  (D)  to  predominate  infertility,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  the  Sun  in  the  universe,  the  third  day  in  the  year,  and  the  right  nostril  in  man <br/>(male  and  female). <br/><br/>4th.  He  caused  the  letters  (K)  to  predominate  in  life,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others,  and <br/>formed  by  them  Venus  in  the  universe,  the  fourth  day  in  the  year,  and  the  left  eye  in  man  (male  and <br/>female). <br/><br/>5th.  He  caused  the  letter  d  (P)  to  predominate  in  power,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  Mercury  in  the  universe,  the  fifth  day  in  the  year,  and  the  left  ear  in  man  (male <br/>and  female). <br/><br/>6th.  He  caused  the  letter  i  (R)  to  predominate  in  peace,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  Saturn  in  the  universe,  the  sixth  day  in  the  year,  and  the  left  nostril  in  man  (male <br/>and  female). <br/><br/>7th.  He  caused  the  letter  n  (Th)  to  predominate  in  grace,  crowned  it,  combined  each  with  the  others, <br/>and  formed  by  them  Jupiter  in  the  universe,  the  seventh  day  in  the  year,  and  the  mouth  of  man  (male <br/>and  female). <br/><br/>9.  With  the  seven  double  letters  He  also  designed  seven  earths,  seven  heavens,  seven  continents, <br/>seven  seas,  seven  rivers,  seven  deserts,  seven  days,  seven  weeks  (from  Passover  to  Pentecost),  and  in <br/>the  midst  of  them  His  Holy  Palace.  There  is  a  q^cle  of  seven  years  and  the  seventh  is  the  release  year, <br/>and  after  seven  release  years  is  the  Jubilee.  For  this  reason  God  loves  the  number  seven  more  than <br/>any  other  thing  under  the  heavens. <br/><br/>10.  In  this  manner  God  joined  the  seven  double  letters  together.  Two  stones  build  two  houses,  three <br/>stones  build  six  houses,  four  stones  build  twenty-four  houses,  five  stones  build  120  houses,  six  stones <br/>build  720  houses,  and  seven  stones  build  5,040  houses.  Make  a  beginning  according  to  this <br/>arrangement  and  reckon  further  than  the  mouth  can  express  or  the  ear  can  hear. <br/><br/>Chapter  Five <br/><br/>1.  The  twelve  simple  letters  p  ^  y  o  ]   '  0  n  n  n  (H,  V,  Z,  Ch,  T,  I,  L,  N,  S,  O,  Tz,  Q)  symbolize  the  twelve <br/>fundamental  properties:  speech,  thought,  movement,  sight,  hearing,  work,  coition,  smell,  sleep,  anger, <br/>taste  (or  swallowing),  and  mirth. <br/><br/>2.  The  simple  letters  correspond  to  twelve  directions:  east  height,  northeast,  east  depth;  south  height, <br/>southeast,  south  depth;  west  height,  southwest,  west  depth;  north  height,  northwest,  north  depth. <br/>They  diverge  to  all  eternity  and  are  the  arms  of  the  universe. <br/><br/><br/>3.  The  simple  letters  having  been  designed,  established,  weighed,  and  exchanged  by  God,  He <br/>produced  by  them  twelve  zodiacal  signs  in  the  universe,  twelve  months  in  the  year,  and  twelve  chief <br/>organs  in  '  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>4.  The  signs  of  the  zodiac  are:  Aries,  Taurus,  Gemini,  Cancer,  Leo,  Virgo,  Libra,  Scorpio,  Sagittarius, <br/>Capricorn,  Aquarius,  and  Pisces.  The  months  of  the  year  are:  Nisan,  liar,  Sivan,  Tammuz,  Ab,  Elul, <br/>Tisri,  Marcheshvan,  Kislev,  Tebet,  Sebat,  and  Adar.  The  organs  of  the  human  body  are:  two  hands, <br/>two  feet,  two  kidneys,  gall,  small  intestine,  liver,  esophagus,  stomach,  and  spleen. <br/><br/>5.  NOTE.  In  the  following  twelve  stanzas,  Knut  Stenring  again  differs,  this  time  as  to  the  arrangement <br/>of  properties: <br/><br/>1st.  God  caused  the  letter  n  (H)  to  predominate  in  speech,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others, <br/>and  fashioned  by  them  Aries  (the  Ram)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Nisan  in  the  year,  and  the  right <br/>foot  of  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>2nd.  He  caused  the  letter  i  (V)  to  predominate  in  thought,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others, <br/>and  fashioned  by  them  Taurus  (the  Bull)  in  the  universe,  the  month  liar  in  the  year,  and  the  right <br/>kidney  of  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>3rd.  He  caused  the  letter  t  (Z)  to  predominate  in  movement,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others, <br/>and  fashioned  by  them  Gemini  (the  Twins)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Sivan  in  the  year,  and  the  left <br/>foot  of  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>4th.  He  caused  the  letter  n  (Ch)  to  predominate  in  sight,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Cancer  (the  Crab)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Tammuz  in  the  year,  and  the  right <br/>hand  of  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>5th.  He  caused  the  letter  d  (T)  to  predominate  in  hearing,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Leo  (the  Lion)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Ab  in  the  year,  and  the  left  kidney  of  the <br/>human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>6th.  He  caused  the  letter '  (I)  to  predominate  in  work,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Virgo  (the  Virgin)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Elul  in  the  year,  and  the  left  hand  of <br/>the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>Zth.  He  caused  the  letter  (L)  to  predominate  in  coition,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Libra  (the  Balance)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Tisri  in  the  year,  and  the  gall  of  the <br/>human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>8th.  He  caused  the  letter  ]  (N)  to  predominate  in  smell,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Scorpio  (the  Scorpion)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Marcheshvan  in  the  year,  and <br/>the  small  intestine  in  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>gth.  He  caused  the  letter  o  (S)  to  predominate  in  sleep,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Sagittarius  (the  Archer)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Kislev  in  the  year,  and  the <br/>stomach  in  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>10th.  He  caused  the  letter  y  (O)  to  predominate  in  anger,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Capricorn  (the  Goat)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Tebet  in  the  year,  and  the  liver  in <br/>the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/><br/>nth.  He  caused  the  letter  5J  (Tz)  to  predominate  in  taste  (or  swallowing),  crowned  it,  combined  it  with <br/>the  others,  and  fashioned  by  them  Aquarius  (the  Water  Bearer)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Sebat  in <br/>the  year,  and  the  esophagus  in  the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>12th.  He  caused  the  letter  p  (Q)  to  predominate  in  mirth,  crowned  it,  combined  it  with  the  others,  and <br/>fashioned  by  them  Pisces  (the  Fishes)  in  the  universe,  the  month  Adar  in  the  year,  and  the  spleen  in <br/>the  human  body  (male  and  female). <br/><br/>6.  He  made  them  as  a  conflict.  He  arranged  them  as  provinces  and  drew  them  up  like  a  wall.  He <br/>armed  them  and  set  one  against  another  as  in  warfare.  (The  Elohim  did  likewise  in  the  other  spheres.) <br/><br/>Chapter  Six <br/><br/>1.  There  are  three  Mothers  or  first  elements,  tz?  a  x  (A,  M,  Sh),  from  which  emanated  three  Fathers <br/>(progenitors)&#x2014; primordial  (spiritual)  air,  water,  and  fire&#x2014;from  which  issued  the  seven  planets <br/>(heavens)  with  their  angels,  and  the  twelve  oblique  points  (zodiac). <br/><br/>2.  To  prove  this  there  are  three  faithful  witnesses:  the  universe,  the  year,  and  man.  There  are  the <br/>twelve,  the  balance,  and  the  seven.  Above  is  the  Dragon,  below  is  the  world,  and  lastly  the  heart  of <br/>man;  and  in  the  midst  is  God  who  regulates  them  all. <br/><br/>3.  The  first  elements  are  air,  water,  and  fire;  the  fire  is  above,  the  water  is  below,  and  a  breath  of  air <br/>establishes  balance  between  them.  The  token  is:  the  fire  carries  the  water.  The  letters  (M)  is  mute;  ^ <br/>(Sh)  is  hissing  like  fire;  there  is  X  (A)  among  them,  a  breath  of  air  which  reconciles  the  two. <br/><br/>4.  The  Dragon  (Tali)  is  in  the  universe  like  a  king  upon  his  throne;  the  celestial  sphere  is  in  the  year <br/>like  a  king  in  his  empire;  and  the  heart  is  in  the  body  of  men  like  a  king  in  warfare. <br/><br/>5.  God  also  set  the  opposites  against  each  other:  the  good  against  the  evil,  and  the  evil  against  the <br/>good.  Good  proceeds  from  good,  evil  from  evil;  the  good  purifies  the  bad,  the  bad  the  good.  The  good <br/>is  reserved  for  the  good,  and  the  evil  for  the  wicked. <br/><br/>6.  There  are  three  of  which  each  stands  by  itself:  one  is  in  the  affirmative  (filled  with  good),  one  is  in <br/>the  negative  (filled  with  evil),  and  the  third  equilibrates  them. <br/><br/>7.  There  are  seven  divided  three  against  three,  and  one  in  the  midst  of  them  (balance).  Twelve  stand <br/>in  warfare:  three  produce  love  and  three  hatred;  three  are  life-givers  and  three  are  destroyers. <br/><br/>8.  The  three  that  cause  love  are  the  heart  and  the  two  ears;  the  three  that  produce  hatred  are  the  liver, <br/>the  gall,  and  the  tongues;  the  three  life-givers  are  the  two  nostrils  and  the  spleen;  and  the  three <br/>destroyers  are  the  mouth  and  the  two  lower  openings  of  the  body.  Over  all  these  rules  God,  the <br/>faithful  king,  from  His  holy  habitation  in  all  eternity.  God  is  One  above  three,  three  are  above  seven, <br/>seven  are  above  twelve,  yet  all  are  linked  together. <br/><br/>9.  There  are  twenty-two  letters  by  which  the  I  AM  (YAH),  the  Lord  of  Hosts,  Almighty  and  Eternal, <br/>designed  and  created  by  three  Sepharim  (Numbers,  Letters,  and  Sounds)  His  universe,  and  formed  by <br/>them  all  creatures  and  all  those  things  that  are  yet  to  come. <br/><br/>10.  When  the  Patriarch  Abraham  had  comprehended  the  great  truths,  meditated  upon  them,  and <br/>understood  them  perfectly,  the  Lord  of  the  Universe  (the  Tetragrammaton)  appeared  to  him,  called <br/>him  His  friend,  kissed  him  upon  the  head,  and  made  with  him  a  covenant.  First,  the  covenant  was <br/>between  the  ten  fingers  of  his  hands,  which  is  the  covenant  of  the  tongue  (spiritual);  second,  the <br/>covenant  was  between  the  ten  toes  of  his  feet,  which  is  the  covenant  of  circumcision  (material);  and <br/><br/><br/>God  said  of  him,  &quot;Before  Abraham  bound  the  spirit  of  the  twenty-two  letters  (the  Thora)  upon  his <br/><br/>tongue  and  God  disclosed  to  him  their  secrets.  God  permitted  the  letters  to  be  immersed  in  water,  He <br/>burned  them  in  the  fire  and  imprinted  them  upon  the  winds.  He  distributed  them  among  the  seven <br/>planets  and  gave  them  to  the  twelve  zodiacal  signs. <br/><br/><br/>p.  117 <br/><br/><br/>Fundamentals  of  Qabbalistic  Cosmogony <br/><br/>THE  Qabbalists  conceive  of  the  Supreme  Deity  as  an  Incomprehensible  Principle  to  be  discovered <br/>only  through  the  process  of  eliminating,  in  order,  all  its  cognizable  attributes.  That  which  remains&#x2014; <br/>when  every  knowable  thing  has  been  removed&#x2014;is  AIN  SOPH,  the  eternal  state  of  Being.  Although <br/>indefinable,  the  Absolute  permeates  all  space.  Abstract  to  the  degree  of  inconceivability,  AIN  SOPH  is <br/>the  unconditioned  state  of  all  things.  Substances,  essences,  and  intelligences  are  manifested  out  of <br/>the  inscrutability  of  AIN  SOPH,  but  the  Absolute  itself  is  without  substance,  essence,  or  intelligence. <br/>AIN  SOPH  may  be  likened  to  a  great  field  of  rich  earth  out  of  which  rises  a  myriad  of  plants,  each <br/>different  in  color,  formation,  and  fragrance,  yet  each  with  its  roots  in  the  same  dark  loam&#x2014;which, <br/>however,  is  unlike  any  of  the  forms  nurtured  by  it.  The  &quot;plants&quot;  are  universes,  gods,  and  man,  all <br/>nourished  by  AIN  SOPH  and  all  with  their  source  in  one  definitionless  essence;  all  with  their  spirits, <br/>souls,  and  bodies  fashioned  from  this  essence,  and  doomed,  like  the  plant,  to  return  to  the  black <br/>ground&#x2014; AIN  SOPH,  the  only  Immortal&#x2014; whence  they  came. <br/><br/>AIN  SOPH  was  referred  to  by  the  Qabbalists  as  The  Most  Ancient  of  all  the  Ancients.  It  was  always <br/>considered  as  sexless.  Its  symbol  was  a  closed  eye.  While  it  may  be  truly  said  of  AIN  SOPH  that  to <br/>define  It  is  to  defile  It,  the  Rabbis  postulated  certain  theories  regarding  the  manner  in  which  AIN <br/>SOPH  projected  creations  out  of  Itself,  and  they  also  assigned  to  this  Absolute  Not-Being  certain <br/>symbols  as  being  descriptive,  in  part  at  least,  of  Its  powers.  The  nature  of  AIN  SOPH  they  symbolize <br/>by  a  circle,  itself  emblematic  of  eternity.  This  hypothetical  circle  encloses  a  dimensionless  area  of <br/>incomprehensible  life,  and  the  circular  boundary  of  this  life  is  abstract  and  measureless  infinity. <br/><br/>According  to  this  concept,  God  is  not  only  a  Center  but  also  Area.  Centralization  is  the  first  step <br/>towards  limitation.  Therefore,  centers  which  form  in  the  substances  of  AIN  SOPH  are  finite  because <br/>they  are  predestined  to  dissolution  back  into  the  Cause  of  themselves,  while  AIN  SOPH  Itself  is <br/>infinite  because  It  is  the  ultimate  condition  of  all  things.  The  circular  shape  given  to  AIN  SOPH <br/>signifies  that  space  is  hypothetically  enclosed  within  a  great  crystal-like  globe,  outside  of  which  there <br/>is  nothing,  not  even  a  vacuum.  Within  this  globe&#x2014; symbolic  of  AIN  SOPH&#x2014; creation  and  dissolution <br/>take  place.  Every  element  and  principle  that  will  ever  be  used  in  the  eternities  of  Kosmic  birth,  growth, <br/>and  decay  is  within  the  transparent  substances  of  this  intangible  sphere.  It  is  the  Kosmic  Egg  which  is <br/>not  broken  till  the  great  day  &quot;Be  With  Us,&quot;  which  is  the  end  of  the  Cycle  of  Necessity,  when  all  things <br/>return  to  their  ultimate  cause. <br/><br/>In  the  process  of  creation  the  diffused  life  of  AIN  SOPH  retires  from  the  circumference  to  the  center <br/>of  the  circle  and  establishes  a  point,  which  is  the  first  manifesting  One&#x2014; the  primitive  limitation  of  the <br/>all-pervading  O.  When  the  Divine  Essence  thus  retires  from  the  circular  boundary  to  the  center.  It <br/>leaves  behind  the  Abyss,  or,  as  the  Qabbalists  term  it,  the  Great  Privation.  Thus,  in  AIN  SOPH  is <br/>established  a  twofold  condition  where  previously  had  existed  but  one.  The  first  condition  is  the <br/>central  point&#x2014; the  primitive  objectified  radiance  of  the  eternal,  subjectified  life.  About  this  radiance  is <br/>darkness  caused  by  the  deprivation  of  the  life  which  is  drawn  to  the  center  to  create  the  first  point,  or <br/>universal  germ.  The  universal  AIN  SOPH,  therefore,  no  longer  shines  through  space,  but  rather  upon <br/>space  from  an  established  first  point.  Isaac  Myer  describes  this  process  as  follows:  &quot;The  Ain  Soph  at <br/>first  was  filling  All  and  then  made  an  absolute  concentration  into  Itself  which  produced  the  Abyss, <br/>Deep,  or  Space,  the  Aveer  Qadmon  or  Primitive  Air,  the  Azoth;  but  this  is  not  considered  in  the <br/>Qabbalah  as  a  perfect  void  or  vacuum,  a  perfectly  empty  Space,  but  is  thought  of  as  the  Waters  or <br/>Crystalline  Chaotic  Sea,  in  which  was  a  certain  degree  of  Light  inferior  to  that  by  which  all  the  created <br/>[worlds  and  hierarchies]  were  made.&quot;  (See  The  Qabbalah.) <br/><br/><br/>In  the  secret  teachings  of  the  Qabbalah  it  is  taught  that  man's  body  is  enveloped  in  an  ovoid  of <br/>bubble-hke  iridescence,  which  is  called  the  Auric  Egg.  This  is  the  causal  sphere  of  man.  It  bears  the <br/>same  relationship  to  man's  physical  body  that  the  globe  of  AIN  SOPH  bears  to  Its  created  universes. <br/>In  fact,  this  Auric  Egg  is  the  AIN  SOPH  sphere  of  the  entity  called  man.  In  reality,  therefore,  the <br/>supreme  consciousness  of  man  is  in  this  aura,  which  extends  in  all  directions  and  completely  encircles <br/>his  lower  bodies.  As  the  consciousness  in  the  Kosmic  Egg  is  withdrawn  into  a  central  point,  which  is <br/>then  called  God&#x2014;the  Supreme  One&#x2014;so  the  consciousness  in  the  Auric  Egg  of  man  is  concentrated, <br/>thereby  causing  the  establishment  of  a  point  of  consciousness  called  the  Ego.  As  the  universes  in <br/>Nature  are  formed  from  powers  latent  in  the  Kosmic  Egg,  so  everything  used  by  man  in  all  his <br/>incarnations  throughout  the  kingdoms  of  Nature  is  drawn  from  the  latent  powers  within  his  Auric <br/>Egg.  Man  never  passes  from  this  egg;  it  remains  even  after  death.  His  births,  deaths,  and  rebirths  all <br/>take  place  within  it,  and  it  cannot  be  broken  until  the  lesser  day  &quot;Be  With  Us,&quot;  when  mankind&#x2014; like <br/>the  universe&#x2014; is  liberated  from  the  Wheel  of  Necessity. <br/><br/>THE  QABBALISTIC  SYSTEM  OF  WORLDS <br/><br/>On  the  accompanying  circular  chart,  the  concentric  rings  represent  diagrammatically  the  forty  rates <br/>of  vibration  (called  by  the  Qabbalists  Spheres)  which  emanate  from  AIN  SOPH.  The  circle  X  i  is  the <br/>outer  boundary  of  space.  It  circumscribes  the  area  of  AIN  SOPH.  The  nature  of  AIN  SOPH  Itself  is <br/>divided  into  three  parts,  represented  by  the  spaces  respectively  between  X  i  and  X  2,  X  2  and  X  3,  X  3 <br/>and  A 1;  thus: <br/><br/><br/>X 1  to  X  2, <br/><br/>AIN,  the  vacuum  of  pure  spirit. <br/><br/>X  2  to  X  3, <br/><br/>AIN  SOPH,  the  Limitless  and  Boundless. <br/><br/>X  3  to  A 1, <br/><br/>nx  n^D  v^, <br/><br/>AIN  SOPH  AUR,  the  Limitless  Light.  J <br/><br/>It  should  be  borne  in  mind  that  in  the  beginning  the  Supreme  Substance,  AIN,  alone  permeated  the <br/>area  of  the  circle;  the  inner  rings  had  not  yet  come  into  manifestation.  As  the  Divine  Essence <br/>concentrated  Itself,  the  rings  X  2  and  X  3  became  apprehensible,  for  AIN  SOPH  is  a  limitation  of  AIN, <br/>and  AIN  SOPH  AUR,  or  Light,  is  a  still  greater  limitation.  Thus  the  nature  of  the  Supreme  One  is <br/>considered  to  be  threefold,  and  from  this  threefold  nature  the  powers  and  elements  of  creation  were <br/>reflected  into  the  Abyss  left  by  the  motion  of  AIN  SOPH  towards  the  center  of  Itself.  The  continual <br/>motion  of  AIN  SOPH  towards  the  center  of  Itself  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  the  dot  in  the  circle. <br/>The  dot  was  called  God,  as  being  the  supreme  individualization  of  the  Universal  Essence.  Concerning <br/>this  the  Zohar  says: <br/><br/>&quot;When  the  concealed  of  the  Concealed  wished  to  reveal  Himself  He  first  made  a  single  point:  the <br/>Infinite  was  entirely  unknown,  and  diffused  no  light  before  this  luminous  point  violently  broke <br/>through  into  vision.&quot; <br/><br/>The  name  of  this  point  is  I  AM,  called  by  the  Hebrews  Eheieh.  The  Qabbalists  gave  many  names  to <br/>this  dot.  On  this  subject  Christian  D.  Ginsberg  writes,  in  substance:  The  dot  is  called  the  first  crown, <br/>because  it  occupies  the  highest  position.  It  is  called  the  aged,  because  it  is  the  first  emanation.  It  is <br/>called  the  primordial  or  smooth  point.  It  is  called  the  white  head,  the  Long  Face&#x2014; Macroprosophus&#x2014; <br/>and  the  inscrutable  height,  because  it  controls  and  governs  all  the  other  emanations. <br/><br/>When  the  white  shining  point  had  appeared,  it  was  called  Kether,  which  means  the  Crown,  and  out  of <br/>it  radiated  nine  great  globes,  which  arranged  themselves  in  the  form  of  a  tree.  These  nine  together <br/>with  the  first  crown  constituted  the  first  system  of  Sephiroth.  These  ten  were  the  first  limitation  of  ten <br/>abstract  points  within  the  nature  of  AIN  SOPH  Itself.  The  power  of  AIN  SOPH  did  not  descend  into <br/>these  globes  but  rather  was  reflected  upon  them  as  the  light  of  the  sun  is  reflected  upon  the  earth  and <br/><br/><br/>planets.  These  ten  globes  were  called  the  shining  sapphires,  and  it  is  believed  by  many  Rabbins  that <br/><br/>the  word  sapphire  is  the  basis  of  the  word  Sephira  (the  singular  of  Sephiroth).  The  great  area  which <br/>had  been  privated  by  the  withdrawal  of  AIN  SOPH  into  the  central  point,  Kether,  was  now  filled  by <br/>four  concentric  globes  called  worlds,  or  spheres,  and  the  light  of  the  ten  Sephiroth  was  reflected  down <br/>through  each  of  these  in  turn.  This  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  four  symbolical <br/><br/><br/>THE  HEBREW  TRIAD. <br/><br/><br/>The  Qabbalists  used  the  letter  ^,  Shin,  to  signify  the  trinity  of  the  first  three  Sephiroth.  The  central  circle  slightly  above  the <br/>other  two  is  the  first  Sephira&#x2014;iCet/ier,  the  White  Head,  the  Crown.  The  other  two  circles  represent  Chochmah,  the  Father, <br/>and  Binah,  the  Mother.  From  the  union  of  the  Divine  Father  and  the  Divine  Mother  are  produced  the  worlds  and  the <br/>generations  of  living  things.  The  three  flame-like  points  of  the  letter  n;  have  long  been  used  to  conceal  this  Creative  Triad <br/>of  the  Qabbalists. <br/><br/>p.  118 <br/><br/>trees,  each  hearing  the  reflections  of  the  ten  Sephirothic  globes.  The  40  spheres  of  creation  out  of  AIN <br/>SOPH  are  divided  into  four  great  world  chains,  as  follows: <br/><br/>A 1  to  A 10,  Atziluth,  the  Boundless  World  of  Divine  Names. <br/><br/>B  1  to  B  10,  Briah,  the  Archangelic  World  of  Creations. <br/><br/>C 1  to  C 10,  Yetzirah,  the  Hierarchal  World  of  Formations. <br/><br/>D  1  to  D  10,  Assiah,  the  Elemental  World  of  Substances. <br/><br/>Each  of  these  worlds  has  ten  powers,  or  spheres&#x2014;a  parent  globe  and  nine  others  which  conic  out  of  it <br/>as  emanations,  each  globe  born  out  of  the  one  preceding.  On  the  plane  of  Atziluth  (A  1  to  A 10),  the <br/>highest  and  most  divine  of  all  the  created  worlds,  the  unmanifested  AIN  SOPH  established  His  first <br/>point  or  dot  in  the  Divine  Sea&#x2014;the  three  spheres  of  X.  This  dot &#x2014;A  i~contains  all  creation  within  it, <br/>but  in  this  first  divine  and  uncontaminated  state  the  dot,  or  first  manifested.  God,  was  not  considered <br/>as  a  personality  by  the  Qabbalists  but  rather  as  a  divine  establishment  or  foundation.  It  was  called  the <br/>First  Crown  and  from  it  issued  the  other  circles  of  the  Atziluthic  World:  A  2,  A  3,  A  4,  A  5,  A  6,  A  7,  A <br/>8,  A  9,  and  A 10.  In  the  three  lower  worlds  these  circles  are  intelligences,  planers,  and  elements,  but <br/>in  this  first  divine  world  they  are  called  the  Rings  of  the  Sacred  Names. <br/><br/>The  first  ten  great  circles  (or  globes)  of  light  which  were  manifested  out  of  AIN  SOPH  and  the  ten <br/>names  of  God  assigned  to  them  by  the  Qabbalists  are  as  follows: <br/><br/>From  AIN  SOPH  came  A 1,  the  First  Crown,  and  the  name  of  the  first  power  of  God  was  Eheieh,  which <br/>means  I  Am  [That  I  Am]. <br/><br/><br/>From  A  i  came  A  2,  the  first  Wisdom,  and  the  name  of  the  second  power  of  God  was  Jehovah,  which <br/>means  Essence  of  Being. <br/><br/>From  A  2  came  A  3,  the  first  Understanding,  and  the  name  of  the  third  power  of  God  was  Jehovah <br/>Elohim,  which  means  God  of  Gods. <br/><br/>From  A  3  came  A  4,  the  first  Mercy,  and  the  name  of  the  fourth  power  of  God  was  El,  which  means <br/>God  the  Creator. <br/><br/>From  A  4  came  A  5,  the  first  Severity,  and  the  name  of  the  fifth  power  of  God  was  Elohim  Gibor, <br/>which  means  God  the  Potent. <br/><br/>From  A  5  came  A  6,  the  first  Beauty,  and  the  name  of  the  sixth  power  of  God  was  Eloah  Vadaath, <br/>which  means  God  the  Strong. <br/><br/>From  A  6  came  A  7,  the  first  Victory,  and  the  name  of  the  seventh  power  of  God  was  Jehovah <br/>Tzaboath,  which  means  God  of  Hosts. <br/><br/>From  A  7  came  A  8,  the  first  Glory,  and  the  name  of  the  eighth  power  of  God  was  Elohim  Tzaboath, <br/>which  means  Lord  God  of  Hosts. <br/><br/>From  A  8  came  A  9,  the  first  Foundation,  and  the  name  of  the  ninth  power  of  God  was  Shaddai,  El <br/>Chai,  which  means  Omnipotent. <br/><br/>From  A  9  came  A 10,  the  first  Kingdom,  and  the  name  of  the  tenth  power  of  God  was  Adonai  Melekh, <br/>which  means  God. <br/><br/>From  A 10  came  B  1,  the  Second  Crown,  and  the  World  of  Briah  was  established. <br/><br/>The  ten  emanations  from  A 1  to  A 10  inclusive  are  called  the  foundations  of  all  creations.  The <br/>Qabbalists  designate  them  the  ten  roots  of  the  Tree  of  Life.  They  are  arranged  in  the  form  of  a  great <br/>human  figure  called  Adam  Qadmon~the  man  made  from  the  fire  mist  (red  dirt),  the  prototypic <br/>Universal  Man.  In  the  Atziluthic  World,  the  powers  of  God  are  most  purely  manifested.  These  ten <br/>pure  and  perfect  radiations  do  not  descend  into  the  lower  worlds  and  take  upon  themselves  forms, <br/>but  are  reflected  upon  the  substances  of  the  inferior  spheres.  From  the  first,  or  Atziluthic,  World  they <br/>are  reflected  into  the  second,  or  Briatic,  World.  As  the  reflection  always  lacks  some  of  the  brilliancy  of <br/>the  original  image,  so  in  the  Briatic  World  the  ten  radiations  lose  part  of  their  infinite  power.  A <br/>reflection  is  always  like  the  thing  reflected,  but  smaller  and  fainter. <br/><br/>In  the  second  world,  B  1  to  B  10,  the  order  of  the  spheres  is  the  Name  as  in  the  Atziluthic  World,  but <br/>the  ten  circles  of  light  are  less  brilliant  and  more  tangible,  and  are  here  referred  to  as  ten  great <br/>Spirits&#x2014;divine  creatures  who  assist  in  the  establishment  of  order  and  intelligence  in  the  universe.  As <br/>already  noted,  B  1  is  born  out  of  A 10  and  is  included  within  all  the  spheres  superior  to  itself.  Out  of  B <br/>1  are  taken  nine  globes~B  2,  B  3,  B  4,  B  5,  B  6,  B  7,  B  8,  B  9,  and  B  io~which  constitute  the  World  of <br/>Briah.  These  ten  subdivisions,  however,  are  really  the  ten  Atziluthic  powers  reflected  into  the <br/>substance  of  the  Briatic  World.  B  1  is  the  ruler  of  this  world,  for  it  contains  all  the  other  rings  of  its <br/>own  world  and  also  the  rings  of  the  third  and  fourth  worlds,  C  and  D.  In  the  World  of  Briah  the  ten <br/>spheres  of  light  are  called  the  Archangels  of  Briah.  Their  order  and  powers  are  as  follows: <br/><br/>From  A 10  came  B  1,  the  Second  Crown;  it  is  called  Metatron,  the  Angel  of  the  Presence. <br/><br/>From  B  1  came  B  2,  the  second  Wisdom;  it  is  called  Raziel,  the  Herald  of  Deity  who  revealed  the <br/>mysteries  of  Qabbalah  to  Adam. <br/><br/><br/>From  B  2  carne  B  3,  the  second  Understanding;  it  is  called  Tsaphkiel,  the  Contemplation  of  God. <br/><br/>From  B  3  came  B  4  '  the  second  Mercy;  it  is  called  Tsadkiel,  the  justice  of  God. <br/><br/>From  B  4  came  B  5,  the  second  Severity;  it  is  called  Samael,  the  Severity  of  God. <br/><br/>From  B  5  came  B  6,  the  second  Beauty;  it  is  called  Michael,  Like  Unto  God. <br/><br/>From  B  6  came  B  7,  the  second  Victory;  it  is  called  Haniel,  the  Grace  of  God. <br/><br/>From  B  7  came  B  8,  the  second  Glory;  it  is  called  Raphael,  the  Divine  Physician. <br/><br/>From  B  8  came  B  9,  the  second  Foundation;  it  is  called  Gabriel,  the  Man-God. <br/><br/>From  B  9  came  B  10,  the  second  Kingdom;  it  is  called  Sandalphon,  the  Messias. <br/><br/>From  B  10  came  C  1,  the  Third  Crown,  and  the  World  of  Yetzirah  was  established. <br/><br/>The  ten  Archangels  of  Briah  are  conceived  to  be  ten  great  spiritual  beings,  whose  duty  is  to  manifest <br/>the  ten  powers  of  the  Great  Name  of  God  existent  in  the  Atziluthic  World,  which  surrounds  and <br/>interpenetrates  the  entire  world  of  creation.  All  things  manifesting  in  the  lower  worlds  exist  first  in <br/>the  intangible  rings  of  the  upper  spheres,  so  that  creation  is,  in  truth,  the  process  of  making  tangible <br/>the  intangible  by  extending  the  intangible  into  various  vibratory  rates.  The  ten  globes  of  Briatic <br/>power,  while  themselves  reflections,  are  mirrored  downward  into  the  third  or  Yetziratic  World,  where <br/>still  more  limited  in  their  expression  they  become  the  spiritual  and  invisible  zodiac  which  is  behind <br/>the  visible  band  of  constellations.  In  this  third  world  the  ten  globes  of  the  original  Atziluthic  World <br/>are  greatly  limited  and  dimmed,  but  they  are  still  infinitely  powerful  in  comparison  with  the  state  of <br/>substance  in  which  man  dwells.  In  the  third  world,  C  1  to  C  10,  the  globes  become  hierarchies  of <br/>celestial  creatures,  called  the  Choirs  of  Yetzirah.  Here  again,  all  are  included  within  the  ring  C  1,  the <br/>power  which  controls  the  Yetziratic  World  and  which  includes  within  itself  and  controls  the  entire <br/>world  D.  The  order  of  the  globes  and  the  names  of  the  hierarchies  composing  them  are  as  follows: <br/><br/>From  B  10  came  C  1,  the  Third  Crown;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Cherubim,  Chaioth  Ha  Kadosh,  the  Holy <br/>Animals. <br/><br/>From  C 1  came  C  2,  the  third  Wisdom;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Cherubim,  Orphanim,  the  Wheels. <br/><br/>From  C  2  came  C  3,  the  third  Understanding;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Thrones,  Aralim,  the  Mighty  Ones. <br/><br/>From  C  3  came  C  4,  the  third  Mercy;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Dominations,  Chashmalim,  the  Brilliant <br/>Ones. <br/><br/>From  C  4  came  C  5,  the  third  Severity;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Powers,  Seraphim,  the  Flaming  Serpents. <br/>From  C  5  came  C  6,  the  third  Beauty;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Virtues,  Melachim,  the  Kings. <br/>From  C  6  came  C  7,  the  third  Victory;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Principalities,  Elohim,  the  Gods. <br/>From  C  7  came  C  8,  the  third  Glory;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Archangels,  Ben  Elohim,  the  Sons  of  God. <br/>From  C  8  came  C  9,  the  third  Foundation;  the  Hierarchy  is  the  Angels,  Cherubim,  the  Scat  of  the  Sons. <br/><br/><br/>From  C  9  came  C 10,  the  third  Kingdom;  the  Hierarchy  is  Humanity,  the  Ishim,  the  Souls  of  Just  Men. <br/><br/>From  C 10  came  D  1,  the  Fourth  Crown,  and  the  World  of  Assiah  was  established. <br/><br/>From  the  Yetziratic  World  the  light  of  the  ten  spheres  is  reflected  into  the  World  of  Assiah,  the  lowest <br/>of  the  four.  The  ten  globes  of  the  original  Atziluthic  World  here  take  upon  themselves  forms  of <br/>physical  matter  and  the  sidereal  system  is  the  result.  The  World  of  Assiah,  or  the  elemental  world  of <br/>substance,  is  the  one  into  which  humanity  descended  at  the  time  of  Adam's  fall.  The  Garden  of  Eden <br/>is  the  three  upper  worlds,  and  for  his  sins  man  was  forced  into  the  sphere  of  substance  and  assumed <br/>coats  of  skin  (bodies).  All  of  the  spiritual  forces  of  the  upper  worlds.  A,  B,  C,  when  they  strike  against <br/>the  elements  of  the  lower  world,  D,  are  distorted  and  perverted,  resulting  in  the  creation  of <br/>hierarchies  of  demons  to  correspond  with  the  good  spirits  in  each  of  the  higher  worlds.  In  all  the <br/>ancient  Mysteries,  matter  was  regarded  as  the  source  of  all  evil  and  spirit  the  source  of  all  good,  for <br/>matter  inhibits  and  limits,  often  so  clogging  the  inner  perceptions  that  man  is  unable  to  recognize  his <br/>own  divine  potentialities.  Since  matter  thus  prevents  humanity  from  claiming  its  birthright,  it  is <br/>called  the  Adversary,  the  power  of  evil.  The  fourth  world,  D,  is  the  world  of  solar  systems. <br/><br/><br/>According  to  the  Qabbalists,  the  hfe  of  the  Supreme  Creator  permeates  all  substance,  all  space,  and  all  time,  but  for <br/>diagrammatic  purposes  the  Supreme,  All-inclusive  Life  is  limited  by  Circle  3,  which  may  be  called  &quot;the  boundary  line  of <br/>Divine  existence.&quot;  The  Divine  Life  permeating  the  area  bounded  by  Circle  3  is  focused  at  Point  1,  which  thus  becomes  the <br/>personification  of  the  impersonal  life  and  is  termed  &quot;the  First  Crown.&quot;  The  creative  forces  pouring  through  Point  1  come <br/>into  manifestation  as  the  objective  universe  in  the  intermediate  space,  Circle  2. <br/><br/><br/>comprising  not  only  the  one  of  which  the  earth  is  a  part  but  all  the  solar  systems  in  the  universe. <br/><br/>Opinions  differ  as  to  the  arrangement  of  the  globes  of  this  last  world,  D  1  to  D  10  inclusive.  The  ruler <br/>of  the  fourth  world  is  D  1,  called  by  some  the  Fiery  Heaven;  by  others  the  Primum  Mobile,  or  the <br/>First  Motion.  From  this  whirling  fire  emanates  the  material  starry  zodiac,  D  2,  in  contradistinction  to <br/>the  invisible  spiritual  zodiac  of  the  Yetziratic  World.  From  the  zodiac,  D  2,  are  differentiated  the <br/>spheres  of  the  planets  in  concatenate  order.  The  ten  spheres  of  the  World  of  Assiah  are  as  follows: <br/><br/>From  C  10  came  D  1,  the  Fourth  Crown;  Rashith  Ha-Galagalum,  the  Primum  Mobile,  the  fiery  mist <br/>which  is  the  beginning  of  the  material  universe. <br/><br/>From  D  1  came  D  2,  the  fourth  Wisdom;  Masloth,  the  Zodiac,  the  Firmament  of  the  Fixed  Stars. <br/>From  D  2  came  D  3,  the  fourth  Understanding;  Shabbathai,  the  sphere  of  Saturn. <br/><br/><br/>3 <br/><br/><br/>THE  PLAN  OF  DIVINE  ACTIVITY. <br/><br/><br/>p.  119 <br/><br/><br/>From  D  3  came  D  4,  the  fourth  Mercy;  Tzedeg,  the  sphere  of  Jupiter. <br/><br/><br/>From  D  4  came  D  5,  the  fourth  Severity;  Madim,  the  sphere  of  Mars. <br/><br/>From  D  5  came  D  6,  the  fourth  Beauty;  Shemesh,  the  sphere  of  the  Sun. <br/><br/>From  D  6  came  D  7,  the  fourth  Victory;  Nog  ah,  the  sphere  of  Venus. <br/><br/>From  D  7  came  D  8,  the  fourth  Glory;  Kokab,  the  sphere  of  Mercury. <br/><br/>From  D  8  came  D  9,  the  fourth  Foundation;  Levanah,  the  sphere  of  the  Moon. <br/><br/>From  D  9  came  D  10,  the  Fourth  Kingdom;  Cholom  Yosodoth,  the  sphere  of  the  Four  Elements. <br/><br/>By  inserting  a  sphere  (which  he  calls  the  Empyrean)  before  the  Primum  Mobile,  Kircher  moves  each <br/>of  the  other  spheres  down  one,  resulting  in  the  elimination  of  the  sphere  of  the  elements  and  making <br/>D  10  the  sphere  of  the  Moon. <br/><br/>In  the  World  of  Assiah  are  to  be  found  the  demons  and  tempters.  These  are  likewise  reflections  of  the <br/>ten  great  globes  oiAtziluth,  but  because  of  the  distortion  of  the  images  resulting  from  the  base <br/><br/>substances  of  the  World  of  Assiah  upon  which  they  are  reflected,  they  become  evil  creatures,  called <br/>shells  by  the  Qabbalists.  There  are  ten  hierarchies  of  these  demons  to  correlate  with  the  ten <br/>hierarchies  of  good  spirits  composing  the  Yetziratic  World.  There  are <br/><br/><br/>THE  QABBALISTIC  SCHEME  OF  THE  FOUR  WORLDS. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  above  chart  the  dark  hne  between  X  3  and  A 1  constitutes  the  boundary  of  the  original  dot,  while  the  concentric <br/>circles  within  this  heavier  line  symbolize  the  emanations  and  the  worlds  which  came  forth  from  the  dot.  As  this  dot  is <br/>contained  within  the  outer  rings  X 1,  X  2,  and  X  3,  and  represents  the  first  establishment  of  an  individualized  existence,  so <br/>the  lower  universe  symbolized  by  the  forty  concentric  circles  within  the  dot  represents  the  lower  creation  evolved  out  of <br/>and  yet  contained  within  the  nature  of  the  first  Crown,  which  may  be  called  God,  within  whom  the  divine  powers,  the <br/>celestial  beings  the  sidereal  worlds,  and  man,  live  and  move  and  have  their  being.  It  is  highly  important  that  all  the  rings <br/>within  A 1  be  considered  as  being  enclosed  by  the  primitive  dot,  which  is  itself  encircled  by  the  great  ring  X 1,  or  the  Auric <br/>Eggof  AIN  SOPH. <br/><br/>Each  ring  includes  with  in  its  own  nature  all  the  rings  within  itself  and  is  included  within  the  natures  of  all  the  rings <br/>outside  of  itself  Thus,  A  i~the  primitive  dot&#x2014;controls  and  contains  the  thirty-nine  rings  which  it  encloses,  all  of  these <br/>partaking  of  its  nature  in  varying  degrees  according  to  their  respective  dignities.  Consequently,  the  entire  area  from  A 1  to <br/>D  10  inclusive  is  the  original  dot,  and  the  rings  symbolize  the  divisions  which  took  place  with  in  it  and  the  emanations <br/>which  poured  out  fi-om  it  after  its  establishment  in  the  midst  of  the  abstract  nature  of  AIN  SOPH.  The  powers  of  the  rings <br/>decrease  towards  the  center  of  the  diagram,  for  Power  is  measured  by  the  number  of  things  controlled,  and  each  ring <br/>controls  the  rings  within  it  and  is  controlled  by  the  rings  outside  of  it.  Thus,  while  A 1  controls  thirty-nine  rings  besides <br/>itself,  B  1  controls  only  twenty-nine  rings  besides  its  own.  Therefore,  A 1  is  more  powerful  than  B  1.  As  the  greatest <br/>spiritual  solidity,  or  permanence,  is  at  the  circumference  and  the  greatest  material  density,  or  impermanence,  is  at  the <br/>center  of  the  diagram,  the  rings  as  they  decrease  in  Power  become  more  material  and  substantial  until  the  center  sphere, <br/>D 10,  symbolizes  the  actual  chemical  elements  of  the  earth.  The  rates  of  vibration  are  also  lower  as  the  rings  approach  the <br/>center.  Thus,  the  vibration  of  A  2  is  lower  than  A 1  but  higher  than  A  3,  and  so  on  in  decreasing  scale  towards  the  center,  A <br/>1  being  the  highest  and  D  10  the  lowest  sphere  of  creation.  While  A 1,  the  ruler  of  creation,  controls  the  circles  marked  A,  B, <br/>C,  and  D,  it  is  less  than  the  three  rings  of  AIN  SOPH~X  1,  X2,  and  X3~and  therefore  bows  before  the  throne  of  the <br/>ineffable  Creator  from  whose  substances  it  was  individualized. <br/><br/>p.  120 <br/><br/>also  ten  Archdemons,  corresponding  to  the  ten  Archangels  of  Briah.  The  black  magicians  use  these <br/>inverted  spirits  in  their  efforts  to  attain  their  nefarious  ends,  but  in  time  the  demon  destroys  those <br/>who  bind  themselves  to  it.  The  ten  orders  of  demons  and  the  ten  Archdemons  of  the  World  of  Assiah <br/>are  as  follows: <br/><br/>D  1,  the  evil  Crown;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Thaumiel,  the  doubles  of  God,  the  Two-headed;  the <br/>Archdemons  are  Satan  and  Moloch. <br/><br/>From  D  1  came  D  2,  the  evil  Wisdom;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Chaigidiel,  those  who  obstruct;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Adam  Belial. <br/><br/>From  D  2  came  D  3,  the  evil  Understanding;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Satharial,  the  concealment  of  God, <br/>the  Archdemon  is  Lucifuge. <br/><br/>From  D  3  came  D  4,  the  evil  Merqr;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Gamchicoth,  the  disturber  of  things;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Astaroth. <br/><br/>From  D  4  came  D  5,  the  evil  Severity;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Golab,  incendiarism  and  burning;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Asmodeus. <br/><br/>From  D  5  came  D  6,  the  evil  Beauty;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Togarini,  the  wranglers;  the  Archdemon  is <br/>Belphegor. <br/><br/>From  D  6  came  D  7,  the  evil  Victory;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Harab  Serap,  the  dispensing  Raven;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Baal  Chanan. <br/><br/>From  D  7  came  D  8,  the  evil  Glory;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Samael,  the  embroiler;  the  Archdemon  is <br/>Adramelek. <br/><br/><br/>From  D  8  came  D  9,  the  evil  Foundation;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Gamaliel,  the  obscene;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Lilith. <br/><br/>From  D  9  came  D  10,  the  evil  Kingdom;  the  hierarchy  is  called  Nahemoth,  the  impure;  the <br/>Archdemon  is  Nahema. <br/><br/>The  Qabbalists  declare  that  the  worlds,  intelligences,  and  hierarchies  were  established  according  to <br/>the  vision  of  Ezekiel.  By  the  man  of  Ezekiel's  vision  is  symbolized  the  World  of  Atziluth;  by  the  throne, <br/>the  World  of  Briah;  by  the  firmament,  the  World  of  Yetzirah;  and  by  the  living  creatures  the  World  of <br/>Assiah.  These  spheres  are  the  wheels  within  wheels  of  the  prophet.  The  Qabbalists  next  established  a <br/>human  figure  in  each  of  the  four  worlds:  A 1  was  the  head  and  A 10  the  feet  of  the  man  oi  Atziluth;  B  1 <br/>was  the  head  and  B  10  the  feet  of  the  man  of  Briah;  C  1  was  the  head  and  C  10  the  feet  of  the  man  of <br/>Yetzirah;  D  1  was  the  head  and  D  10  the  feet  of  the  man  oi  Assiah.  These  four  are  called  the  World <br/>Men.  They  are  considered  androgynous  and  are  the  prototypes  of  humanity. <br/><br/>The  human  body,  like  that  of  the  universe,  is  considered  to  be  a  material  expression  of  ten  globes  or <br/>spheres  of  light.  Therefore  man  is  called  the  Microcosm&#x2014;the  little  world,  built  in  the  image  of  the <br/>great  world  of  which  he  is  a  part.  The  Qabbalists  also  established  a  mysterious  universal  man  with  his <br/>head  at  A 1  and  his  feet  at  D  10.  This  is  probably  the  secret  significance  of  the  great  figure  of <br/>Nebuchadnezzar's  dream,  with  its  head  in  the  World  oi  Atziluth,  its  arms  and  hands  in  the  World  of <br/>Briah,  its  generative  system  in  the  World  of  Yetzirah,  and  its  legs  and  feet  in  the  World  oi  Assiah. <br/>This  is  the  Grand  Man  of  the  Zohar,  of  whom  Eliphas  Levi  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;It  is  not  less  astonishing  to  observe  at  the  beginning  of  the  Zohar  the  profundity  of  its  notions  and <br/>the  sublime  simplicity  of  its  images.  It  is  said  as  follows:  'The  science  of  equilibrium  is  the  key  of <br/>occult  science.  Unbalanced  forces  perish  in  the  void.  So  passed  the  kings  of  the  elder  world,  the <br/>princes  of  the  giants.  They  have  fallen  like  trees  without  roots,  and  their  place  is  found  no  more. <br/>Through  the  conflict  of  unbalanced  forces,  the  devastated  earth  was  void  and  formless,  until  the  Spirit <br/>of  God  made  for  itself  a  place  in  heaven  and  reduced  the  mass  of  waters.  All  the  aspirations  of  Nature <br/>were  directed  then  towards  unity  of  form,  towards  the  living  synthesis  (if  equilibrated  forces;  the  face <br/>of  God,  crowned  with  light,  rose  over  the  vast  sea  and  was  reflected  in  the  waters  thereof.  His  two  eyes <br/>were  manifested,  radiating  with  splendour,  darting  two  beams  of  light  which  crossed  with  those  of  the <br/>reflection.  The  brow  of  God  and  His  eyes  formed  a  triangle  in  heaven,  and  its  reflection  formed  a <br/>second  triangle  in  the  waters.  So  was  revealed  the  number  six,  being  that  of  universal  creation.'  The <br/>text,  which  would  be  unintelligible  in  a  literal  version,  is  translated  here  by  way  of  interpretation.  The <br/>author  makes  it  plain  that  the  human  form  which  he  ascribes  to  Deity  is  only  an  image  of  his  meaning <br/>and  that  God  is  beyond  expression  by  human  thought  or  representation  by  any  figure.  Pascal  said  that <br/>God  is  a  circle,  of  which  the  center  is  everywhere  and  the  circumference  nowhere.  But  how  is  one  to <br/>imagine  a  circle  apart  from  its  circumference?  The  Zohar  adopts  the  antithesis  of  this  paradoxical <br/>image  and  in  respect  of  the  circle  of  Pascal  would  say  rather  that  the  circumference  is  everywhere, <br/>while  that  which  is  nowhere  is  the  center.  It  is  however  to  a  balance  and  not  to  a  circle  that  it <br/>compares  the  universal  equilibrium  of  things.  It  affirms  that  equilibrium  is  everywhere  and  so  also  is <br/>the  central  point  where  the  balance  hangs  in  suspension.  We  find  that  the  Zohar  is  thus  more  forcible <br/>and  more  profound  than  Pascal.  *  *  *  The  Zohar  is  a  genesis  of  light;  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  is  a  ladder  of <br/>truth.  Therein  are  expounded  the  two-and-thirty  absolute  symbols  of  speech&#x2014;being  numbers  and <br/>letters.  Each  letter  produces  a  number,  an  idea  and  a  form,  so  that  mathematics  are  applicable  to <br/>forms  and  ideas,  even  as  to  numbers,  in  virtue  of  an  exact  proportion,  and  a  perfect  correspondence. <br/>By  the  science  of  the  Sepher  Yetzirah,  the  human  mind  is  rooted  in  truth  and  in  reason;  it  accounts <br/>for  all  progress  possible  to  intelligence  by  means  of  the  evolution  of  numbers.  Thus  does  the  Zohar <br/>represent  absolute  truth,  while  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  furnishes  the  method  of  its  acquisition,  its <br/>discernment  and  application.&quot;  {History  of  Magic.) <br/><br/><br/>By  placing  man  himself  at  the  point  D  lo,  his  true  constitution  is  revealed.  He  exists  upon  four  worlds, <br/>only  one  of  which  is  visible.  It  is  then  made  evident  that  his  parts  and  members  upon  the  material <br/>plane  are,  by  analogy,  hierarchies  and  intelligences  in  the  higher  worlds.  Here,  again,  the  law  of <br/>interpenetration  is  evidenced.  Although  within  man  is  the  entire  universe  (the  43  spheres <br/>interpenetrating  D  10),  he  is  ignorant  of  its  existence  because  he  cannot  exercise  control  over  that <br/>which  is  superior  to  or  greater  than  himself.  Nevertheless,  all  these  higher  spheres  exercise  control <br/>over  him,  as  his  functions  and  activities  demonstrate.  If  they  did  not,  he  would  be  an  inert  mass  of <br/>substance.  Death  is  merely  the  result  of  deflecting  the  life  impulses  of  the  higher  rings  away  from  the <br/>lower  body. <br/><br/>The  control  of  the  transubstantial  rings  over  their  own  material  reflection  is  called  life,  and  the  spirit <br/>of  man  is,  in  reality,  a  name  given  to  this  great  host  of  intelligences,  which  are  focused  upon <br/>substance  through  a  point  called  the  ego,  established  in  the  midst  of  themselves.  X 1  is  the  outside <br/>boundary  of  the  human  Auric  Egg,  and  the  entire  diagram  becomes  a  cross  section  of  the  constitution <br/>of  man,  or  a  cross  section  of  the  Kosmic  constitution,  if  correlated  with  the  universe.  By  the  secret <br/>culture  of  the  Qabbalistic  School,  man  is  taught  how  to  climb  the  rings  (unfold  his  consciousness) <br/>until  at  last  he  returns  to  AIN  SOPH.  The  process  by  which  this  is  accomplished  is  called  the  Fifly <br/>Gates  of  Light.  Kircher,  the  Jesuit  Qabbalist,  declares  that  Moses  passed  through  forty-nine  of  the <br/>gates,  but  that  Christ  alone  passed  the  fiftieth  gate. <br/><br/>To  the  third  edition  of  the  Sepher  Yetzirah  translated  from  the  Hebrew  by  Wm.  Wynn  Westcott  are <br/>appended  the  Fifty  Gates  of  Intelligence  emanating  from  Binah,  the  second  Sephira.  The  source  of <br/>this  information  is  Kircher's  CEdipus  ^gyptiacus.  The  gates  are  divided  into  six  orders,  of  which  the <br/>first  four  have  each  ten  subdivisions,  the  fifth  nine,  and  the  sixth  only  one. <br/><br/>The  first  order  of  gates  is  termed  Elementary  and  its  divisions  areas  follows:  (1)  Chaos,  Hyle,  the  First <br/><br/>Matter;  (2)  Formless,  void,  lifeless;  (3)  The  Abyss;  (4)  Origin  of  the  Elements;  (5)  Earth  (no  seed <br/>germs);  (6)  Water;(7)  Air;(8)  Fire;(9)  Differentiation  of  qualities;  (10)  Mixture  and  combination. <br/><br/>The  second  order  of  gates  is  termed  Decad  of  Evolution  and  its  divisions  areas  follows:  (11)  Minerals <br/>differentiate;  (12)  Vegetable  principles  appear;  (13)  Seeds  germinate  in  moisture;  (14)  Herbs  and <br/>Trees;  (15)  Fructification  in  vegetable  life;  (16)  Origin  of  low  forms  of  animal  life;  (17)  Insects  and <br/>Reptiles  appear;  (18)  Fishes,  vertebrate  life  in  the  waters;  (19)  Birds,  vertebrate  life  in  the  air;  (20) <br/>Quadrupeds,  vertebrate  earth  animals. <br/><br/>The  third  order  of  gates  is  termed  Decad  of  Humanity  and  its  divisions  are  as  follows:  (21) <br/>Appearance  of  Man;  (22)  Material  human  body;  (23)  Human  Soul  conferred;  (24)  Mystery  of  Adam <br/>and  Eve;  (25)  Complete  Man  as  the  Microcosm;  (26)  Gift  of  five  human  faces  acting  exteriorly;  (27) <br/>Gift  of  five  powers  to  the  soul;  (28)  Adam  Kadmon,  the  Heavenly  Man;  (29)  Angelic  beings,  (30)  Man <br/>in  the  image  of  God. <br/><br/>The  fourth  order  of  gates  is  termed  World  of  Spheres  and  its  divisions  are  as  follows:  (31)  The  Heaven <br/>of  the  Moon;  (32)  The  Heaven  of  Mercury,  (33)  The  Heaven  of  Venus;  (34)  The  Heaven  of  the  Sun; <br/>(35)  The  Heaven  of  Mars;  (36)  The  Heaven  of  Jupiter;  (37)  The  Heaven  of  Saturn;  (38)  The <br/>Firmament;  (39)  The  Primum  Mobile;  (40)  The  Empyrean  Heaven. <br/><br/>The  fifth  order  of  gates  is  termed  The  Angelic  World  and  its  divisions  are  as  follows:  (41)  Ishim&#x2014;Sons <br/>of  Fire;  (42)  Orphanim&#x2014;Cherubim;  (43)  Aralim&#x2014;Thrones;  (44)  Chashmalim&#x2014;Dominions;  (45) <br/>Seraphim&#x2014;Virtues;  (46)  Melachim&#x2014;Powers;  (47)  Elohim&#x2014;Principalities;  (48)  Ben  Elohim&#x2014;Angels; <br/>(49)  Cherubim&#x2014;Archangels.  [The  order  of  the  Angels  is  a  matter  of  controversy,  the  arrangement <br/>above  differing  from  that  accepted  in  other  sections  of  this  volume.  The  Rabbins  disagree <br/>fundamentally  as  to  the  proper  sequence  of  the  Angelic  names.] <br/><br/><br/>The  sixth  order  is  termed  The  Archetype  and  consists  of  but  one  gate:  (50)  God,  AIN  SOPH,  He <br/>whom  no  mortal  eye  hath  seen.  The  fiftieth  gate  leads  from  creation  into  the  Creative  Principle  and  he <br/>who  passes  through  it  returns  into  the  unlimited  and  undifferentiated  condition  of  ALL.  The  fifty <br/>gates  reveal  a  certain  evolutionary  process  and  it  was  declared  by  the  Rabbins  that  he  who  would <br/>attain  to  the  highest  degree  of  understanding  must  pass  sequentially  through  all  of  these  orders  of  life, <br/>each  of  which  constituted  a  gate  in  that  the  spirit,  passing  from  the  lower  to  the  higher,  found  in  each <br/>more  responsive  organism  new  avenues  of  self-expression. <br/><br/><br/>p.  121 <br/><br/><br/>The  Tree  of  the  Sephiroth <br/><br/>THE  Tree  of  the  Sephiroth  may  be  considered  an  invaluable  compendium  of  the  secret  philosophy <br/>which  originally  was  the  spirit  and  soul  of  Chasidism.  The  Qabbalah  is  the  priceless  heritage  of  Israel, <br/>but  each  year  those  who  comprehend  its  true  principles  become  fewer  in  number.  The  Jew  of  today,  if <br/>he  lacks  a  realization  of  the  profundity  of  his  people's  doctrines,  is  usually  permeated  with  that  most <br/>dangerous  form  of  ignorance,  modernism,  and  is  prone  to  regard  the  Qabbalah  either  as  an  evil  to  be <br/>shunned  like  the  plague  or  as  a  ridiculous  superstition  which  has  survived  the  black  magic  of  the  Dark <br/>Ages.  Yet  without  the  key  which  the  Qabbalah  supplies,  the  spiritual  mysteries  of  both  the  Old  and  the <br/>New  Testament  must  remain  unsolved  by  Jew  and  Gentile  alike. <br/><br/>The  Sephirothic  Tree  consists  of  ten  globes  of  luminous  splendor  arranged  in  three  vertical  columns <br/>and  connected  by  22  channels  or  paths.  The  ten  globes  are  called  the  Sephiroth  and  to  them  are <br/>assigned  the  numbers  i  to  10.  The  three  columns  are  called  Mercy  (on  the  right).  Severity  (on  the  left), <br/>and,  between  them,  Mildness,  as  the  reconciling  power.  The  columns  may  also  be  said  to  represent <br/>Wisdom,  Strength,  and  Beauty,  which  form  the  triune  support  of  the  universe,  for  it  is  written  that <br/>the  foundation  of  all  things  is  the  Three.  The  22  channels  are  the  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet  and <br/>to  them  are  assigned  the  major  trumps  of  the  Tarot  deck  of  symbolic  cards. <br/><br/>Eliphas  Levi  declared  that  by  arranging  the  Tarot  cards  according  to  a  definite  order  man  could <br/>discover  all  that  is  knowable  concerning  his  God,  his  universe,  and  himself.  When  the  ten  numbers <br/>which  pertain  to  the  globes  (Sephiroth)  are  combined  with  the  22  letters  relating  to  the  channels,  the <br/>resultant  sum  is  32~the  number  peculiar  to  the  Qabbalistic  Paths  of  Wisdom.  These  Paths, <br/>occasionally  referred  to  as  the  32  teeth  in  the  mouth  of  the  Vast  Countenance  or  as  the  32  nerves  that <br/>branch  out  from  the  Divine  Brain,  are  analogous  to  the  first  32  degrees  of  Freemasonry,  which  elevate <br/>the  candidate  to  the  dignity  of  a  Prince  of  the  Royal  Secret.  Qabbalists  also  consider  it  extremely <br/>significant  that  in  the  original  Hebrew  Scriptures  the  name  of  God  should  occur  32  times  in  the  first <br/>chapter  of  Genesis.  (In  the  English  translations  of  the  Bible  the  name  appears  33  times.)  In  the  mystic <br/>analysis  of  the  human  body,  according  to  the  Rabbins,  32  spinal  segments  lead  upward  to  the  Temple <br/>of  Wisdom&#x2014;the  skull. <br/><br/>The  four  Qabbalistic  Trees  described  in  the  preceding  chapter  were  combined  by  later  Jewish  scholars <br/>into  one  all-inclusive  diagram  and  termed  by  them  not  only  the  Sephirothic  but  also  the  Archetypal, <br/>or  Heavenly,  Adam.  According  to  some  authorities,  it  is  this  Heavenly  Adam,  and  not  a  terrestrial <br/>man,  whose  creation  is  described  in  the  opening  chapters  of  Genesis.  Out  of  the  substances  of  this <br/>divine  man  the  universe  was  formed;  in  him  it  remains  and  will  continue  even  after  dissolution  shall <br/>resolve  the  spheres  back  into  their  own  primitive  substance.  The  Deity  is  never  conceived  of  as <br/>actually  contained  in  the  Sephiroth,  which  are  purely  hypothetical  vessels  employed  to  define  the <br/>limits  of  the  Creative  Essence.  Adolph  Franck  rather  likens  the  Sephiroth  to  varicolored  transparent <br/>glass  bowls  filled  with  pure  light,  which  apparently  assumes  the  color  of  its  containers  but  whose <br/>essential  nature  remains  ever  unchanged  and  unchangeable. <br/><br/>The  ten  Sephiroth  composing  the  body  of  the  prototypic  Adam,  the  numbers  related  to  them,  and  the <br/>parts  of  the  universe  to  which  they  correspond  are  as  follows: <br/><br/><br/>No. <br/><br/>THE  SEPHIROTH <br/><br/>THE  UNIVERSE <br/><br/>ALTERNATIVE  ! <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>Kether~the  Crown <br/><br/>Primum  Mobile <br/><br/>The  Fiery  Heavens  j <br/><br/>2 <br/><br/>Chochmah&#x2014;Wisdom <br/><br/>The  Zodiac <br/><br/>The  First  Motion <br/><br/>3 <br/><br/>Binah&#x2014;Understanding <br/><br/>Saturn <br/><br/>The  Zodiac <br/><br/>4 <br/><br/>Chesed&#x2014;Mercy <br/><br/>Jupiter <br/><br/>Saturn <br/><br/>5 <br/><br/>Geburah&#x2014;Severity <br/><br/>Mars <br/><br/>Jupiter  J <br/><br/>6 <br/><br/>Tiphereth&#x2014;Beauty <br/><br/>Sun <br/><br/>Mars  J <br/><br/>7 <br/><br/>Netsah&#x2014;Victory <br/><br/>Venus <br/><br/>Sun <br/><br/>8 <br/><br/>Hod&#x2014;Glory <br/><br/>Mercury <br/><br/>Venus <br/><br/>9 <br/><br/>Jesod~the  Foundation <br/><br/>Moon <br/><br/>Mercury <br/><br/>10 <br/><br/>Malchuth~the  Kingdom <br/><br/>Elements <br/><br/>Moon <br/><br/>It  must  continually  be  emphasized  that  the  Sephiroth  and  the  properties  assigned  to  them,  like  the <br/>tetractys  of  the  Pythagoreans,  are  merely  symbols  of  the  cosmic  system  with  its  multitude  of  parts. <br/>The  truer  and  fuller  meaning  of  these  emblems  may  not  be  revealed  by  writing  or  by  word  of  mouth, <br/>but  must  be  divined  as  the  result  of  study  and  meditation.  In  the  Sepher  ha  Zohar  it  is  written  that <br/>there  is  a  garment&#x2014; the  written  doctrine-which  every  man  may  see.  Those  with  understanding  do  not <br/>look  upon  the  garment  but  at  the  body  beneath  it &#x2014;the  intellectual  and  philosophical  code.  The  wisest <br/>of  all,  however,  the  servants  of  the  Heavenly  King,  look  at  nothing  save  the  soul&#x2014;the  spiritual <br/>doctrine&#x2014; which  is  the  eternal  and  ever-springing  root  of  the  law.  Of  this  great  truth  Eliphas  Levi  also <br/>writes  declaring  that  none  can  gain  entrance  to  the  secret  House  of  Wisdom  unless  he  wear  the <br/>voluminous  cape  of  Apollonius  of  Tyana  and  carry  in  his  hand  the  lamp  of  Hermes.  The  cape  signifies <br/>the  qualities  of  self-possession  and  self-reliance  which  must  envelope  the  seeker  as  a  cloak  of  strength, <br/>while  the  ever-burning  lamp  of  the  sage  represents  the  illumined  mind  and  perfectly  balanced <br/>intellect  without  which  the  mystery  of  the  ages  can  never  be  solved. <br/><br/>The  Sephirothic  Tree  is  sometimes  depicted  as  a  human  body,  thus  more  definitely  establishing  the <br/>true  identity  of  the  first,  or  Heavenly,  Man&#x2014; Adam  Kadmon&#x2014; the  Idea  of  the  Universe.  The  ten  divine <br/>globes  (Sephiroth)  are  then  considered  as  analogous  to  the  ten  sacred  members  and  organs  of  the <br/>Protogonos,  according  to  the  following  arrangement.  Kether  is  the  crown  of  the  Prototypic  Head  and <br/>perhaps  refers  to  the  pineal  gland;  Chochmah  and  Binah  are  the  right  and  left  hemispheres <br/>respectively  of  the  Great  Brain;  Chesed  and  Geburah  (Pechad)  are  the  right  and  left  arms  respectively, <br/>signifying  the  active  creative  members  of  the  Grand  Man;  Tiphereth  is  the  heart,  or,  according  to <br/>some,  the  entire  viscera;  Netsah  and  Hod  are  the  right  and  left  legs  respectively,  or  the  supports  of  the <br/>world;  Jesod  is  the  generative  system,  or  the  foundation  of  form;  and  Malchuth  represents  the  two <br/>feet,  or  the  base  of  being.  Occasionally  Jesod  is  considered  as  the  male  and  Malchuth  as  the  female <br/>generative  power.  The  Grand  Man  thus  conceived  is  the  gigantic  image  of  Nebuchadnezzar's  dream, <br/>with  head  of  gold,  arms  and  chest  of  silver,  body  of  brass,  legs  of  iron,  and  feet  of  clay.  The  mediaeval <br/>Qabbalists  also  assigned  one  of  the  Ten  Commandments  and  a  tenth  part  of  the  Lord's  Prayer  in <br/>sequential  order  to  each  of  the  ten  Sephiroth. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  emanations  from  Kether  which  establish  themselves  as  three  triads  of  Creative <br/>Powers&#x2014; termed  in  the  Sepher  ha  Zohar  three  heads  each  with  three  faces&#x2014; H.  P.  Blavatsky  writes: <br/>&quot;This  [Kether]  was  the  first  Sephiroth,  containing  in  herself  the  other  nine  mi'so  Sephiroth,  or <br/>intelligences.  In  their  totality  and  unity  they  represent  the  archetypal  man,  Adam  Kadmon,  the <br/>jiptoTOYOVo?,  who  in  his  individuality  or  unity  is  yet  dual,  or  bisexual,  the  Greek  Didumos,  for  he  is  the <br/>prototype  of  all  humanity.  Thus  we  obtain  three  trinities,  each  contained  in  a  'head.'  In  the  first  head, <br/>or  face  (the  three-faced  Hindu  Trimurti), <br/><br/><br/>o <br/><br/>THE  FOUR  SEPHIROTHIC  TREES. <br/><br/><br/>The  forty  concentric  circles  shown  in  the  large  circular  cut  in  the  preceding  chapter  are  here  arranged  as  four  trees,  each <br/>consisting  of  ten  circles.  These  trees  disclose  the  organization  of  the  hierarchies  controlling  the  destinies  of  all  creation. <br/>The  trees  are  the  same  in  each  of  the  four  world  but  the  powers  vested  in  the  globes  express  themselves  differently <br/>through  the  substances  of  each  world,  resulting  in  endless  differentiation. <br/><br/>p.  123 <br/><br/>we  find  Sephira  [Kether],  the  first  androgyne,  at  the  apex  of  the  upper  triangle,  emitting  Hachama <br/>[Chochmah],  or  Wisdom,  a  mascuHne  and  active  potency&#x2014;also  called  Jah,  n'-'-and  Binah,  nrn,  or <br/>Intelligence,  a  female  and  passive  potency,  also  represented  by  the  name  Jehovah  mn\  These  three <br/>form  the  first  trinity  or  'face'  of  the  Sephiroth.  This  triad  emanated  Hesed,  ion,  or  Mercy,  a  masculine <br/>active  potency,  also  called  El,  from  which  emanated  Geburah  nn3:i,  or  justice,  also  called  Eloha,  a <br/>feminine  passive  potency;  from  the  union  of  these  two  was  produced  Tiphereth  mxsD,  Beauty, <br/>Clemency,  the  Spiritual  Sun,  known  by  the  divine  name  Elohim;  and  the  second  triad,  'face,'  or  'head,' <br/>was  formed.  These  emanating,  in  their  turn,  the  masculine  potency  Netzah,  niJ],  Firmness,  or  Jehovah <br/>Sabaoth,  who  issued  the  feminine  passive  potency  Hod,7in,  Splendor,  or  Elohim  Sabaoth;  the  two <br/>produced  Jesod,  &quot;no&quot;'.  Foundation,  who  is  the  mighty  living  one  El-Chai,  thus  yielding  the  third  trinity <br/>or  'head.'  The  tenth  Sephiroth  is  rather  a  duad,  and  is  represented  on  the  diagrams  as  the  lowest  circle. <br/>It  is  Malchuth  or  Kingdom,  niD'^a,  and  Shekinah,  nv'D^,  also  called  Adonai,  and  Cherubim  among  the <br/>angelic  hosts.  The  first  'Head'  is  called  the  Intellectual  world;  the  second  'Head'  is  the  Sensuous,  or <br/>the  world  of  Perception,  and  the  third  is  the  material  or  Physical  world.&quot;  (See  Isis  Unveiled.) <br/><br/>Among  the  later  Qabbalists  there  is  also  a  division  of  the  Sephirothic  Tree  into  five  parts,  in  which  the <br/>distribution  of  the  globes  is  according  to  the  following  order: <br/><br/>(1)  Macroprosophus,  or  the  Great  Face,  is  the  term  applied  to  Kether  as  the  first  and  most  exalted  of <br/>the  Sephiroth  and  includes  the  nine  potencies  or  Sephiroth  issuing  from  Kether. <br/><br/>(2)  Abba,  the  Great  Father,  is  the  term  generally  applied  to  Chochmah&#x2014;Universal  Wisdom&#x2014;the  first <br/>emanation  of  Kether,  but,  according  to  Ibn  Gebirol,  Chochmah  represents  the  Son,  the  Logos  or  the <br/>Word  born  from  the  union  of  Kether  and  Binah. <br/><br/>(3)  Aima,  the  Great  Mother,  is  the  name  by  which  Binah,  or  the  third  Sephira,  is  generally  known. <br/>This  is  the  Holy  Ghost,  from  whose  body  the  generations  issue  forth.  Being  the  third  person  of  the <br/>Creative  Triad,  it  corresponds  to  Jehovah,  the  Demiurgus. <br/><br/>(4)  Microprosophus,  or  the  Lesser  Face,  is  composed  of  the  six  Sephiroth&#x2014; Chesed,  Geburah, <br/>Tiphereth,  Netsah,  Hod,  and  Jesod.  The  Microprosophus  is  commonly  called  the  Lesser  Adam,  or <br/>Zauir  Anpin,  whereas  the  Macroprosophus,  or  Superior  Adam,  is  Arikh  Anpin.  The  Lesser  Face  is <br/>properly  symbolized  by  the  six-pointed  star  or  interlaced  triangles  of  Zion  and  also  by  the  six  faces  of <br/>the  cube.  It  represents  the  directions  north,  east,  south,  west,  up,  and  down,  and  also  the  first  six  days <br/>of  Creation.  In  his  list  of  the  parts  of  the  Microprosophus,  MacGregor-Mathers  includes  Binah  as  the <br/>first  and  superior  part  of  the  Lesser  Adam,  thus  making  his  constitution  septenary.  If <br/>Microprosophus  be  considered  as  sexpartite,  then  his  globes  (Sephiroth)  are  analogous  to  the  six  days <br/>of  Creation,  and  the  tenth  globe,  Malchuth,  to  the  Sabbath  of  rest. <br/><br/>(5)  The  Bride  of  Microprosophus  is  Malchuth&#x2014; the  epitome  of  the  Sephiroth,  its  quaternary <br/>constitution  being  composed  of  blendings  of  the  four  elements.  This  is  the  divine  Eve  that  is  taken  out <br/><br/><br/>A  TABLE  OF  SEPHIROTHIC  CORRESPONDENCES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  Collectio  Operum. <br/><br/>The  above  diagram  has  been  specially  translated  from  the  Latin  as  being  of  unique  value  to  students  of  Qabbalism  and <br/>also  as  an  example  of  Robert  Fludd's  unusual  ability  in  assembling  tables  of  correspondences.  Robert  Fludd  ranks  among <br/>the  most  eminent  Rosicrucians  and  Freemasons;  in  fact,  he  has  often  been  called  &quot;the  first  English  Rosicrucian.&quot;  He  has <br/>written  several  valuable  documents  directly  bearing  upon  the  Rosicrucian  enigma.  It  is  significant  that  the  most  important <br/>of  his  works  should  be  published  at  the  same  time  as  those  of  Bacon,  Shakespeare,  and  the  first  Rosicrucian  authors. <br/><br/><br/>p.  123 <br/><br/><br/>ftlFREiSEtnWrtaN:  CjoNTATNLNtS  THE  fltfM  TOTTAL  OF  THE  CABALA  FCS(  WSERPPH <br/><br/><br/>HORIZON  OF <br/><br/><br/>ETERNITY <br/><br/><br/>HI^Mt  Crown <br/><br/><br/>SEPHlROrrHIC  SYSTHkl <br/><br/><br/>OF  TEN  DIVINENAMES <br/><br/><br/>5t:pSLirn[3i  II <br/><br/><br/>THE  SEPHIROTHIC  TREE  OF  THE  LATER  QABBALISTS. <br/><br/><br/>Translated  from  Kircher's  (Edipus^gyptiacus. <br/><br/>Having  demonstrated  that  the  Qabbahsts  divided  the  universe  into  four  worlds,  each  consisting  of  ten  spheres,  it  is <br/>necessary  to  consider  next  how  the  ten  spheres  of  each  world  were  arranged  into  what  is  called  the  &quot;Sephirothic  Tree.&quot; <br/>This  Tree  is  composed  of  ten  circles,  representing  the  numbers  i  to  20  and  connected  together  by  twenty-two  canals&#x2014;the <br/>twenty-two  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet.  The  ten  numbers  plus  the  twenty-two  letters  result  in  the  occult  number  32, <br/>which,  according  to  the  Mishna,  signifies  the  Thirty-two  Paths  of  Wisdom.  Letters  and  numbers,  according  to  the <br/>Qabbalists,  are  the  keys  to  all  knowledge,  for  by  a  secret  system  of  arranging  them  the  mysteries  of  creation  are  revealed. <br/>For  this  reason  they  are  called  &quot;the  Paths  of  Wisdom.&quot;  This  occult  fact  is  carefully  concealed  in  the  32nd  degree  of <br/>Freemasonry. <br/><br/>There  are  four  trees,  one  in  each  of  the  four  worlds  established  in  the  preceding  chapter.  The  first  is  in  the  Atziluthic <br/>World,  the  ten  circles  being  the  ten  globes  of  light  established  in  the  midst  of  AIN  SOPH.  The  powers  and  attributes  of  this <br/>Tree  are  reflected  into  each  of  the  three  lower  worlds,  the  form  of  the  Tree  remaining  the  same  but  its  power  diminishing <br/>as  it  descends.  To  further  complicate  their  doctrine,  the  Qabbalists  created  another  tree,  which  was  a  composite  of  all  four <br/><br/><br/>of  the  world  trees  but  consisted  of  only  ten  globes.  In  this  single  tree  were  condensed  all  the  arcana  previously  scattered <br/>through  the  voluminous  archives  of  Qabbalistic  literature. <br/><br/>p.  124 <br/><br/>of  the  side  of  Microprosophus  and  combines  the  potencies  of  the  entire  Qabbahstic  Tree  in  one <br/>sphere,  which  may  be  termed  man. <br/><br/>According  to  the  mysteries  of  the  Sephiroth,  the  order  of  the  Creation,  or  the  Divine  Lightning  Flash <br/>which  zigzags  through  the  four  worlds  according  to  the  order  of  the  divine  emanations,  is  thus <br/>described:  From  AIN  SOPH,  the  Nothing  and  All,  the  Eternal  and  Unconditioned  Potency,  issues <br/>Macroprosophus,  the  Long  Face,  of  whom  it  is  written,  &quot;Within  His  skull  exist  daily  thirteen <br/>thousand  myriads  of  worlds  which  draw  their  existence  from  Him  and  by  Him  are  upheld.&quot;  (See  The <br/>Greater  Holy  Assembly.)  Macroprosophus,  the  directionalized  will  of  AIN  SOPH,  corresponding  to <br/>Kether,  the  Crown  of  the  Sephiroth,  gives  birth  out  of  Himself  to  the  nine  lesser  spheres  of  which  He <br/>is  the  sum  and  the  overbrooding  cause.  The  22  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet,  by  the  various <br/>combinations  of  which  the  laws  of  the  universe  are  established,  constitute  the  scepter  of <br/>Macroprosophus  which  He  wields  from  His  flaming  throne  in  the  Atziluthic  World. <br/><br/>From  this  eternal  and  ancient  androgyne~Kether~come  forth  Chochmah,  the  great  Father,  and <br/>Binah,  the  great  Mother.  These  two  are  usually  referred  to  as  Abba  and  Aima  respectively&#x2014;the  first <br/>male  and  the  first  female,  the  prototypes  of  sex.  These  correspond  to  the  first  two  letters  of  the  sacred <br/>name,  Jehovah,  mn%  IHVH.  The  Father  is  the  %  or  /,  and  the  Mother  is  the  n,  or  H.  Abba  and  Aima <br/>symbolize  the  creative  activities  of  the  universe,  and  are  established  in  the  creative  world  of  Briah.  In <br/>the  Sepher  ha  Zohar  it  is  written,  &quot;And  therefore  are  all  things  established  in  the  equality  of  male  and <br/>female;  for  were  it  not  so,  how  could  they  subsist?  This  beginning  is  the  Father  of  all  things;  the <br/>Father  of  all  Fathers;  and  both  are  mutually  bound  together,  and  the  one  path  shineth  into  the  other&#x2014; <br/>Chochmah,  Wisdom,  as  the  Father;  Binah,  Understanding,  as  the  Mother.&quot; <br/><br/>There  is  a  difference  of  opinion  concerning  certain  of  the  relationships  of  the  parts  of  the  first  triad. <br/>Some  Qabbalists,  including  Ibn  Gebirol,  consider  Kether  as  the  Father,  Binah  as  the  Mother,  and <br/>Chochmah  as  the  Son.  In  this  later  arrangement.  Wisdom,  which  is  the  attribute  of  the  Son,  becomes <br/>the  creator  of  the  lower  spheres.  The  symbol  of  Binah  is  the  dove,  a  proper  emblem  for  the  brooding <br/>maternal  instinct  of  the  Universal  Mother. <br/><br/>Because  of  the  close  similarity  of  their  creative  triad  to  the  Christian  Trinity,  the  later  Qabbalists <br/>rearranged  the  first  three  Sephiroth  and  added  a  mysterious  point  called  Daath&#x2014;a  hypothetical <br/>eleventh  Sephira.  This  is  located  where  the  horizontal  line  connecting  Chochmah  and  Binah  crosses <br/>the  vertical  line  joining  Kether  and  Tiphereth.  While  Daath  is  not  mentioned  by  the  first  Qabbalists,  it <br/>is  a  highly  important  element  and  its  addition  to  the  Sephirothic  Tree  was  not  made  without  full <br/>realization  of  the  significance  of  such  action.  If  Chochmah  be  considered  the  active,  intelligent  energy <br/>of  Kether,  and  Binah  the  receptive  capacity  of  Kether,  then  Daath  becomes  the  thought  which, <br/>created  by  Chochmah,  flows  into  Binah.  The  postulation  of  Daath  clarifies  the  problem  of  the  Creative <br/>Trinity,  for  here  it  is  diagrammatically  represented  as  consisting  of  Chochmah  (the  Father),  Binah <br/>(the  Mother,  or  Holy  Ghost),  and  Daath,  the  Word  by  which  the  worlds  were  established.  Isaac  Myer <br/>discounts  the  importance  of  Daath,  declaring  it  a  subterfuge  to  conceal  the  fact  that  Kether,  and  not <br/>Chochmah;  is  the  true  Father  of  the  Creative  Triad.  He  makes  no  attempt  to  give  a  satisfactory <br/>explanation  for  the  symbolism  of  this  hypothetical  Sephira. <br/><br/>According  to  the  original  conception,  from  the  union  of  the  Divine  Father  and  the  Divine  Mother  is <br/>produced  Microprosophus&#x2014; the  Short  Face  or  the  Lesser  Countenance,  which  is  established  in  the <br/>Yetziratic  World  of  formation  and  corresponds  to  the  letter  i,  or  V,  in  the  Great  Name.  The  six  powers <br/>of  Microprosophus  flow  from  and  are  contained  in  their  own  source,  which  is  Binah,  the  Mother  of <br/><br/><br/>the  Lesser  Adam.  These  constitute  the  spheres  of  the  sacred  planets;  their  name  is  Elohim,  and  they <br/><br/>move  upon  the  face  of  the  deep.  The  tenth  Sephira&#x2014;Malchuth,  the  Kingdom&#x2014;is  described  as  the  Bride <br/>of  the  Lesser  Adam,  created  back  to  back  with  her  lord,  and  to  it  is  assigned  the  final,  n,  or  H,  the  last <br/>letter  of  the  Sacred  Name.  The  dwelling  place  of  Malchuth  is  in  the  fourth  world&#x2014; Assiah~and  it  is <br/>composed  of  all  the  superior  powers  reflected  into  the  elements  of  the  terrestrial  sphere.  Thus  it  will <br/>be  seen  that  the  Qabbalistic  Tree  extends  through  four  worlds,  with  its  branches  in  matter  and  its <br/>roots  in  the  Ancient  of  Ancients&#x2014; Macroprosop/ius. <br/><br/>Three  vertical  columns  support  the  universal  system  as  typified  by  the  Sephirothic  Tree.  The  central <br/>pillar  has  its  foundation  in  Kether,  the  Eternal  One.  It  passes  downward  through  the  hypothetical <br/>Sephira,  Daath,  and  then  through  Tiphereth  and  Jesod,  with  its  lower  end  resting  upon  the  firm <br/>foundation  of  Malchuth,  the  last  of  the  globes.  The  true  import  of  the  central  pillar  is  equilibrium.  It <br/>demonstrates  how  the  Deity  always  manifests  by  emanating  poles  of  expression  from  the  midst  of <br/>Itself  but  remaining  free  from  the  illusion  of  polarity.  If  the  numbers  of  the  four  Sephiroth  connected <br/>by  this  column  be  added  together  (i  +6  +9  +  10),  the  sum  is  26,  the  number  of  Jehovah.  (See  chapter <br/>on  Pythagorean  Mathematics.) <br/><br/>The  column  on  the  right,  which  is  called  Jachin,  has  its  foundation  on  Chochmah,  the  outpouring <br/>Wisdom  of  God;  the  three  globes  suspended  from  it  are  all  masculine  potencies.  The  column  at  the <br/>left  is  called  Boaz.  The  three  globes  upon  it  are  feminine  and  receptive  potencies,  for  it  is  founded  in <br/>Understanding,  a  receptive  and  maternal  potency.  Wisdom,  it  will  be  noted,  is  considered  as  radiant <br/>or  outpouring,  and  Understanding  as  receptive,  or  something  which  is  filled  by  the  flowing  of <br/>Wisdom.  The  three  pillars  are  ultimately  united  in  Malchuth,  in  which  all  the  powers  of  the  superior <br/>worlds  are  manifested. <br/><br/>The  four  globes  upon  the  central  column  reveal  the  function  of  the  creative  power  in  the  various <br/>worlds.  In  the  first  world  the  creative  power  is  Will&#x2014; the  one  Divine  Cause;  in  the  second  world,  the <br/>hypothetical  Daath&#x2014; the  Word  coming  forth  from  the  Divine  Thought;  in  the  third  world,  Tiphereth&#x2014; <br/>the  Sun,  or  focal  point  between  God  and  Nature;  in  the  fourth  world  it  is  twofold,  being  the  positive <br/>and  negative  poles  of  the  reproductive  system,  of  which  Jesod  is  the  male  and  Malchuth  the  female. <br/><br/>In  Kircher's  Sephirothic  Tree  it  should  be  especially  noted  that  the  ornaments  of  the  Tabernacle <br/>appear  in  the  various  parts  of  the  diagram.  These  indicate  a  direct  relationship  between  the  sacred <br/>House  of  God  and  the  universe&#x2014;a  relationship  which  must  always  be  considered  as  existing  between <br/>the  Deity  through  whose  activity  the  world  is  produced  and  the  world  itself,  which  must  be  the  house <br/>or  vehicle  of  that  Deity.  Could  the  modern  scientific  world  but  sense  the  true  profundity  of  these <br/>philosophical  deductions  of  the  ancients,  it  would  realize  that  those  who  fabricated  the  structure  of <br/>the  Qabbalah  possessed  a  knowledge  of  the  celestial  plan  comparable  in  every  respect  with  that  of  the <br/>modern  savant. <br/><br/>The  Tetragrammaton,  or  the  four-lettered  Name  of  God,  written  thus  mn%  is  pronounce  Jehovah.  The <br/>first  letter  is  %  Yod,  the  Germ,  the  Life,  the  Flame,  the  Cause,  the  One,  and  the  most  fundamental  of <br/>the  Jewish  phallic  emblems.  Its  numerical  value  is  10,  and  it  is  to  be  considered  as  the  1  containing <br/>the  10.  In  the  Qabbalah  it  is  declared  that  the  a  Yod  is  in  reality  three  Yods,  of  which  the  first  is  the <br/>beginning,  the  second  is  the  center,  and  the  third  is  the  end.  Its  throne  is  the  Sephira  Chochmah <br/>(according  to  Ibn  Gebirol,  Kether),  from  which  it  goes  forth  to  impregnate  Binah,  which  is  the  first  n. <br/>He.  The  result  of  this  union  is  Tiphereth,  which  is  the  1  Van,  whose  power  is  6  and  which  symbolizes <br/>the  six  members  of  the  Lesser  Adam.  The  final  n.  He,  is  Malchuth,  the  Inferior  Mother,  partaking  in <br/>part  of  the  potencies  of  the  Divine  Mother,  the  first  He.  By  placing  the  four  letters  of  the <br/>Tetragrammaton  in  a  vertical  column,  a  figure  closely  resembling  the  human  body  is  produced,  with <br/>Yod  for  the  head,  the  first  He  for  the  arms  and  shoulders.  Van  for  the  trunk  of  the  body,  and  the  final <br/>He  for  the  hips  and  legs.  If  the  Hebrew  letters  be  exchanged  for  their  English  equivalents,  the  form  is <br/><br/><br/>not  materially  changed  or  the  analogy  altered.  It  is  also  extremely  significant  that  by  inserting  the <br/>letter  ^,  Shin,  in  the  middle  of  the  name  Jehovah,  the  word  Jehoshua,  or  Jesus,  is  formed  thus: <br/><br/>In  the  Qabbalistic  Mysteries,  according  to  Eliphas  Levi,  the  name  Jehovah  is  occasionally  written  by <br/>connecting  together  24  dots&#x2014;the  24  powers  before  the  throne&#x2014;and  it  is  believed  that  the  name  of  the <br/>Power  of  Evil  is  the  sign  of  Jehovah  reversed  or  inverted.  (See  Transcendental  Magic.)  Of  the  Great <br/>Word,  Albert  Pike  writes:  &quot;The  True  Word  of  a  Mason  is  to  be  found  in  the  concealed  and  profound <br/>meaning  of  the  Ineffable  Name  of  Deity,  communicated  by  God  to  Moses;  and  which  meaning  was <br/>long  lost  by  the  very  precautions  taken  to  conceal  it.  The  true  pronunciation  of  that  name  was  in  truth <br/>a  secret,  in  which,  however,  was  involved  the  far  more  profound  secret  of  its  meaning.  In  that <br/>meaning  is  included  all  the  truth  that  can  be  known  by  us,  in  regard  to  the  nature  of  God.&quot;  (See <br/>Morals  and  Dogma.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  SEPHIROTH  IN  THE  FORM  OF  THE  SOLAR  SYSTEM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Maurice's  Indian  Antiquities. <br/><br/>Thomas  Maurice  reproduces  the  above  engraving,  which  is  modification  of  the  elaborate  tree  on  the  preceding  page.  The <br/><br/>Sephiroth  are  here  superimposed,  decreasing  in  size  as  they  decrease  in  power  and  dignity.  Thus,  the  Crown  is  the <br/>greatest  and  the  all-inclusive,  and  the  Kingdom&#x2014;which  represents  the  physical  universe&#x2014;is  the  smallest  and  of  least <br/>importance. <br/><br/><br/>p- 125 <br/><br/><br/>Qabbalistic  Keys  to  the  Creation  of  Man <br/><br/>HENRIE  STEPHEN,  in  A  World  of  Wonders,  published  in  1607,  mentions  a  monk  of  St.  Anthony <br/>who  declared  that  while  in  Jerusalem  the  patriarch  of  that  city  had  shown  him  not  only  one  of  the  ribs <br/>of  the  Word  made  flesh  and  some  rays  from  the  Star  of  Bethlehem,  but  also  the  snout  of  a  seraph,  a <br/>finger  nail  of  a  cherub,  the  horns  of  Moses,  and  a  casket  containing  the  breath  of  Christ!  To  a  people <br/>believing  implicitly  in  a  seraph  sufficiently  tangible  to  have  its  proboscis  preserved,  the  more <br/>profound  issues  of  Judaistic  philosophy  must  necessarily  be  incomprehensible.  Nor  is  it  difficult  to <br/>imagine  the  reaction  taking  place  in  the  mind  of  some  ancient  sage  should  he  hear  that  a  cherub&#x2014; <br/>which,  according  to  St.  Augustine,  signifies  the  Evangelists;  according  to  Philo  Judseus,  the  outermost <br/>circumference  of  the  entire  heavens,  and  according  to  several  of  the  Church  Fathers,  the  wisdom  of <br/>God&#x2014;had  sprouted  finger  nails.  The  hopeless  confusion  of  divine  principles  with  the  allegorical <br/>figures  created  to  represent  them  to  the  limited  faculties  of  the  uninitiated  has  resulted  in  the  most <br/>atrocious  misconceptions  of  spiritual  truths.  Concepts  well-nigh  as  preposterous  as  these,  however, <br/>still  stand  as  adamantine  barriers  to  a  true  understanding  of  Old  and  New  Testament  symbolism;  for, <br/>until  man  disentangles  his  reasoning  powers  from  the  web  of  venerated  absurdities  in  which  his  mind <br/>has  lain  ensnared  for  centuries,  how  can  Truth  ever  be  discovered? <br/><br/>The  Old  Testament&#x2014;especially  the  Pentateuch&#x2014; contains  not  only  the  traditional  account  of  the <br/>creation  of  the  world  and  of  man,  but  also,  locked  within  it,  the  secrets  of  the  Egyptian  initiators  of <br/>the  Moses  concerning  the  genesis  of  the  god-man  (the  initiate)  and  the  mystery  of  his  rebirth  through <br/>philosophy.  While  the  Lawgiver  of  Israel  is  known  to  have  compiled  several  works  other  than  those <br/>generally  attributed  to  him,  the  writings  now  commonly  circulated  as  the  purported  sixth  and  seventh <br/>books  of  Moses  are  in  reality  spurious  treatises  on  black  magic  foisted  on  the  credulous  during  the <br/>Middle  Ages.  Out  of  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  pious  and  thoughtful  students  of  Holy  Writ,  it  is <br/>almost  inconceivable  that  but  a  mere  handful  have  sensed  the  sublimity  of  the  esoteric  teachings  of <br/>Sod  (the  Jewish  Mysteries  of  Adonai).  Yet  familiarity  with  the  three  Qabbalistical  processes  termed <br/>Gematria,  Notarikon,  and  Temurah  makes  possible  the  discovery  of  many  of  the  profoundest  truths <br/>of  ancient  Jewish  superphysics. <br/><br/>By  Gematria  is  meant  not  only  the  exchange  of  letters  for  their  numerical  equivalents  but  also  the <br/>method  of  determining  by  an  analysis  of  its  measurements  the  mystic  purpose  for  which  a  building  or <br/>other  object  was  constructed.  S.  L.  MacGregor-Mathers,  in  The  Kabbalah  Unveiled,  gives  this <br/>example  of  the  application  of  Gematria:  &quot;Thus  also  the  passage.  Gen.  xviii.  2  VHNH  ShLShH, <br/>Vehenna  Shalisha,  'And  lo,  three  men,'  equals  in  numerical  value  'ALV  MIKAL  GBRIAL  VRPAL,  Elo <br/>Mikhael  Gabriel  Ve-Raphael,'  These  are  Mikhael,  Gabriel  and  Raphael;  'for  each  phrase  =  701.&quot; <br/>Assuming  the  sides  of  a  scalene  to  be  11,  9,  and  6  inches,  a  triangle  of  such  dimensions  would  then  be <br/>an  appropriate  symbol  of  Jehovah,  for  the  sum  of  its  three  sides  would  be  26,  the  numerical  value  of <br/>the  Hebrew  word  IHVH.  Gematria  also  includes  the  system  of  discovering  the  arcane  meaning  of  a <br/>word  by  analyzing  the  size  and  arrangement  of  the  strokes  employed  in  the  formation  of  its  various <br/>letters.  Gematria  was  employed  by  the  Greeks  as  well  as  the  Jews.  The  books  of  the  New  Testament&#x2014; <br/>particularly  those  attributed  to  St.  John&#x2014; contain  many  examples  of  its  use.  Nicephorus  Callistus <br/>declared  the  Gospel  according  to  St.  John  to  have  been  discovered  in  a  cavern  under  the  Temple  at <br/>Jerusalem,  the  volume  having  been  secreted  &quot;long  anterior  to  the  Christian  sera.&quot;  The  existence  of <br/>interpolated  material  in  the  fourth  Gospel  substantiates  the  belief  that  the  work  was  originally <br/>written  without  any  specific  reference  to  the  man  Jesus,  the  statements  therein  accredited  to  Him <br/>being  originally  mystical  discourses  delivered  by  the  personification  of  the  Universal  Mind.  The <br/>remaining  Johannine  writings&#x2014; the  Epistles  and  the  Apocalypse&#x2014; are  enshrouded  by  a  similar  veil  of <br/>mystery. <br/><br/><br/>By  Notarikon  each  letter  of  a  word  may  become  the  initial  character  of  a  new  word.  Thus  from <br/><br/>BRAShITh,  first  word  in  the  book  of  Genesis,  are  extracted  six  words  which  mean  that  &quot;in  the <br/>beginning  the  Elohim  saw  that  Israel  would  accept  the  law.&quot;  Mr.  MacGregor-Mathers  also  gives  six <br/>additional  examples  of  Notarikon  formed  from  the  above  word  by  Solomon  Meir  Ben  Moses,  a <br/>mediaeval  Qabbalist.  From  the  famous  acrostic  ascribed  to  the  Erjrthraean  Sibyl,  St.  Augustine  derived <br/>the  word  IX0YE,  which  by  Notarikon  was  expanded  into  the  phrase,  &quot;Jesus  Christ,  Son  of  God, <br/>Savior.&quot;  By  another  use  of  Notarikon,  directly  the  reverse  of  the  first,  the  initial,  last,  or  middle  letters <br/>of  the  words  of  a  sentence  may  be  joined  together  to  form  a  new  word  or  words.  For  example,  the <br/>name  Amen,  a[ir\y,  maybe  extracted  from  Tt3X]i'7a'']iN,  &quot;the  Lord  is  the  faithful  King.&quot;  Because  they  had <br/>embodied  these  cryptic  devices  in  their  sacred  writings,  the  ancient  priests  admonished  their  disciples <br/>never  to  translate,  edit,  or  rewrite  the  contents  of  the  sacred  books. . <br/><br/>Under  the  general  heading  of  Temurah  several  systems  may  be  grouped  and  explained  in  which <br/>various  letters  are  substituted  for  other  letters  according  to  prearranged  tables  or  certain <br/>mathematical  arrangements  of  letters,  regular  or  irregular.  Thus  the  alphabet  may  be  broken  into  two <br/>equal  parts  and  written  in  horizontal  lines  so  that  the  letters  of  the  lower  row  can  be  exchanged  for <br/>those  of  the  upper  row,  or  vice  versa.  By  this  procedure  the  letters  of  the  word  Kuzu  may  be <br/>exchanged  for  those  of  IHVH,  the  Tetragrammaton.  In  another  form  of  Temurah  the  letters  are <br/>merely  rearranged.,  rrriii'  is  the  stone  which  is  found  in  the  center  of  the  world,  from  which  point  the <br/>earth  spread  out  on  all  sides. <br/><br/><br/>THE  VISION  OF  EZEKIEL. <br/><br/><br/>From  The  &quot;Bear&quot;  Bible. <br/><br/>This  plate,  which  is  from  the  first  Protestant  Bible  published  in  Spanish,  shows  the  Mercavah,  or  chariot  of  Jehovah, <br/>which  appeared  to  Ezekiel  by  the  river  Chebar.  The  prophet  beheld  four  strange  creatures  (E),  each  having  four  heads, <br/>four  wings,  and  brazen  hoofs  like  those  of  a  calf.  And  there  were  four  wheels  (F)  filled  with  eyes.  Where  the  cherubim  went <br/>the  wheels  went  also.  The  space  between  the  cherubim  and  the  wheels  was  filled  with  coals  of  fire.  Upon  the  top  of  the <br/>chariot  was  a  throne,  upon  which  sat  the  likeness  of  a  man  (H).  Ezekiel  fell  upon  his  knees  when  he  beheld  the  Mercavah <br/>surrounded  by  a  whirlwind  of  clouds  and  flames  (A,  B,  C).  A  hand  (K)  reached  out  from  the  clouds  and  the  prophet  was <br/>ordered  to  eat  of  a  scroll  which  the  hand  held  forth. <br/><br/>According  to  the  mystics,  the  wheels  supporting  the  throne  of  God  represent  the  orbits  of  the  planets,  and  the  entire  solar <br/>system  is  properly  the  Mercavah,  or  chariot  of  God.  One  of  the  divisions  of  the  Qabbalah&#x2014;that  dealing  with  the  arts  and <br/><br/><br/>sciences  of  those  planes  which  are  under  the  heavens&#x2014;is  called  the  Mercavah.  In  the  Zohar  it  is  written  that  the  celestial <br/>throne  or  Ezekiel's  vision  signifies  the  traditional  law;  the  appearance  of  a  man  sitting  upon  the  throne  represents  the <br/>written  law,  Philo  Judaeus  in  describing  the  cherubim  upon  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant  declares  that  the  figures  are  an <br/>intimation  of  the  revolutions  of  the  whole  heavens,  one  of  the  cherubim  representing  the  outer  circumference  and  the <br/>other  the  inner  sphere.  Facing  each  other,  they  represent  the  two  hemispheres  of  the  world.  The  flaming  sword  of  the <br/>cherubim  of  Genesis  is  the  central  motion  and  agitation  of  the  heavenly  bodies.  In  all  probability  it  also  represents  the <br/>solar  ray. <br/><br/>p.  126 <br/><br/>When  broken  in  two  the  stone  is    m,  which  means  &quot;the  placing  of  God. &quot;(See  Pekudei  Rakov,  71,  72.) <br/>Again,  Temurah  may  consist  of  a  simple  anagram,  as  in  the  English  word  live,  which  reversed <br/>becomes  evil.  The  various  systems  of  Temurah  are  among  the  most  complicated  and  profound  devices <br/>of  the  ancient  Rabbins. <br/><br/>Among  theological  scholars  there  is  a  growing  conviction  that  the  hitherto  accepted  translations  of <br/>the  Scriptural  writings  do  not  adequately  express  the  spirit  of  the  original  documents. <br/><br/>&quot;After  the  first  copy  of  the  Book  of  God,&quot;  writes  H.  P.  Blavatsky,  &quot;has  been  edited  and  launched  on  the <br/>world  by  Hilkiah,  this  copy  disappears,  and  Ezra  has  to  make  a  new  Bible,  which  Judas  Maccabeus <br/>finishes;  *  *  *  when  it  was  copied  from  the  horned  letters  into  square  letters,  it  was  corrupted  beyond <br/>recognition;  *  *  *  the  Masorah  completed  the  work  of  destruction;  finally,  we  have  a  text,  not  900 <br/>years  old,  abounding  with  omissions,  interpolations,  and  premeditated  perversions.&quot;  (See  Isis <br/>Unveiled.) <br/><br/>Prof.  Crawford  Howell  Toy  of  Harvard  notes:  &quot;Manuscripts  were  copied  and  recopied  by  scribes  who <br/>not  only  sometimes  made  errors  in  letters  and  words,  but  permitted  themselves  to  introduce  new <br/>material  into  the  text,  or  to  combine  in  one  manuscript,  without  mark  of  division,  writings  composed <br/>by  different  men;  instances  of  these  sorts  of  procedure  are  found  especially  in  Micah  and  Jeremiah, <br/>and  the  groups  of  prophecies  which  go  under  the  names  of  Isaiah  and  Zachariah.&quot;  (See  Judaism  and <br/>Christianity.) <br/><br/>Does  the  mutilated  condition  of  the  Holy  Bible&#x2014;in  part  accidental&#x2014;represent  none  the  less  a  definite <br/>effort  to  confuse  the  uninitiated  reader  and  thus  better  conceal  the  secrets  of  the  Jewish  Tannaim? <br/>Never  has  the  Christian  world  been  in  possession  of  those  hidden  scrolls  which  contain  the  secret <br/>doctrine  of  Israel,  and  if  the  Qabbalists  were  correct  in  their  assumption  that  the  lost  books  of  the <br/>Mosaic  Mysteries  have  been  woven  into  the  fabric  of  the  Torah,  then  the  Scriptures  are  veritably <br/>books  within  books.  In  rabbinical  circles  the  opinion  is  prevalent  that  Christendom  never  has <br/>understood  the  Old  Testament  and  probably  never  will.  In  fact,  the  feeling  exists&#x2014; in  some  quarters,  at <br/>least&#x2014; that  the  Old  Testament  is  the  exclusive  possession  of  the  Jewish  faith;  also  that  Christianity, <br/>after  its  unrelenting  persecution  of  the  Jew,  takes  unwarranted  liberties  when  it  includes  strictly <br/>Jewish  writings  in  its  sacred  canon.  But,  as  noted  by  one  rabbi,  if  Christianity  must  use  the  Jewish <br/>Scriptures,  it  should  at  least  strive  to  do  so  with  some  degree  of  intelligence! <br/><br/>In  the  opening  chapter  of  Genesis  it  is  stated  that  after  creating  light  and  separating  it  from  darkness, <br/>the  seven  Elohim  divided  the  waters  which  were  under  the  firmament  from  the  waters  which  were <br/>above  the  firmament.  Having  thus  established  the  inferior  universe  in  perfect  accord  with  the  esoteric <br/>teachings  of  the  Hindu,  Egyptian,  and  Greek  Mysteries,  the  Elohim  next  turned  their  attention  to  the <br/>production  of  flora  and  fauna  and  lastly  man.  &quot;And  God  said.  Let  us  make  man  in  our  image,  after  our <br/>likeness.  *  *  *  So  God  created  man  in  his  own  image,  in  the  image  of  God  created  he  him;  male  and <br/>female  created  he  them.  And  God  blessed  them,  and  God  said  unto  them.  Be  fruitful,  and  multiply, <br/>and  replenish  the  earth,  *  *  *.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Consider  in  thoughtful  silence  the  startling  use  of  pronouns  in  the  above  extract  from  &quot;the  most <br/>perfect  example  of  English  literature.&quot;  When  the  plural  and  androgynous  Hebrew  word  Elohim  was <br/>translated  into  the  singular  and  sexless  word  God,  the  opening  chapters  of  Genesis  were  rendered <br/>comparatively  meaningless.  It  may  have  been  feared  that  had  the  word  been  correctly  translated  as <br/>&quot;the  male  and  female  creative  agencies,&quot;  the  Christians  would  have  been  justly  accused  of  worshiping <br/>a  plurality  of  gods  in  the  face  of  their  repeated  claims  to  monotheism!  The  plural  form  of  the <br/>pronouns  us  and  our  reveals  unmistakably,  however,  the  pantheistic  nature  of  Divinity.  Further,  the <br/>androgynous  constitution  of  the  Elohim  (God)  is  disclosed  in  the  next  verse,  where  he  (referring  to <br/>God)  is  said  to  have  created  man  in  his  own  image,  male  and  female;  or,  more  properly,  as  the <br/>division  of  the  sexes  had  not  yet  taken  place,  male-female.  This  is  a  deathblow  to  the  time-honored <br/>concept  that  God  is  a  masculine  potency  as  portrayed  by  Michelangelo  on  the  ceiling  of  the  Sistine <br/>Chapel.  The  Elohim  then  order  these  androgynous  beings  to  be  fruitful.  Note  that  neither  the <br/>masculine  nor  the  feminine  principle  as  yet  existed  in  a  separate  state!  And,  lastly,  note  the  word <br/>&quot;replenish.&quot;  The  prefix  re  denotes  &quot;back  to  an  original  or  former  state  or  position,&quot;  or  &quot;repetition  or <br/>restoration.&quot;  (See  Webster's  International  Dictionary,  1926.)  This  definite  reference  to  a  humanity <br/>existing  prior  to  the  &quot;creation  of  man&quot;  described  in  Genesis  must  be  evident  to  the  most  casual  reader <br/>of  Scripture. <br/><br/>An  examination  of  Bible  dictionaries,  encyclopedias,  and  commentaries  discloses  the  plural  form  of <br/>the  word  Elohim  to  be  beyond  the  comprehension  of  their  respected  authors  and  editors.  The  New <br/>Schaff-Herzog  Encyclopedia  of  Religious  Knowledge  thus  sums  up  the  controversy  over  the  plural <br/>form  of  the  word  Elohim:  &quot;Does  it  now  or  did  it  originally  signify  plurality  of  divine  being?&quot;  A <br/>Dictionary  of  the  Bible,  edited  by  James  Hastings,  contains  the  following  conclusion,  which  echoes <br/>the  sentiments  of  more  critical  etymologists  of  the  Bible:  &quot;The  use  of  the  plur.  Elohim  is  also  difficult <br/>to  explain.&quot;  Dr.  Havernick  considers  the  plural  form  Elohim  to  signify  the  abundance  and  super- <br/>richness  existing  in  the  Divine  Being.  His  statement,  which  appears  in  The  Popular  and  Critical  Bible <br/>Encyclopaedia,  is  representative  of  the  efforts  made  to  circumvent  this  extremely  damaging  word.  The <br/>International  Standard  Bible  Dictionary  considers  the  explanations  offered  by  modern  theologians&#x2014; <br/>of  which  Dr.  Havemick's  is  a  fair  example&#x2014;to  be  too  ingenious  to  have  been  conceived  by  the  early <br/>Hebrews  and  maintains  that  the  word  represents  the  survival  of  a  polytheistic  stage  of  Semitic <br/>thought.  The  Jewish  Encyclopedia  supports  the  latter  assumption  with  the  following  concise <br/>statement:  &quot;As  far  as  epigraphic  material,  traditions,  and  folk-lore  throw  light  on  the  question,  the <br/>Semites  are  shown  to  be  of  polytheistic  leanings.&quot; <br/><br/>Various  schools  of  philosophy,  both  Jewish  and  Gentile,  have  offered  explanations  erudite  and <br/>otherwise  of  the  identity  of  Adam.  In  this  primordial  man  the  Neo-Platonists  recognized  the  Platonic <br/>Idea  of  humanity&#x2014;the  archetype  or  pattern  of  the  genus  homo.  Philo  Judeeus  considered  Adam  to <br/>represent  the  human  mind,  which  could  understand  (and  hence  give  names  to)  the  creatures  about  it, <br/>but  could  not  comprehend  (and  hence  left  nameless)  the  mystery  of  its  own  nature.  Adam  was  also <br/>likened  to  the  Pythagorean  monad  which  by  virtue  of  its  state  of  perfect  unity  could  dwell  in  the <br/>Edenic  sphere.  When  through  a  process  akin  to  fission  the  monad  became  the  duad&#x2014; the  proper <br/>symbol  of  discord  and  delusion&#x2014; the  creature  thus  formed  was  exiled  from  its  celestial  home.  Thus  the <br/>twofold  man  was  driven  from  the  Paradise  belonging  to  the  undivided  creation  and  cherubim  and  a <br/>flaming  sword  were  placed  on  guard  at  the  gates  of  the  Causal  World.  Consequently,  only  after  the <br/>reestablishment  of  unity  within  himself  can  man  regain  his  primal  spiritual  state. <br/><br/>According  to  the  Isarim,  the  secret  doctrine  of  Israel  taught  the  existence  of  four  Adams,  each <br/>dwelling  in  one  of  the  four  Qabbalistic  worlds.  The  first,  or  heavenly,  Adam  dwelt  alone  in  the <br/>Atziluthic  sphere  and  within  his  nature  existed  all  spiritual  and  material  potentialities.  The  second <br/>Adam  resided  in  the  sphere  of  Briah.  Like  the  first  Adam,  this  being  was  androgynous  and  the  tenth <br/>division  of  its  body  (its  heel,  Malchuth)  corresponded  to  the  church  of  Israel  that  shall  bruise  the <br/>serpent's  head.  The  third  Adam&#x2014; likewise  androgynous&#x2014; was  clothed  in  a  body  of  light  and  abode  in <br/>the  sphere  of  Yetzirah.  The  fourth  Adam  was  merely  the  third  Adam  after  the  fall  into  the  sphere  of <br/><br/><br/>Assiah,  at  which  time  the  spiritual  man  took  upon  himself  the  animal  shell  or  coat  of  skins.  The <br/>fourth  Adam  was  still  considered  as  a  single  individual,  though  division  had  taken  place  within  his <br/>nature  and  two  shells  or  physical  bodies  existed,  in  one  of  which  was  incarnated  the  masculine  and  in <br/>the  other  the  feminine  potency.  (For  further  details  consult  Isaac  Myer.) <br/><br/>The  universal  nature  of  Adam  is  revealed  in  the  various  accounts  concerning  the  substances  of  which <br/>he  was  formed.  It  was  originally  ordained  that  the  &quot;dirt&quot;  to  be  used  in  fashioning  him  was  to  be <br/>derived  from  the  seven  worlds.  As  these  planes,  however,  refused  to  give  of  their  substances,  the <br/>Creator  wrenched  from  them  by  force  the  elements  to  be  employed  in  the  Adamic  constitution.  St. <br/>Augustine  discovered  a  Notarikon  in  the  name  of  Adam.  He  showed  that  the  four  letters,  A-D-A-M, <br/>are  the  first  letters  of  the  four  words  Anafo/e  Dysis  Arktos  Mesembria,  the  Greek  names  for  the  four <br/>corners  of  the  world.  The  same  author  also  sees  in  Adam  a  prototype  of  Christ,  for  he  writes:  &quot;Adam <br/>sleeps  that  Eve  maybe  formed:  Christ  dies,  that  the  Church  maybe  formed.  While  Adam  sleeps,  Eve <br/>is  formed  from  his  side.  When  Christ  is  dead.  His  side  is  smitten  with  a  spear,  that  there  flow  forth <br/>sacraments  to  form  the  church.  *  *  *  Adam  himself  was  the  figure  of  Him  that  was  to  come.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  recent  work,  Judaism,  George  Foote  Moore  thus  describes  the  proportions  of  the  Adamic  man: <br/>&quot;He  was  a  huge  mass  that  filled  the  whole  world  to  all  the  points  of  the  compass.  The  dust  of  which <br/>his  body  was  formed  was  gathered  from  every  part  of  the  world,  or  from  the  site  of  the  future  altar.  Of <br/>greater  interest  is  the  notion  that  man  was  created  androgynous,  because  it  is  probably  a  bit  of  foreign <br/>lore  adapted  to  the  first  pair  in  Genesis.  R.  Samuel  bar  Nahman  (third  century),  said,  when  God <br/>created  Adam,  He  created  him  facing  both  ways  (D''3iyi3  vi);  then  He  sawed  him  in  two  and  made  two <br/>backs,  one  for  each  figure. <br/><br/>The  Zohar  holds  the  concept  of  two  Adams:  the  first  a  divine  being  who,  stepping  forth  from  the <br/>highest  original  darkness,  created  the  second,  or  earthly,  Adam  in  His  own  image.  The  higher,  or <br/>celestial,  man  was  the  Causal  sphere  With  its  divine  potencies  and  potentialities  considered  as  a <br/>gigantic  personality;  its  members,  according  to  the  Gnostics,  being  the  basic  elements  of  existence. <br/>This  Adam  may  have  been  symbolized  as  facing  both  ways  to  signify  that  with  one  face  it  looked  upon <br/>the  proximate  Cause  of  itself  and  with  the  other  face  looked  upon  the  vast  sea  of  Cosmos  into  which  it <br/>was  to  be  immersed. <br/><br/>Philosophically,  Adam  may  be  regarded  as  representative  of  the  full  spiritual  nature  of  man- <br/>androgynous  and  nor  subject  to  decay. <br/><br/>p.  127 <br/><br/>Of  this  fuller  nature  the  mortal  man  has  little  comprehension.  Just  as  spirit  contains  matter  within <br/>itself  and  is  both  the  source  and  ultimate  of  the  state  denominated  matter,  so  Eve  represents  the <br/>lower,  or  mortal,  portion  that  is  taken  out  of,  or  has  temporal  existence  in  the  greater  and  fuller <br/>spiritual  creation.  Being  representative  of  the  inferior  part  of  the  individual.  Eve  is  the  temptress  who, <br/>conspiring  with  the  serpent  of  mortal  knowledge,  caused  Adam  to  sink  into  a  trancelike  condition  in <br/>which  he  was  unconscious  of  his  own  higher  Self.  When  Adam  seemingly  awoke,  he  actually  sank  into <br/>sleep,  for  he  no  longer  was  in  the  spirit  but  in  the  body;  division  having  taken  place  within  him,  the <br/>true  Adam  rested  in  Paradise  while  his  lesser  part  incarnated  in  a  material  organism  (Eve)  and <br/>wandered  in  the  darkness  of  mortal  existence. <br/><br/>The  followers  of  Mohammed  apparently  sensed  more  accurately  than  the  uninitiated  of  other  sects <br/>the  true  mystic  import  of  Paradise,  for  they  realized  that  prior  to  his  fall  the  dwelling  place  of  man <br/>was  not  in  a  physical  garden  in  any  particular  part  of  the  earth  but  rather  in  a  higher  sphere  (the <br/>angelic  world)  watered  by  four  mystical  streams  of  life.  After  his  banishment  from  Paradise,  Adam <br/>alighted  on  the  Island  of  Ceylon,  and  this  spot  is  sacred  to  certain  Hindu  sects  who  recognize  the  old <br/>Island  of  Lanka&#x2014;once  presumably  connected  with  the  mainland  by  a  bridge&#x2014; as  the  actual  site  of  the <br/><br/><br/>Garden  of  Eden  from  which  the  human  race  migrated.  According  to  the  Arabian  Nights  (Sir  Richard <br/><br/>Burton's  translation),  Adam's  footprint  may  still  be  seen  on  the  top  of  a  Ceylonese  mountain.  In  the <br/>Islamic  legends,  Adam  was  later  reunited  with  his  wife  and  after  his  death  his  body  was  brought  to <br/>Jerusalem  subsequent  to  the  Flood  for  burial  by  Melchizedek.  (See  the  Koran.) <br/><br/>The  word  ADM  signifies  a  species  or  race  and  only  for  lack  of  proper  understanding  has  Adam  been <br/>considered  as  an  individual.  As  the  Macrocosm,  Adam  is  the  gigantic  Androgyne,  even  the  Demiurgus; <br/>as  the  Microcosm,  he  is  the  chief  production  of  the  Demiurgus  and  within  the  nature  of  the <br/>Microcosm  the  Demiurgus  established  all  the  qualities  and  powers  which  He  Himself  possessed.  The <br/>Demiurgus,  however,  did  not  possess  immortality  and,  therefore,  could  not  bestow  it  upon  Adam. <br/>According  to  legend,  the  Demiurgus  strove  to  keep  man  from  learning  the  incompleteness  of  his <br/>Maker.  The  Adamic  man  consequently  partook  of  the  qualities  and  characteristics  of  the  angels  who <br/>were  the  ministers  of  the  Demiurgus.  It  was  affirmed  by  the  Gnostic  Christians  that  the  redemption  of <br/>humanity  was  assured  through  the  descent  of  Nous  (Universal  Mind),  who  was  a  great  spiritual  being <br/>superior  to  the  Demiurgus  and  who,  entering  into  the  constitution  of  man,  conferred  conscious <br/>immortality  upon  the  Demiurgic  fabrications. <br/><br/>That  phallic  symbolism  occupies  an  important  place  in  early  Jewish  mysticism  is  indisputable. <br/>Hargrave  Jennings  sees  in  the  figure  of  Adam  a  type  of  the  lingam  of  Shiva,  which  was  a  stone <br/>representative  of  the  creative  power  of  the  World  Generator.  &quot;In  Gregorie's  works  *  *  *,&quot;  writes <br/>Jennings,  &quot;is  a  passage  to  the  effect  that  'Noah  daily  prayed  in  the  Ark  before  the  Body  of  Adam,'  i.e., <br/>before  the  Phallus&#x2014;Adam  being  the  primitive  Phallus,  great  procreator  of  the  human  race.  'It  may <br/>possibly  seem  strange,'  he  says,  'that  this  orison  should  be  daily  said  before  the  body  of  Adam,'  but  'it <br/>is  a  most  confessed  tradition  among  the  eastern  men  that  Adam  was  commanded  by  God  that  his <br/>dead  body  should  be  kept  above  ground  till  a  fullness  of  time  should  come  to  commit  it  yix'^iODisto  the <br/>middle  of  the  earth  by  a  priest  of  the  Most  High  God.'  This  means  Mount  Moriah,  the  Meru  of  India. <br/>'This  body  of  Adam  was  embalmed  and  transmitted  from  father  to  son,  till  at  last  it  was  delivered  up <br/>by  Lamech  into  the  hands  of  Noah.'&quot;  (See  Phallicism.) <br/><br/>This  interpretation  somewhat  clarifies  the  Qabbalistic  assertion  that  in  the  first  Adam  were  contained <br/>all  the  souls  of  the  Israelites.  (See  Sod.)  Though  according  to  the  Aurea  Legenda  Adam  was  buried <br/>with  the  three  seeds  of  the  Tree  of  Knowledge  in  his  mouth,  it  should  be  borne  in  mind  that <br/>apparently  conflicting  myths  were  often  woven  around  a  single  individual.  One  of  the  profound <br/>mysteries  of  Qabbalism  is  that  set  forth  in  the  Notarikon  based  upon  the  letters  of  the  name  Adam <br/>(ADM).  These  three  letters  form  the  initials  of  the  names  Adam,  David,  and  the  Messiah,  and  these <br/>three  personalities  were  said  to  contain  one  soul.  As  this  soul  represents  the  World  Soul  of  humanity, <br/>Adam  signifies  the  involving  soul,  the  Messiah  the  evolving  soul,  and  David  that  condition  of  the  soul <br/>termed  epigenesis. <br/><br/>In  common  with  certain  philosophic  institutions  of  Asia,  the  Jewish  Mysteries  contained  a  strange <br/>doctrine  concerning  the  shadows  of  the  Gods.  Gazing  down  into  the  Abyss,  the  Elohim  beheld  their <br/>own  shadows  and  from  these  shadows  patterned  the  inferior  creation.  &quot;In  the  dramatic <br/>representation  of  the  creation  of  man  in  the  Mysteries,&quot;  writes  the  anonymous  Master  of  Balliol <br/>College,  &quot;the  Aleim  [Elohim]  were  represented  by  men  who,  when  sculpturing  the  form  of  an  Adamite <br/>being,  of  a  man,  traced  the  outline  of  it  on  their  own  shadow,  or  modelled  it  on  their  own  shadow <br/>traced  on  the  wall.  This  is  how  the  art  of  drawing  originated  in  Egypt,  and  the  hieroglyphic  figures <br/>carved  on  the  Egyptian  monuments  have  so  little  relief  that  they  still  resemble  a  shadow.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  ritualism  of  the  early  Jewish  Mysteries  the  pageantry  of  creation  was  enacted,  the  various <br/>actors  impersonating  the  Creative  Agencies.  The  red  dirt  from  which  the  Adamic  man  was  fashioned <br/>may  signify  fire,  particularly  since  Adam  is  related  to  the  Yod,  or  fire  flame,  which  is  the  first  letter  of <br/>the  sacred  name  Jehovah.  In  John  ii.  20  it  is  written  that  the  Temple  was  forty  and  six  years  in  the <br/>building,  a  statement  in  which  St.  Augustine  sees  a  secret  and  sacred  Gematria;  for,  according  to  the <br/><br/><br/>Greek  philosophy  of  numbers,  the  numerical  value  of  the  name  Adam  is  46.  Adam  thus  becomes  the <br/>type  of  the  Temple,  for  the  House  of  God-like  primitive  man &#x2014;was  a  microcosm  or  epitome  of  the <br/>universe. <br/><br/>In  the  Mysteries,  Adam  is  accredited  with  having  the  peculiar  power  of  spiritual  generation.  Instead <br/>of  reproducing  his  kind  by  the  physical  generative  processes,  he  caused  to  issue  from  himself &#x2014;or, <br/>more  correctly,  to  be  reflected  upon  substance&#x2014;a  shadow  of <br/><br/><br/>NOAH  AND  HIS  ZODIACAL  ARK. <br/><br/>From  Myer's  Qabbalah. <br/><br/>The  early  Church  Father&#x2014;notably  Tertullian,  Firmilian,  St.  Cyprian,  St.  Augustine,  and  St.  Chrysostom&#x2014;recognized  in  the <br/>ark  a  type  or  symbol  of  the  Holy  Catholic  Church.  Bede  the  Venerable,  declared  that  Noah  in  all  things  typified  Christ  as <br/>Noah  alone  of  his  generation  was  just,  so  Christ  alone  was  without  sin.  With  Christ  there  was  a  sevenfold  spirit  of  grace: <br/>with  Noah  seven  righteous  Persons.  Noah  by  water  and  wood  saved  his  own  family  Christ  by  baptism  and  the  cross  saves <br/>Christians.  The  ark  was  built  of  wood  that  did  not  decay,  the  church  is  composed  of  men  who  will  live  forever,  for  this  ark <br/>means  the  church  which  floats  upon  the  waves  of  the  world. <br/><br/>The  diagram  shown  above  is  also  reproduced  in  The  Rosicrucians,  by  Hargrave  Jennings.  This  author  adds  to  the  original <br/>diagram  appearing  in  Antiquitatum  Judaicarum  Libri  IX  the  signs  of  the  zodiac,  placing  Aries  at  the  head  and  continuing <br/>in  sequential  order  to  Leo,  which  occupies  the  fifth  cross  section  of  the  ark.  Jennings  assigns  the  panel  containing  the  door <br/>to  the  undivided  constellation  of  Virgo-Libra-Scorpio  (which  is  continued  into  the  first  subdivision  of  the  second  section) <br/>and  the  remaining  four  cress  sections  to  the  constellations  of  Sagittarius  to  Pisces  inclusive.  A  study  of  the  plate  discloses <br/>the  ark  to  be  divided  into  eleven  main  sections,  and  along  the  base  and  roof  of  each  section  are  shown  three  subdivisions, <br/>thus  making  in  all  the  sacred  number  33.  Occupying  the  position  corresponding  to  the  generative  system  of  the  human <br/>body  will  also  be  noted  the  cross  upon  the  door  of  the  central  section.  Two  openings  are  shown  in  the  ark:  one&#x2014;the  main <br/>door  representing  the  orifice  through  which  the  animal  lives  descend  into  physical  existence;  the  other  a  small  window <br/>proximate  to  the  crown  of  the  head  through  which  the  spirit  gains  liberty  according  to  the  ancient  rites. <br/><br/>&quot;When  the  androgenic  Scorpio-Virgo  was  separated  and  the  Balance  or  Harmony  made  from  Scorpio,  and  placed  between <br/>Scorpio,  i.e.,  male,  and  Virgo,  i.e.,  female,  then  appeared  the  32  constellations  or  signs,  as  we  now  have  them.  The  ark  is <br/>three  stories  high  (perhaps  to  symbolize  Heaven,  Man,  Earth).  In  the  figure  of  the  Man,  notice  the  parting  of  the  hair  in <br/>the  middle  of  the  forehead  and  the  arrangement  of  the  beard,  whiskers,  moustache  and  the  hair,  on  the  back  of  the  neck <br/>and  shoulders.&quot;  (See  The  Qabbalah  by  Isaac  Myer.) <br/><br/>p.  128 <br/><br/>himself.  This  shadow  he  then  ensouled  and  it  became  a  living  creature.  These  shadows,  however, <br/>remain  only  as  long  as  the  original  figure  of  which  they  are  the  reflections  endures,  for  with  the <br/><br/><br/>removal  of  the  original  the  host  of  likenesses  vanish  with  it.  Herein  is  the  key  to  the  allegorical <br/><br/>creation  of  Eve  out  of  the  side  of  Adam;  for  Adam,  representative  of  the  idea  or  pattern,  is  reflected <br/>into  the  material  universe  as  a  multitude  of  ensouled  images  which  collectively  are  designated  Eve. <br/>According  to  another  theory,  the  division  of  the  sexes  took  place  in  the  archetypal  sphere;  hence  the <br/>shadows  in  the  lower  world  were  divided  into  two  classes  consistent  with  the  orders  established  in  the <br/>Archetype.  In  the  apparently  incomprehensible  attraction  of  one  sex  for  the  other  Plato  recognized  a <br/>cosmic  urge  toward  reunion  of  the  severed  halves  of  this  archetypal  Being. <br/><br/>Exactly  what  is  to  be  inferred  by  the  division  of  the  sexes  as  symbolically  described  in  Genesis  is  a <br/>much-debated  question.  That  man  was  primarily  androgynous  is  quite  universally  conceded  and  it  is <br/>a  reasonable  presumption  that  he  will  ultimately  regain  this  bisexual  state.  As  to  the  manner  in  which <br/>this  will  be  accomplished  two  opinions  are  advanced.  One  school  of  thought  affirms  that  the  human <br/>soul  was  actually  divided  into  two  parts  (male  and  female)  and  that  man  remains  an  unperfected <br/>creature  until  these  parts  are  reunited  through  the  emotion  which  man  calls  love.  From  this  concept <br/>has  grown  the  much-abused  doctrine  of  &quot;soul  mates&quot;  who  must  quest  through  the  ages  until  the <br/>complementary  part  of  each  severed  soul  is  discovered.  The  modern  concept  of  marriage  is  to  a <br/>certain  degree  founded  upon  this  ideal. <br/><br/>According  to  the  other  school,  the  so-called  division  of  the  sexes  resulted  from  suppression  of  one <br/>pole  of  the  androgynous  being  in  order  that  the  vital  energies  manifesting  through  it  might  be <br/>diverted  to  development  of  the  rational  faculties.  From  this  point  of  view  man  is  still  actually <br/>androgynous  and  spiritually  complete,  but  in  the  material  world  the  feminine  part  of  man's  nature <br/>and  the  masculine  part  of  woman's  nature  are  quiescent.  Through  spiritual  unfoldment  and <br/>knowledge  imparted  by  the  Mysteries,  however,  the  latent  element  in  each  nature  is  gradually <br/>brought  into  activity  and  ultimately  the  human  being  thus  regains  sexual  equilibrium.  By  this  theory <br/>woman  is  elevated  from  the  position  of  being  man's  errant  part  to  one  of  complete  equality.  From  this <br/>point  of  view,  marriage  is  regarded  as  a  companionship  in  which  two  complete  individualities <br/>manifesting  opposite  polarities  are  brought  into  association  that  each  may  thereby  awaken  the <br/>qualities  latent  in  the  other  and  thus  assist  in  the  attainment  of  individual  completeness.  The  first <br/>theory  maybe  said  to  regard  marriage  as  an  end;  the  second  as  a  means  to  an  end.  The  deeper  schools <br/>of  philosophy  have  leaned  toward  the  latter  as  more  adequately  acknowledging  the  infinite <br/>potentialities  of  divine  completeness  in  both  aspects  of  creation. <br/><br/>The  Christian  Church  is  fundamentally  opposed  to  the  theory  of  marriage,  claiming  that  the  highest <br/>degree  of  spirituality  is  achievable  only  by  those  preserving  the  virginal  state.  This  concept  seemingly <br/>originated  among  certain  sects  of  the  early  Gnostic  Christians,  who  taught  that  to  propagate  the <br/>human  species  was  to  increase  and  perpetuate  the  power  of  the  Demiurgus;  for  the  lower  world  was <br/>looked  upon  as  an  evil  fabrication  created  to  ensnare  the  souls  of  all  born  into  it &#x2014;hence  it  was  a  crime <br/>to  assist  in  bringing  souls  to  earth.  When,  therefore,  the  unfortunate  father  or  mother  shall  stand <br/>before  the  Final  Tribunal,  all  their  offspring  will  also  appear  and  accuse  them  of  being  the  cause  of <br/>those  miseries  attendant  upon  physical  existence.  This  view  is  strengthened  by  the  allegory  of  Adam <br/>and  Eve,  whose  sin  through  which  humanity  has  been  brought  low  is  universally  admitted  to  have <br/>been  concerned  with  the  mystery  of  generation.  Mankind,  owing  to  Father  Adam  its  physical <br/>existence,  regards  its  progenitor  as  the  primary  cause  of  its  misery;  and  in  the  judgment  Day,  rising <br/>up  as  a  mighty  progeny,  will  accuse  its  common  paternal  ancestor. <br/><br/>Those  Gnostic  sects  maintaining  a  more  rational  attitude  on  the  subject  declared  the  very  existence  of <br/>the  lower  worlds  to  signify  that  the  Supreme  Creator  had  a  definite  purpose  in  their  creation;  to  doubt <br/>his  judgment  was,  therefore,  a  grievous  error.  The  church,  however,  seemingly  arrogated  to  itself  the <br/>astonishing  prerogative  of  correcting  God  in  this  respect,  for  wherever  possible  it  continued  to  impose <br/>celibacy,  a  practice  resulting  in  an  alarming  number  of  neurotics.  In  the  Mysteries,  celibacy  is <br/>reserved  for  those  who  have  reached  a  certain  degree  of  spiritual  unfoldment.  When  advocated  for  the <br/>mass  of  unenlightened  humanity,  however,  it  becomes  a  dangerous  heresy,  fatal  alike  to  both  religion <br/><br/><br/>and  philosophy.  As  Christendom  in  its  fanaticism  has  blamed  every  individual  Jew  for  the  crucifixion <br/>of  Jesus,  so  with  equal  consistency  it  has  maligned  every  member  of  the  feminine  sex.  In  vindication <br/>of  Eve  philosophy  claims  that  the  allegory  signifies  merely  that  man  is  tempted  by  his  emotions  to <br/>depart  from  the  sure  path  of  reason. <br/><br/>Many  of  the  early  Church  Fathers  sought  to  establish  a  direct  relationship  between  Adam  and  Christ, <br/>thereby  obviously  discounting  the  extremely  sinful  nature  of  man's  common  ancestor,  since  it  is  quite <br/>certain  that  when  St.  Augustine  likens  Adam  to  Christ  and  Eve  to  the  church  he  does  not  intend  to <br/>brand  the  latter  institution  as  the  direct  cause  of  the  fall  of  man.  For  some  inexplicable  reason, <br/>however,  religion  has  ever  regarded  intellectualism~in  fact  every  form  of  knowledge&#x2014;as  fatal  to <br/>man's  spiritual  growth.  The  Ignaratitine  Friars  are  an  outstanding  example  of  this  attitude. <br/><br/>In  this  ritualistic  drama&#x2014;possibly  derived  from  the  Egyptians&#x2014; Adam,  banished  from  the  Garden  of <br/>Eden,  represents  man  philosophically  exiled  from  the  sphere  of  Truth.  Through  ignorance  man  falls; <br/>through  wisdom  he  redeems  himself.  The  Garden  of  Eden  represents  the  House  of  the  Mysteries  (see <br/>The  Vision  of  Enoch)  in  the  midst  of  which  grew  both  the  Tree  of  Life  and  the  Tree  of  the  Knowledge <br/>of  Good  and  Evil. <br/><br/>Man,  the  banished  Adam,  seeks  to  pass  from  the  outer  court  of  the  Sanctuary  (the  exterior  universe) <br/>into  the  sanctum  sanctorum,  but  before  him  rises  a  vast  creature  armed  with  a  flashing  sword  that, <br/>moving  slowly  but  continually,  sweeps  clear  a  wide  circle,  and  through  this  &quot;Ring  Pass  Not&quot;  the <br/>Adamic  man  cannot  break. <br/><br/>The  cherubim  address  the  seeker  thus:  &quot;Man,  thou  art  dust  and  to  dust  thou  shalt  return.  Thou  wert <br/>fashioned  by  the  Builder  of  Forms;  thou  belongest  to  the  sphere  of  form,  and  the  breath  that  was <br/>breathed  into  thy  soul  was  the  breath  of  form  and  like  a  flame  it  shall  flicker  out.  More  than  thou  art <br/>thou  canst  not  be.  Thou  art  a  denizen  of  the  outer  world  and  it  is  forbidden  thee  to  enter  this  inner <br/>place.&quot; <br/><br/>And  the  Adam  replies:  &quot;Many  times  have  I  stood  within  this  courtyard  and  begged  admission  to  my <br/>Father's  house  and  thou  hast  refused  it  me  and  sent  me  back  to  wander  in  darkness.  True  it  is  that  I <br/>was  fashioned  out  of  the  dirt  and  that  my  Maker  could  not  confer  upon  me  the  boon  of  immortality. <br/>But  no  more  shalt  thou  send  me  away;  for,  wandering  in  the  darkness,  I  have  discovered  that  the <br/>Almighty  hath  decreed  my  salvation  because  He  hath  sent  out  of  the  most  hidden  Mystery  His  Only <br/>Begotten  who  didst  take  upon  Himself  the  world  fashioned  by  the  Demiurgus.  Upon  the  elements  of <br/>that  world  was  He  crucified  and  from  Him  hath  poured  forth  the  blood  of  my  salvation.  And  God, <br/>entering  into  His  creation,  hath  quickened  it  and  established  therein  a  road  that  leadeth  to  Himself. <br/>While  my  Maker  could  not  give  me  immortality,  immortality  was  inherent  in  the  very  dust  of  which  I <br/>was  composed,  for  before  the  world  was  fabricated  and  before  the  Demiurgus  became  the  Regent  of <br/>Nature  the  Eternal  Life  had  impressed  itself  upon  the  face  of  Cosmos.  This  is  its  sign&#x2014; the  Cross.  Do <br/>you  now  deny  me  entrance,  I  who  have  at  last  learned  the  mystery  of  myself?&quot; <br/><br/>And  the  voice  replies:  &quot;He  who  is  aware,  IS\  Behold!&quot; <br/><br/>Gazing  about  him,  Adam  finds  himself  in  a  radiant  place,  in  the  midst  of  which  stands  a  tree  with <br/>flashing  jewels  for  fruit  and  entwined  about  its  trunk  a  flaming,  winged  serpent  crowned  with  a <br/>diadem  of  stars.  It  was  the  voice  of  the  serpent  that  had  spoken. <br/><br/>&quot;Who  art  thou?&quot;  demands  the  Adam. <br/><br/>&quot;I,&quot;  the  serpent  answers,  &quot;am  Satan  who  was  stoned;  I  am  the  Adversary&#x2014; the  Lord  who  is  against  you, <br/>the  one  who  pleads  for  your  destruction  before  the  Eternal  Tribunal.  I  was  your  enemy  upon  the  day <br/>that  you  were  formed;  I  have  led  you  into  temptation;  I  have  delivered  you  into  the  hands  of  evil;  I <br/><br/><br/>have  maligned  you;  I  have  striven  ever  to  achieve  your  undoing.  I  am  the  guardian  of  the  Tree  of <br/>Knowledge  and  I  have  sworn  that  none  whom  I  can  lead  astray  shall  partake  of  its  fruits.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Adam  replies:  &quot;For  uncounted  ages  have  I  been  thy  servant.  In  my  ignorance  I  listened  to  thy <br/>words  and  they  led  me  into  paths  of  sorrow.  Thou  hast  placed  in  my  mind  dreams  of  power,  and  when <br/>I  struggled  to  realize  those  dreams  they  brought  me  naught  but  pain.  Thou  hast  sowed  in  me  the <br/>seeds  of  desire,  and  when  I  lusted  after  the  things  of  the  flesh  agony  was  my  only  recompense.  Thou <br/>hast  sent  me  false  prophets  and  false  reasoning,  and  when  I  strove  to  grasp  the  magnitude  of  Truth  I <br/>found  thy  laws  were  false  and  only  dismay  rewarded  my  strivings.  I  am  done  with  thee  forever,  O <br/>artful  Spirit!  I  have  tired  of  thy  world  of  illusions.  No  longer  will  I  labor  in  thy  vineyards  of  iniquity. <br/>Get  thee  behind  me,  rempter,  and  the  host  of  thy  temptations.  There  is  no  happiness,  no  peace,  no <br/>good,  no  future  in  the  doctrines  of  selfishness,  hate,  and  passion  preached  by  thee.  All  these  things  do <br/>I  cast  aside.  Renounced  is  thy  rule  forever!&quot; <br/><br/>And  the  serpent  makes  answer:  &quot;Behold,  O  Adam,  the  nature  of  thy  Adversary!&quot;  The  serpent <br/>disappears  in  a  blinding  sunburst  of  radiance  and  in  its  place  stands  an  angel  resplendent  in  shining, <br/>golden  garments  with  great  scarlet  wings  that  spread  from  one  corner  of  the  heavens  to  the  other. <br/>Dismayed  and  awestruck,  the  Adam  falls  before  the  divine  creature. <br/><br/>&quot;I  am  the  Lord  who  is  against  thee  and  thus  accomplishes  thy  salvation, &quot;  continues  the  voice.  &quot;Thou <br/>hast  hated  me,  but  through  the  ages  yet  to  be  thou  shalt  bless  me,  for  I  have  led  thee  our  of  the  sphere <br/>of  the  Demiurgus;  I  have  turned  thee  against  the  illusion  of  worldliness;  I  have  weaned  thee  of  desire; <br/>I  have  awakened  in  thy  soul  the  immortality  of  which  I  myself  partake.  Follow  me,  O  Adam,  for  I  am <br/>the  Way,  the  Life,  and  the  Truth!&quot; <br/><br/><br/>p.  129 <br/><br/><br/>An  Analysis  of  Tarot  Cards <br/><br/>OPINIONS  of  authorities  differ  widely  concerning  the  origin  of  playing  cards,  the  purpose  for  which <br/>they  were  intended,  and  the  time  of  their  introduction  into  Europe.  In  his  Researches  into  the  History <br/>of  Playing  Cards,  Samuel  Waller  Singer  advances  the  opinion  that  cards  reached  Southern  Europe <br/>from  India  by  way  of  Arabia.  It  is  probable  that  the  Tarot  cards  were  part  of  the  magical  and <br/>philosophical  lore  secured  by  the  Knights  Templars  from  the  Saracens  or  one  of  the  mystical  sects <br/>then  flourishing  in  Syria.  Returning  to  Europe,  the  Templars,  to  avoid  persecution,  concealed  the <br/>arcane  meaning  of  the  symbols  by  introducing  the  leaves  of  their  magical  book  ostensibly  as  a  device <br/>for  amusement  and  gambling.  In  support  of  this  contention,  Mrs.  John  King  Van  Rensselaer  states: <br/><br/>&quot;That  cards  were  brought  by  the  home-returning  warriors,  who  imported  many  of  the  newly  acquired <br/>customs  and  habits  of  the  Orient  to  their  own  countries,  seems  to  be  a  well-established  fact;  and  it <br/>does  not  contradict  the  statement  made  by  some  writers  who  declared  that  the  gypsies&#x2014;who  about <br/>that  time  began  to  wander  over  Europe&#x2014;brought  with  them  and  introduced  cards,  which  they  used,  as <br/>they  do  at  the  present  day,  for  divining  the  future.&quot;  (See  The  Devil's  Picture  Books.) <br/><br/>Through  the  Gypsies  the  Tarot  cards  may  be  traced  back  to  the  religious  symbolism  of  the  ancient <br/>Egyptians.  In  his  remarkable  work.  The  Gypsies,  Samuel  Roberts  presents  ample  proof  of  their <br/>Egyptian  origin.  In  one  place  he  writes:  &quot;When  Gypsies  originally  arrived  in  England  is  very  uncertain. <br/>They  are  first  noticed  in  our  laws,  by  several  statutes  against  them  in  the  reign  of  Henry  VIII.;  in <br/>which  they  are  described  as  'an  outlandish  people,  calling  themselves  Egyptians,&#x2014; who  do  not  profess <br/>any  craft  or  trade,  but  go  about  in  great  numbers,  *  *  *.'&quot;  A  curious  legend  relates  that  after  the <br/>destruction  of  the  Serapeum  in  Alexandria,  the  large  body  of  attendant  priests  banded  themselves <br/>together  to  preserve  the  secrets  of  the  rites  of  Serapis.  Their  descendants  (Gypsies)  carrying  with <br/>them  the  most  precious  of  the  volumes  saved  from  the  burning  library&#x2014; the  Book  of  Enoch,  or  Thoth <br/>(the  Tarot)&#x2014; became  wanderers  upon  the  face  of  the  earth,  remaining  a  people  apart  with  an  ancient <br/>language  and  a  birthright  of  magic  and  mystery. <br/><br/>Court  de  Gebelin  believed  the  word  Tarot  itself  to  be  derived  from  two  Egyptian  words.  Tar,  meaning <br/>&quot;road,&quot;  and  Ro,  meaning  &quot;royal.&quot;  Thus  the  Tarot  constitutes  the  royal  road  to  wisdom.  (See  Le <br/>Monde  Primitif.)  In  his  History  of  Magic,  P.  Christian,  the  mouthpiece  of  a  certain  French  secret <br/>society,  presents  a  fantastic  account  of  a  purported  initiation  into  the  Egyptian  Mysteries  wherein  the <br/>22  major  Tarots  assume  the  proportions  of  trestleboards  of  immense  size  and  line  a  great  gallery. <br/>Stopping  before  each  card  in  turn,  the  initiator  described  its  symbolism  to  the  candidate.  Edouard <br/>Schure,  whose  source  of  information  was  similar  to  that  of  Christian's,  hints  at  the  same  ceremony  in <br/>his  chapter  on  initiation  into  the  Hermetic  Mysteries.  (See  The  Great  Initiates.)  While  the  Egyptians <br/>may  well  have  employed  the  Tarot  cards  in  their  rituals,  these  French  mystics  present  no  evidence <br/>other  than  their  own  assertions  to  support  this  theory.  The  validity  also  of  the  so-called  Egyptian <br/>Tarots  now  in  circulation  has  never  been  satisfactorily  established.  The  drawings  are  not  only  quite <br/>modem  but  the  symbolism  itself  savors  of  French  rather  than  Egyptian  influence. <br/><br/>The  Tarot  is  undoubtedly  a  vital  element  in  Rosicrucian  symbolism,  possibly  the  very  book  of <br/>universal  knowledge  which  the  members  of  the  order  claimed  to  possess.  The  Rota  Mundi  is  a  term <br/>frequently  occurring  in  the  early  manifestoes  of  the  Fraternity  of  the  Rose  Cross.  The  word  Rota  by  a <br/>rearrangement  of  its  letters  becomes  Taro,  the  ancient  name  of  these  mysterious  cards.  W.  F.  C. <br/>Wigston  has  discovered  evidence  that  Sir  Francis  Bacon  employed  the  Tarot  symbolism  in  his  ciphers. <br/>The  numbers  21,  56,  and  78,  which  are  all  directly  related  to  the  divisions  of  the  Tarot  deck,  are <br/>frequently  involved  in  Bacon's  cryptograms.  In  the  great  Shakespearian  Folio  of  1623  the  Christian <br/>name  of  Lord  Bacon  appears  21  times  on  page  56  of  the  Histories.  (See  The  Columbus  of  Literature.) <br/><br/><br/>Many  symbols  appearing  upon  the  Tarot  cards  have  definite  Masonic  interest.  The  Pythagorean <br/>numerologist  will  also  find  an  important  relationship  to  exist  between  the  numbers  on  the  cards  and <br/>the  designs  accompanying  the  numbers.  The  Qabbalist  will  be  immediately  impressed  by  the <br/>significant  sequence  of  the  cards,  and  the  alchemist  will  discover  certain  emblems  meaningless  save <br/>to  one  versed  in  the  divine  chemistry  of  transmutation  and  regeneration.'  As  the  Greeks  placed  the <br/>letters  of  their  alphabet &#x2014;with  their  corresponding  numbers&#x2014;upon  the  various  parts  of  the  body  of <br/>their  humanly  represented  Logos,  so  the  Tarot  cards  have  an  analogy  not  only  in  the  parts  and <br/>members  of  the  universe  but  also  in  the  divisions  of  the  human  body..  They  are  in  fact  the  key  to  the <br/>magical  constitution  of  man. <br/><br/>The  Tarot  cards  must  be  considered  (i)  as  separate  and  complete  hieroglyphs,  each  representing  a <br/>distinct  principle,  law,  power,  or  element  in  Nature;  (2)  in  relation  to  each  other  as  the  effect  of  one <br/>agent  operating  upon  another;  and  (3)  as  vowels  and  consonants  of  a  philosophic  alphabet.  The  laws <br/>governing  all  phenomena  are  represented  by  the  symbols  upon  the  Tarot  cards,  whose  numerical <br/>values  are  equal  to  the  numerical  equivalents  of  the  phenomena.  As  every  structure  consists  of  certain <br/>elemental  parts,  so  the  Tarot  cards  represent  the  components  of  the  structure  of  philosophy. <br/>Irrespective  of  the  science  or  philosophy  with  which  the  student  is  working,  the  Tarot  cards  can  be <br/>identified  with  the  essential  constituents  of  his  subject,  each  card  thus  being  related  to  a  specific  part <br/>according  to  mathematical  and  philosophical  laws.  &quot;An  imprisoned  person,&quot;  writes  Eliphas  Levi, <br/>&quot;with  no  other  book  than  the  Tarot,  if  he  knew  how  to  use  it,  could  in  a  few  years  acquire  universal <br/>knowledge,  and  would  be  able  to  speak  on  all  subjects  with  unequalled  learning  and  inexhaustible <br/>eloquence. &quot;  (See  Transcendental  Magic.) <br/><br/>The  diverse  opinions  of  eminent  authorities  on  the  Tarot  symbolism  are  quite  irreconcilable.  The <br/>conclusions  of  the  scholarly  Court  de  Gebelin  and  the  bizarre  Grand  Etteila~the  first  authorities  on <br/>the  subject&#x2014;not  only  are  at  radical  variance  but  both  are  equally  discredited  by  Levi,  whose <br/>arrangement  of  the  Tarot  trumps  was  rejected  in  turn  by  Arthur  Edward  Waite  and  Paul  Case  as <br/>being  an  effort  to  mislead  students.  The  followers  of  Levi&#x2014;especially  Papus,  Christian,  Westcott,  and <br/>Schure-are  regarded  by  the  &quot;reformed  Tarotists&quot;  as  honest  but  benighted  individuals  who  wandered <br/>in  darkness  for  lack  of  Pamela  Coleman  Smith's  new  deck  of  Tarot  cards  with  revisions  by  Mr.  Waite. <br/><br/>Most  writers  on  the  Tarot  (Mr.  Waite  a  notable  exception)  have  proceeded  upon  the  hypothesis  that <br/>the  22  major  trumps  represent  the  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet.  This  supposition  is  based  upon <br/>nothing  more  substantial  than  the  coincidence  that  both  consist  of  22  parts.  That  Postel,  St.  Martin, <br/>and  Levi  all  wrote  books  divided  into  sections  corresponding  to  the  major  Tarots  is  an  interesting <br/>sidelight  on  the  subject.  The  major  trump  cards  portray  incidents  from  the  Book  of  Revelation;  and <br/>the  Apocalypse  of  St.  John  is  also  divided  into  22  chapters.  Assuming  the  Qabbalah  to  hold  the <br/>solution  to  the  Tarot  riddle,  seekers  have  often  ignored  other  possible  lines  of  research.  The  task, <br/>however,  of  discovering  the  proper  relationship  sustained  by  the  Tarot  trumps  to  the  letters  of  the <br/>Hebrew  alphabet  and  the  Paths  of  Wisdom  thus  far  has  not  met  with  any  great <br/><br/><br/>EARLY  PORTUGUESE  CARDS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Chatto's  Origin  and  History  of  Playing  Cards. <br/><br/>In  writing  of  the  deck  from  which  the  four  cavahers  (jacks)  here  reproduced  were  taken,  Wilham  Andrew  Chatto  notes: <br/>&quot;Some  of  the  specimens  of  Portuguese  cards  given  in  the  'Jeux  de  Cartes,  Tarots  et  de  Cartes  Numerales'  have  very  much <br/>the  appearance  of  having  been  originally  suggested  by,  if  net  copied  from,  an  Oriental  type;  more  especially  in  the  suits  of <br/>Danari  and  Bastani,~Money  and  Clubs.  In  those  cards  the  circular  figure,  generally  understood  as  representing  Danari,  or <br/>Money,  is  certainly  much  more  like  the  Chakra,  or  quoit  of  Vichnou  [Vishnu],  as  seen  in  Hindostanic  drawings,  than  a <br/>piece  of  coin;  while  on  the  top  of  the  Club  is  a  diamond  proper,  which  is  another  of  the  attributes  of  the  same  deity.&quot;  Also <br/>worthy  of  note  are  the  Rosicrucian  and  Masonic  emblems  appearing  on  various  mediaeval  decks.  As  the  secrets  of  these <br/>organizations  were  often  concealed  in  cryptic  engravings,  it  is  very  probable  that  the  enigmatic  diagrams  upon  various <br/>decks  of  cards  were  used  both  to  conceal  and  to  perpetuate  the  political  and  philosophical  arcana  of  these  orders.  The <br/>frontispiece  of  Mr.  Chatto's  books  shows  a  knave  of  hearts  bearing  a  shield  emblazoned  with  a  crowned  Rosicrucian  rose. <br/><br/>p.  130 <br/><br/>measure  of  success.  The  major  trumps  of  the  Tarot  and  the  22  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet  cannot <br/>be  synchronized  without  first  fixing  the  correct  place  of  the  unnumbered,  or  zero,  card~Le  Mat,  the <br/>Fool.  Levi  places  this  card  between  the  20th  and  21st  Tarots,  assigning  to  it  the  Hebrew  letter  Shin  (jn). <br/>The  same  order  is  followed  by  Papus,  Christian,  and  Waite,  the  last,  however,  declaring  this <br/>arrangement  to  be  incorrect.  Westcott  makes  the  zero  card  the  22nd  of  the  Tarot  major  trumps.  On <br/>the  other  hand,  both  Court  de  Gebelin  and  Paul  Case  place  the  unnumbered  card  before  the  first <br/>numbered  card  of  the  major  trumps,  for  if  the  natural  order  of  the  numbers  (according  to  either  the <br/>Pythagorean  or  Qabbalistic  system)  be  adhered  to,  the  zero  card  must  naturally  precede  the  number  1. <br/><br/>This  does  not  dispose  of  the  problem,  however,  for  efforts  to  assign  a  Hebrew  letter  to  each  Tarot <br/>trump  in  sequence  produce  an  effect  far  from  convincing.  Mr.  Waite,  who  reedited  the  Tarot, <br/>expresses  himself  thus:  &quot;I  am  not  to  be  included  among  those  who  are  satisfied  that  there  is  a  valid <br/>correspondence  between  Hebrew  letters  and  Tarot  Trump  symbols.&quot;  (See  introduction  to  The  Book  of <br/><br/><br/>Formation  by  Knut  Stenring.)  The  real  explanation  maybe  that  the  major  Tarots  no  longer  are  in  the <br/><br/>same  sequence  as  when  they  formed  the  leaves  of  Hermes'  sacred  book,  for  the  Egyptians&#x2014;or  even <br/>their  Arabian  successors&#x2014;could  have  purposely  confused  the  cards  so  that  their  secrets  might  be <br/>better  preserved.  Mr.  Case  has  developed  a  system  which,  while  superior  to  most,  depends  largely <br/>upon  two  debatable  points,  namely,  the  accuracy  of  Mr.  Waite's  revised  Tarot  and  the  justification  for <br/>assigning  the  first  letter  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet  to  the  unnumbered,  or  zero,  card.  Since  Aleph  (the <br/>first  Hebrew  letter)  has  the  numerical  value  of  i,  its  assignment  to  the  zero  card  is  equivalent  to  the <br/>statement  that  zero  is  equal  to  the  letter  A/ep/i  and  therefore  synonymous  with  the  number  i. <br/><br/>With  rare  insight,  Court  de  Gebelin  assigned  the  zero  card  to  AIN  SOPH,  the  Unknowable  First  Cause. <br/>As  the  central  panel  of  the  Bembine  Table  represents  the  Creative  Power  surrounded  by  seven  triads <br/>of  manifesting  divinities,  so  may  the  zero  card  represent  that  Eternal  Power  of  which  the  21 <br/>surrounding  or  manifesting  aspects  are  but  limited  expressions.  If  the  21  major  trumps  be  considered <br/>as  limited  forms  existing  in  the  abstract  substance  of  the  zero  card,  it  then  becomes  their  common <br/>denominator.  Which  letter,  then,  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet  is  the  origin  of  all  the  remaining  letters?  The <br/>answer  is  apparent:  Yod.  In  the  presence  of  so  many  speculations,  one  more  may  not  offend.  The  zero <br/>card~Le  Mat,  the  Fool&#x2014;has  been  likened  to  the  material  universe  because  the  mortal  sphere  is  the <br/>world  of  unreality.  The  lower  universe,  like  the  mortal  body  of  man,  is  but  a  garment,  a  motley <br/>costume,  well  likened  to  cap  and  bells.  Beneath  the  garments  of  the  fool  is  the  divine  substance, <br/>however,  of  which  the  jester  is  but  a  shadow;  this  world  is  a  Mardi  Gras&#x2014; a  pageantry  of  divine  sparks <br/>masked  in  the  garb  of  fools.  Was  not  this  zero  card  (the  Fool)  placed  in  the  Tarot  deck  to  deceive  all <br/>who  could  not  pierce  the  veil  of  illusion? <br/><br/>The  Tarot  cards  were  entrusted  by  the  illumined  hierophants  of  the  Mysteries  into  the  keeping  of  the <br/>foolish  and  the  ignorant,  thus  becoming  playthings&#x2014; in  many  instances  even  instruments  of  vice. <br/>Man's  evil  habits  therefore  actually  became  the  unconscious  perpetuators  of  his  philosophical <br/>precepts.  &quot;We  must  admire  the  wisdom  of  the  Initiates,&quot;  writes  Papus,  &quot;who  utilized  vice  and  made  it <br/>produce  more  beneficial  results  than  virtue.&quot;  Does  not  this  act  of  the  ancient  priests  itself  afford  proof <br/>that  the  entire  mystery  of  the  Tarot  is  wrapped  up  in  the  symbolism  of  its  zero  card?  If  knowledge  was <br/>thus  entrusted  to  fools,  should  it  not  be  sought  for  in  this  card? <br/><br/>If  Le  Mat  be  placed  before  the  first  card  of  the  Tarot  deck  and  the  others  laid  out  in  a  horizontal  line <br/>in  sequence  from  left  to  right,  it  will  be  found  that  the  Fool  is  walking  toward  the  other  trumps  as <br/>though  about  to  pass  through  the  various  cards.  Like  the  spiritually  hoodwinked  and  bound  neophyte, <br/>Le  Mat  is  about  to  enter  upon  the  supreme  adventure&#x2014; that  of  passage  through  the  gates  of  the  Divine <br/>Wisdom.  If  the  zero  card  be  considered  as  extraneous  to  the  major  trumps,  this  destroys  the <br/>numerical  analogy  between  these  cards  and  the  Hebrew  letters  by  leaving  one  letter  without  a  Tarot <br/>correspondent.  In  this  event  it  will  be  necessary  to  assign  the  missing  letter  to  a  hypothetical  Tarot <br/>card  called  the  elements,  assumed  to  have  been  broken  up  to  form  the  56  cards  of  the  minor  trumps. <br/>It  is  possible  that  each  of  the  major  trumps  may  be  subject  to  a  similar  division. <br/><br/>The  first  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Bateleur,  the  juggler,  and  according  to  Court  de  Gebelin, <br/>indicates  the  entire  fabric  of  creation  to  be  but  a  dream,  existence  a  juggling  of  divine  elements,  and <br/>life  a  perpetual  game  of  hazard.  The  seeming  miracles  of  Nature  are  but  feats  of  cosmic  legerdemain. <br/>Man  is  like  the  little  ball  in  the  hands  of  the  juggler,  who  waves  his  wand  and,  presto!  the  ball <br/>vanishes.  The  world  looking  on  does  not  realize  that  the  vanished  article  is  still  cleverly  concealed  by <br/>the  juggler  in  the  hollow  of  his  hand.  This  is  also  the  Adept  whom  Omar  Khayyam  calls  &quot;the  master  of <br/>the  show.&quot;  His  message  is  that  the  wise  direct  the  phenomena  of  Nature  and  are  never  deceived <br/>thereby. <br/><br/>The  magician  stands  behind  a  table  on  which  are  spread  out  a  number  of  objects,  prominent  among <br/>them  a  cup&#x2014; the  Holy  Grail  and  the  cup  placed  by  Joseph  in  Benjamin's  sack;  a  coin&#x2014; the  tribute <br/>money  and  the  wages  of  a  Master  Builder,  and  a  sword,  that  of  Goliath  and  also  the  mystic  blade  of <br/><br/><br/>the  philosopher  which  divides  the  false  from  the  true.  The  magician's  hat  is  in  the  form  of  the  cosmic <br/>lemniscate,  signifying  the  first  motion  of  creation.  His  right  hand  points  to  the  earth,  his  left  holds <br/>aloft  the  rod  of  Jacob  and  also  the  staff  that  budded&#x2014;the  human  spine  crowned  with  the  globe  of <br/>creative  intelligence.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  magician  wears  an  urseus  or  golden  band <br/>around  his  forehead,  the  table  before  him  is  in  the  form  of  a  perfect  cube,  and  his  girdle  is  the  serpent <br/>of  eternity  devouring  its  own  tail. <br/><br/>The  second  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Papesse,  the  Female  Pope,  and  has  been  associated <br/>with  a  curious  legend  of  the  only  woman  who  ever  sat  in  the  pontifical  chair.  Pope  Joan  is  supposed  to <br/>have  accomplished  this  by  masquerading  in  malt  attire,  and  was  stoned  to  death  when  her  subterfuge <br/>was  discovered.  This  card  portrays  a  seated  woman  crowned  with  a  tiara  surmounted  by  a  lunar <br/>crescent.  In  her  lap  is  the  Tora,  or  book  of  the  Law  (usually  partly  closed),  and  in  her  left  hand  are  the <br/>keys  to  the  secret  doctrine,  one  gold  and  the  other  silver.  Behind  her  rise  two  pillars  (Jachin  and  Boaz) <br/>with  a  multicolored  veil  stretched  between.  Her  throne  stands  upon  a  checker-hoard  floor.  A  figure <br/>called  Juno  is  occasionally  substituted  for  La  Papesse.  like  the  female  hierophant  of  the  Mysteries  of <br/>Cybele,  this  symbolic  figure  personifies  the  Shekinah,  or  Divine  Wisdom.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian <br/>Tarot  the  priestess  is  veiled,  a  reminder  that  the  full  countenance  truth  is  not  revealed  to  uninitiated <br/>man.  A  veil  also  covers  one-half  of  her  book,  thus  intimating  that  but  one-half  of  the  mystery  of  being <br/>can  be  comprehended. <br/><br/>The  third  numbered  major  trump  is  called  L'Imperatrice,  the  Empress,  and  has  been  likened  to  the <br/>&quot;woman  clothed  with  the  sun&quot;  described  in  the  Apocalypse.  On  this  card  appears  the  winged  figure  of <br/>a  woman  seated  upon  a  throne,  supporting  with  her  right  hand  a  shield  emblazoned  with  a  phoenix <br/>and  holding  in  her  left  a  scepter  surmounted  by  an  orb  or  trifoliate  flower.  Beneath  her  left  foot  is <br/>sometimes  shown  the  crescent.  Either  the  Empress  is  crowned  or  her  head  is  surrounded  by  a  diadem <br/>of  stars;  sometimes  both.  She  is  called  Generation,  and  represents  the  threefold  spiritual  world  out  of <br/>which  proceeds  the  fourfold  material  world.  To  the  graduate  of  the  College  of  the  Mysteries  she  is  the <br/>Alma  Mater  out  of  whose  body  the  initiate  has  &quot;born  again.&quot;  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the <br/>Empress  is  shown  seated  upon  a  cube  filled  with  eyes  and  a  bird  is  balanced  upon  the  forefinger  other <br/>left  hand.  The  upper  part  of  her  body  is  surrounded  by  a  radiant  golden  nimbus.  Being  emblematic  of <br/>the  power  from  which  emanates  the  entire  tangible  universe,  L'Imperatrice  is  frequently  symbolized <br/>as  pregnant. <br/><br/>The  fourth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  L'Empereur,  the  Emperor,  and  by  its  numerical  value  is <br/>directly  associated  with  the  great  Deity  revered  by  the  Pythagoreans  under  the  form  of  the  tetrad.  His <br/>symbols  declare  the  Emperor  to  be  the  Demiurgus,  the  Great  King  of  the  inferior  world.  The  Emperor <br/>is  dressed  in  armor  and  his  throne  is  a  cube  stone,  upon  which  a  phoenix  is  also  clearly  visible.  The <br/>king  has  his  legs  crossed  in  a  most  significant  manner  and  carries  either  a  scepter  surmounted  by  an <br/>orb  or  a  scepter  in  his  right  hand  and  an  orb  n  his  left.  The  orb  itself  is  evidence  that  he  is  supreme <br/>ruler  of  the  world.  Upon  his  right  and  left  breasts  respectively  appear  the  symbols  of  the  sun  and <br/>moon,  which  in  symbolism  are  referred  to  as  the  eyes  of  the  Great  King.  The  position  of  the  body  and <br/>legs  forms  the  symbol  of  sulphur,  the  sign  of  the  ancient  alchemical  monarch.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian <br/>Tarot  the  figure  is  in  profile.  He  wears  a  Masonic  apron  and  the  skirt  forms  s  right-angled  triangle. <br/>Upon  his  head  is  the  Crown  of  the  North  and  his  forehead  is  adorned  wit  the  coiled  urseus. <br/><br/>The  fifth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Pape,  the  Pope,  and  represents  the  high  priest  of  a <br/>pagan  or  Christian  Mystery  school.  In  this  card  the  hierophant  wears  the  tiara  and  carries  in  his  left <br/>hand  the  triple  cross  surmounting  the  globe  of  the  world.  His  right  hand,  bearing  upon  its  back  the <br/>stigmata,  makes  &quot;the  ecclesiastic  sign  of  esotericism,&quot;  and  before  him  kneel  two  suppliants  or  acolytes. <br/>The  back  of  the  papal  throne  is  in  the  form  of  a  celestial  and  a  terrestrial  column.  This  card  signifies <br/>the  initiate  or  master  of  the  mystery  of  life  and  according  to  the  Pythagoreans,  the  spiritual  physician. <br/>The  illusionary  universe  in  the  form  of  the  two  figures  (polarity)  kneels  before  the  throne  upon  which <br/>sits  the  initiate  who  has  elevated  his  consciousness  to  the  plane  of  spiritual  understanding  and  reality. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  Master  wears  the  urseus.  A  white  and  a  black  figure~Hfe  and  death, <br/>light  and  darkness,  good  and  evil&#x2014;kneel  before  him.  The  initiate's  mastery  over  unreality  is  indicated <br/>by  the  tiara  and  the  triple  cross,  emblems  of  rulership  over  the  three  worlds  which  have  issued  from <br/>the  Unknowable  First  Cause. <br/><br/>The  sixth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  L'Amoureux,  the  Lovers.  There  are  two  distinct  forms  of <br/>this  Tarot.  One  shows  a  marriage  ceremony  in  which  a  priest  is  uniting  a  youth  and  a  maiden  (Adam <br/>and  Eve?)  in  holy  wedlock.  Sometimes  a  winged  figure  above  transfixes  the  lovers  with  his  dart.  The <br/>second  form  of  the  card  portrays  a  youth  with  a  female  figure  on  either  side.  One  of  these  figures <br/>wears  a  golden  crown  and  is  winged,  while  the  other  is  attired  in  the  flowing  robes  of  the  bacchante <br/>and  on  her  head  is  a  wreath  of  vine  leaves.  The  maidens  represent  the  twofold  soul  of  man  (spiritual <br/>and  animal),  the  first  his  guardian  angel  and  the  second  his  ever-present  demon.  The  youth  stands  at <br/>the  beginning  of  mature  life,  &quot;the  Parting  of  the  Ways,&quot;  where  he  must  choose  between  virtue  and  vice, <br/>the  eternal  and  the  temporal.  Above,  in  a  halo  of  light,  is  the  genius  of  Fate  (his  star),  mistaken  for <br/>Cupid  by  the  uninformed.  If  youth  chooses  unwisely,  the  arrow  of  blindfolded  Fate  will  transfix  him. <br/>In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  arrow  of  the  genius  points  directly  to  the  figure  of  vice,  thereby <br/>signifying  that  the  end  of  her  path  is  destruction.  This  card  reminds  man  that  the  price  of  free  will&#x2014;or, <br/>more  correctly,  the  power  of  choice&#x2014; is  responsibility. <br/><br/>The  seventh  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Chariot,  the  Chariot,  and  portrays  a  victorious <br/>warrior  crowned  and  riding  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  black  and  white  sphinxes  or  horses.  The  starry <br/>canopy  of  the  chariot  is  upheld  by  four  columns.  This  card  signifies  the  Exalted  One  who  rides  in  the <br/>chariot  of  creation.  The  vehicle  of  the  solar  energy  being  numbered  seven  reveals  the  arcane  truth  that <br/>the  seven  planers  are  the  chariots  of  the  solar  power  which  rides  victorious  in  their  midst.  The  four <br/>columns  supporting  the  canopy  represent  the  four  Mighty  Ones  who  uphold  the  worlds  represented <br/>by  the  star-strewn  drapery.  The  figure  carries  the  scepter  of  the  solar  energy  and  its  shoulders  are <br/>ornamented  with  lunar  crescents&#x2014; the  Urim.  and  Thummim.  The  sphinxes  drawing  the  chariot  resent <br/>the  secret  and  unknown  power  by  which  the  victorious  ruler  is  moved  continuously  through  the <br/>various  parts  of  his  universe.  In  certain  Tarot  decks  the  victor  signifies  the  regenerated  man,  for  the <br/>body  of  the  chariot  is  a  cubic  stone.  The  man  in  armor  is  not  standing  in  the  chariot  but  is  rising  out <br/>of  the  cube,  thus  typifying  the  ascension  of  the  3  out  of  the  4&#x2014; the  turning  upward  of  the  flap  of  the <br/>Master  Mason's  apron.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  warrior  carries  the  curved  sword  of  Luna,  is <br/>bearded  to  signify  maturity,  and  wears  the  collar  of  the  planetary  orbits.  His  scepter  (emblematic  of <br/>the  threefold  universe)  is  crowned  with  a  square  upon  which  is  a  circle  surmounted  by  a  triangle. <br/><br/>p- 131 <br/><br/>The  eighth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Justice,  Justice,  and  portrays  a  seated  figure  upon  a <br/>throne,  the  back  of  which  rises  in  the  form  of  two  columns.  Justice  is  crowned  and  carries  in  her  right <br/>hand  a  sword  and  in  her  left  a  pair  of  scales.  This  card  is  a  reminder  of  the  judgment  of  the  soul  in  the <br/>hall  of  Osiris.  It  teaches  that  only  balanced  forces  can  endure  and  that  eternal  justice  destroys  with <br/>the  sword  that  which  is  unbalanced.  Sometimes  justice  is  depicted  with  a  braid  of  her  own  hair <br/>twisted  around  her  neck  in  a  manner  resembling  a  hangman's  knot.  This  may  subtly  imply  that  man <br/>is  the  cause  of  his  own  undoing,  his  actions  (symbolized  by  his  hair)  being  the  instrument  of  his <br/>annihilation.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  figure  of  Justice  is  raised  upon  a  dais  of  three  steps, <br/>for  justice  can  be  fully  administered  only  by  such  as  have  been  elevated  to  the  third  degree.  Justice  is <br/>blindfolded,  that  the  visible  shall  in  no  way  influence  its  decision.  (For  reasons  he  considers  beyond <br/>his  readers'  intelligence,  Mr.  Waite  reversed  the  eighth  and  eleventh  major  trumps.) <br/><br/>The  ninth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  L'Hermite,  the  Hermit,  and  portrays  an  aged  man,  robed <br/>in  a  monkish  habit  and  cowl,  leaning  on  a  staff.  This  card  was  popularly  supposed  to  represent <br/>Diogenes  in  his  quest  for  an  honest  man.  In  his  right  hand  the  recluse  carries  a  lamp  which  he  partly <br/>conceals  within  the  folds  of  his  cape.  The  hermit  thereby  personifies  the  secret  organizations  which <br/><br/><br/>for  uncounted  centuries  have  carefully  concealed  the  light  of  the  Ancient  Wisdom  from  the  profane. <br/><br/>The  staff  of  the  hermit  is  knowledge,  which  is  man's  main  and  only  enduring  support.  Sometimes  the <br/>mystic  rod  is  divided  by  knobs  into  seven  sections,  a  subtle  reference  to  the  mystery  of  the  seven <br/>sacred  centers  along  the  human  spine.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  hermit  shields  the  lamp <br/>behind  a  rectangular  cape  to  emphasize  the  philosophic  truth  that  wisdom,  if  exposed  to  the  fury  of <br/>ignorance,  would  be  destroyed  like  the  tiny  flame  of  a  lamp  unprotected  from  the  storm.  Man's  bodies <br/>form  a  cloak  through  which  his  divine  nature  is  faintly  visible  like  the  flame  of  the  partly  covered <br/>lantern.  Through  renunciation&#x2014;the  Hermetic  life&#x2014;man  attains  depth  of  character  and  tranquility  of <br/>spirit. <br/><br/>The  tenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Roue  de  Fortune,  the  Wheel  of  Fortune,  and  portrays  a <br/>mysterious  wheel  with  eight  spokes&#x2014; the  familiar  Buddhist  symbol  of  the  Cycle  of  Necessity.  To  its  rim <br/>cling  Anubis  and  Typhon&#x2014; the  principles  of  good  and  evil.  Above  sits  the  immobile  sphinx,  carrying <br/>the  sword  of  Justice  and  signifying  the  perfect  equilibrium  of  Universal  Wisdom.  Anubis  is  shown <br/>rising  and  Typhon  descending;  but  when  Typhon  reaches  the  bottom,  evil  ascends  again,  and  when <br/>Anubis  reaches  the  top  good  wanes  once  more.  The  Wheel  of  Fortune  represents  the  lower  universe  as <br/>a  whole  with  Divine  Wisdom  (the  sphinx)  as  the  eternal  arbiter  between  good  and  evil.  In  India,  the <br/>chakra,  or  wheel,  is  associated  with  the  life  centers  either  of  a  world  or  of  an  individual.  In  the <br/>pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  Sphinx  is  armed  with  a  javelin,  and  Typhon  is  being  thrown  from  the <br/>wheel.  The  vertical  columns,  supporting  the  wheel  and  so  placed  that  but  one  is  visible,  represent  the <br/>axis  of  the  world  with  the  inscrutable  sphinx  upon  its  northern  pole.  Sometimes  the  wheel  with  its <br/>supports  is  in  a  boat  upon  the  water.  The  water  is  the  Ocean  of  Illusion,  which  is  the  sole  foundation <br/>of  the  Cycle  of  Necessity. <br/><br/>The  eleventh  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Force,  Strength,  and  portrays  a  girl  wearing  a  hat  in <br/>the  form  of  a  lemniscate,  with  her  hands  upon  the  mouth  of  an  apparently  ferocious  lion. <br/>Considerable  controversy  exists  as  to  whether  the  maid  is  dosing  or  opening  the  lion's  mouth.  Most <br/>writers  declare  her  to  be  closing  the  jaws  of  the  beast,  but  a  critical  inspection  conveys  the  opposite <br/>impression.  The  young  woman  symbolizes  spiritual  strength  and  the  lion  either  the  animal  world <br/>which  the  girl  is  mastering  or  the  Secret  Wisdom  over  which  she  is  mistress.  The  lion  also  signifies  the <br/>summer  solstice  and  the  girl,  Virgo,  for  when  the  sun  enters  this  constellation,  the  Virgin  robs  the  lion <br/>of  his  strength.  King  Solomon's  throne  was  ornamented  with  lions  and  he  himself  was  likened  to  the <br/>king  of  beasts  with  the  key  of  wisdom  between  its  teeth.  In  this  sense,  the  girl  may  be  opening  the <br/>lion's  mouth  to  find  the  key  contained  therein  for  courage  is  a  prerequisite  to  the  attainment  of <br/>knowledge.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  symbolism  is  the  same  except  that  the  maiden  is <br/>represented  as  a  priestess  wearing  an  elaborate  crown  in  the  form  of  a  bird  surmounted  by  serpents <br/>and  an  ibis. <br/><br/>The  twelfth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Pendu,  the  Hanged  Man,  an  portrays  a  young  man <br/>hanging  by  his  left  leg  from  a  horizontal  beam,  the  latter  supported  by  two  tree  trunks  from  each  of <br/>which  six  branches  have  been  removed.  The  right  leg  of  the  youth  is  crossed  in  back  of  the  left  and  his <br/>arms  are  folded  behind  his  back  in  such  a  way  as  to  form  a  cross  surmounting  a  downward  pointing <br/>triangle.  The  figure  thus  forms  an  inverted  symbol  of  sulphur  and,  according  to  Levi,  signifies  the <br/>accomplishment  of  the  magnum  opus.  In  some  decks  the  figure  carries  under  each  arm  a  moneybag <br/>from  which  coins  are  escaping.  Popular  tradition  associates  this  card  with  Judas  Iscariot,  who  is  said <br/>to  have  gone  forth  and  hanged  himself,  the  money  bags  representing  the  payment  he  received  for  his <br/>crime. <br/><br/>Levi  likens  the  hanged  man  to  Prometheus,  the  Eternal  Sufferer,  further  declaring  that  the  upturned <br/>feet  signify  the  spiritualization  of  the  lower  nature.  It  is  also  possible  that  the  inverted  figure  denotes <br/>the  loss  of  the  spiritual  faculties,  for  the  head  is  below  the  level  of  the  body.  The  stumps  of  the  twelve <br/>branches  are  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  divided  into  two  groups&#x2014; positive  and  negative.  The  picture <br/>therefore  depicts  polarity  temporarily  triumphant  over  the  spiritual  principle  of  equilibrium.  To <br/><br/><br/>attain  the  heights  of  philosophy,  therefore,  man  must  reverse  (or  invert)  the  order  of  his  Ufe.  He  then <br/><br/>loses  his  sense  of  personal  possession  because  he  renounces  the  rule  of  gold  in  favor  of  the  golden <br/>rule.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  hanged  man  is  suspended  between  two  palm  trees  and <br/>signifies  the  Sun  God  who  dies  perennially  for  his  world. <br/><br/>The  thirteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Mort,  Death,  and  portrays  a  reaping  skeleton  with <br/>a  great  scythe  cutting  off  the  heads,  hands,  and  feet  rising  out  of  the  earth  about  it.  In  the  course  of  its <br/>labors  the  skeleton  has  apparently  cut  off  one  of  its  own  feet.  Not  all  Tarot  decks  show  this  peculiarity, <br/>but  this  point  well  emphasizes  the  philosophic  truth  that  unbalance  and  destructiveness  are <br/>synonymous.  The  skeleton  is  the  proper  emblem  of  the  first  and  supreme  Deity  because  it  is  the <br/>foundation  of  the  body,  as  the  Absolute  is  the  foundation  of  creation.  The  reaping  skeleton  physically <br/>signifies  death  but  philosophically  that  irresistible  impulse  in  Nature  which  causes  every  being  to  be <br/>ultimately  absorbed  into  the  divine  condition  in  which  it  existed  before  the  illusionary  universe  had <br/>been  manifested.  The  blade  of  the  scythe  is  the  moon  with  its  crystallizing  power.  The  field  in  which <br/>death  reaps  is  the  universe,  and  the  card  discloses  that  all  things  growing  out  of  the  earth  shall  be  cut <br/>down  and  return  to  earth  again. <br/><br/>Kings,  Queens,  courtesans,  and  knaves  are  alike  to  death,  the  master  of  the  visible  and  a  parent  parts <br/>of  all  creatures.  In  some  Tarot  decks  death  is  symbolized  as  a  figure  in  armor  mounted  on  a  white <br/>horse  which  tramples  under  foot  old  and  young  alike.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  a  rainbow  is  seen <br/>behind  the  figure  of  death,  thus  signifying  that  the  mortality  of  the  body  of  itself  achieves  the <br/>immortality  of  the  spirit.  Death,  though  it  destroys  form,  can  never  destroy  life,  which  continually <br/>renews  itself.  This  card  is  the  symbol  of  the  constant  renovation  of  the  universe&#x2014;disintegration  that <br/>reintegration  may  follow  upon  a  higher  level  of  expression. <br/><br/>The  fourteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Temperance,  Temperance,  and  portrays  an <br/>angelic  figure  with  the  sun  upon  her  forehead.  She  carries  two  urns,  one  empty  and  the  other  full,  and <br/>continually  pours  the  contents  of  the  upper  into  the  lower.  In  some  Tarot  decks  the  flowing  water <br/>takes  the  form  of  the  symbol  of  Aquarius.  Not  one  drop,  however,  of  the  living  water  is  lost  in  this <br/>endless  transference  between  the  superior  vessel  and  the  inferior.  When  the  lower  urn  is  filled  the <br/>vases  are  reversed,  thus  signifying  that  life  pours  first  from  the  invisible  into  the  visible,  then  from  the <br/>visible  back  into  the  invisible.  The  spirit  controlling  this  flow  is  an  emissary  of  the  great  Jehovah, <br/>Demiurgus  of  the  world.  The  sun,  or  light  cluster,  upon  the  woman's  forehead  controls  the  flow  of <br/>water,  which,  being  drawn  upward  into  the  air  by  the  solar  rays,  descends  upon  the  earth  as  rain,  to <br/>drawn  up  and  fall  again  ad  infinitum.  Herein  is  also  shown  the  passage  of  the  human  life  forces  back <br/>and  forth  between  positive  and  negative  poles  of  the  creative  system.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot <br/>the  symbolism  is  the  same,  except  that  the  winged  figure  is  male  instead  of  female.  It  is  surrounded <br/>by  a  solar  nimbus  and  pours  water  from  a  golden  urn  into  a  silver  one,  typifying  the  descent  of <br/>celestial  forces  into  the  sublunary  spheres. <br/><br/>The  fifteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Diable,  the  Devil,  and  portrays  a  creature <br/>resembling  Pan  with  the  horns  of  a  ram  or  deer,  the  arms  and  body  of  a  man,  and  the  legs  and  feet  of <br/>a  goat  or  dragon.  The  figure  stands  upon  a  cubic  stone,  to  a  ring  in  the  front  of  which  are  chained  two <br/>satyrs.  For  a  scepter  this  so-called  demon  carries  a  lighted  torch  or  candle.  The  entire  figure  is <br/>symbolic  of  the  magic  powers  of  the  astral  light,  or  universal  mirror,  in  which  the  divine  forces  are <br/>reflected  in  an  inverted,  or  infernal,  state.  The  demon  is  winged  like  a  bar,  showing  that  it  pertains  to <br/>the  nocturnal,  or  shadow  inferior  sphere.  The  animal  natures  of  man,  in  the  form  of  a  male  and  a <br/>female  elemental,  are  chained  to  its  footstool.  The  torch  is  the  false  light  which  guides  unillumined <br/>souls  to  their  own  undoing.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  appears  Typhon~a  winged  creature <br/>composed  of  a  hog,  a  man,  a  bat,  a  crocodile,  and  a  hippopotamus&#x2014;standing  in  the  midst  of  its  own <br/>destructiveness  and  holding  aloft  the  firebrand  of  the  incendiary.  Typhon  is  created  by  man's  own <br/>misdeeds,  which,  turning  upon  their  maker,  destroy  him. <br/><br/><br/>The  sixteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Feu  du  del,  the  Fire  of  Heaven,  and  portrays  a <br/>tower  the  battlements  of  which,  in  the  form  of  a  crown,  are  being  destroyed  by  a  bolt  of  lightning <br/>issuing  from  the  sun.  The  crown,  being  considerably  smaller  than  the  tower  which  it  surmounts, <br/>possibly  indicates  that  its  destruction  resulted  from  its  insufficiency.  The  lighting  bolt  sometimes <br/>takes  the  form  of  the  zodiacal  sign  of  Scorpio,  and  the  tower  maybe  considered  a  phallic  emblem. <br/>Two  figures  are  failing  from  the  tower,  one  in  front  and  the  other  behind.  This  Tarot  card  is  popularly <br/>associated  with  the  traditional  fall  of  man.  The  divine  nature  of  humanity  is  depicted  as  a  tower. <br/>When  his  crown  is  destroyed,  man  falls  into  the  lower  world  and  takes  upon  himself  the  illusion  of <br/>materiality.  Here  also  is  a  key  to  the  mystery  of  sex.  The  tower  is  supposedly  filled  with  gold  coins <br/>which,  showering  out  in  great  numbers  from  the  rent  made  by  the  lightning  bolt,  suggesting  potential <br/>powers.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  tower  is  a  pyramid,  its  apex  shattered  by  a  lightning  bolt. <br/>Here  is  a  reference  to  the  missing  capstone  of  the  Universal  House.  In  support  of  Levi's  contention <br/>that  this  card  is  connected  with  the  Hebrew  letter  Ayin,  the  failing  figure  in  the  foreground  is  similar <br/>in  general  appearance  to  the  sixteenth  letter  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet. <br/><br/>The  seventeenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Les  Etoiles,  the  Stars,  and  portrays  a  young  girl <br/>kneeling  with  one  foot  in  water  and  the  other  on  and,  her  body  somewhat  suggesting  the  swastika. <br/>She  has  two  urns,  the  contents  of  which  she  pours  upon  the  land  and  sea.  Above  the  girl's  head  are <br/>eight  stars,  one  of  which  is  exceptionally  large  and  bright.  Count  de  Gebelin  considers  the  great  star  to <br/>be  Sothis  or  Sirius;  the  other  seven  are  the  sacred  planets  of  the  ancients.  He  believes  the  female <br/>figure  to  be  Isis  in  the  act  of  causing  the  inundations  of  the  Nile  which  accompanied  the  rising  of  the <br/>Dog  Star.  The  unclothed  figure  of  Isis  may  well  signify  that  Nature  does  not  receive  her  garment  of <br/>verdure  until  the  rising  of  the  Nile  waters  releases  the  germinal  life  of  plants  and  flowers.  The  bush <br/>and  bird  (or  butterfly)  signify  the  growth  and  resurrection  which  accompany  the  rising  of  the  waters. <br/>In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  great  star  contains  a  diamond  composed  of  a  black  and  white <br/>triangle,  and  the  flowering  bush  is  a  tall  plant  with  a  trifoliate  head  upon  which  a  butterfly  alights. <br/>Here  Isis  is  in  the  form  of  an  upright  triangle  and  the  vases  have  become  shallow  cups.  The  elements <br/>of  water  and  earth  under  her  feet  represent  the  opposites  of  Nature  sharing  impartially  in  the  divine <br/>abundance. <br/><br/>The  eighteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  La  Lune,  the  Moon,  and  portrays  Luna  rising <br/>between  two  towers&#x2014;one  light  and  the  other  dark.  A  dog  and  a  wolf  are  baying  at  the  rising  moon, <br/>and  in  the  foreground  is  a  pool  of  water  from  which  emerges  a  crawfish.  Between  the  towers  a  path <br/><br/><br/>A  CARD  FROM  THE  MANTEGNA  PACK. <br/><br/><br/>From  Taylor's  The  History  of  Playing  Cards. <br/><br/>Among  the  more  curious  examples  of  playing  cards  are  those  of  the  Mantegna  deck.  In  1820,  a  perfect  deck  of  fifty  cards <br/>brought  the  then  amazing  price  of  eighty  pounds.  The  fifty  subjects  composing  the  Mantegna  deck,  each  of  which  is <br/>represented  by  an  appropriate  figure,  are:  (1)  A  beggar;  (2)  A  page;  (3)  A  goldsmith;  (4)  A  merchant;  (5)  A  gentleman;  (6) <br/>A  knight;  (7)  The  Doge;  (8)  A  king;  (9)  An  emperor,  (10)  The  Pope;  (11)  Calliope;  (12)  Urania;  (13)  Terpsichore;  (14)  Erato; <br/>(15)  Polyhymnia;  (16)  Thalia;  (17)  Melpomene;  (18)  Euterpe;  (19)  Clio;  (20)  Apollo;  (21)  Grammar,  (22)  Logic;  (23) <br/>Rhetoric;  (24)  Geometry;  (25)  Arithmetic;  (26)  Music,  (27)  Poetry;  (28)  Philosophy;  (29)  Astrology;  (30)  Theology;  (31) <br/>Astronomy;  (32)  Chronology  (33)  Cosmogony;  (34)  Temperance;  (35)  Prudence;  (36)  Fortitude;  (37)  Justice;  (38)  Charity; <br/>(39)  Fortitude,  (40)  Faith;  (41)  the  Moon;  (42)  Mercury;  (43)  Venus;  (45)  the  Sun;  (45)  Mars;  (46)  Jupiter;  (47)  Saturn; <br/>(48)  the  eighth  Sphere;  (49)  the  Primum  Mobile;  (50)  the  First  Cause.  The  Qabbalistic  significance  of  these  cards  is <br/>apparent,  and  it  is  possible  that  they  have  a  direct  analogy  to  the  fifty  gates  of  light  referred  to  in  Qabbalistic  writings. <br/><br/>p.  132 <br/><br/>winds,  vanishing  in  the  extreme  background.  Court  de  GebeUn  sees  in  this  card  another  reference  to <br/>the  rising  of  the  Nile  and  states  on  the  authority  of  Pausanius  that  the  Egyptians  beheved  the <br/>inundations  of  the  Nile  to  result  from  the  tears  of  the  moon  goddess  which,  falling  into  the  river, <br/>swelled  its  flow.  These  tears  are  seen  dropping  from  the  lunar  face.  Court  de  Gebelin  also  relates  the <br/>towers  to  the  Pillars  of  Hercules,  beyond  which,  according  to  the  Egyptians,  the  luminaries  never <br/>passed.  He  notes  also  that  the  Egyptians  represented  the  tropics  as  dogs  who  as  faithful  doorkeepers <br/>prevented  the  sun  and  moon  from  penetrating  too  near  the  poles.  The  crab  or  crawfish  signifies  the <br/>retrograde  motion  of  the  moon. <br/><br/><br/>This  card  also  refers  to  the  path  of  wisdom.  Man  in  his  quest  of  reality  emerges  from  the  pool  of <br/>illusion.  After  mastering  the  guardians  of  the  gates  of  wisdom  he  passes  between  the  fortresses  of <br/>science  and  theology  and  follows  the  winding  path  leading  to  spiritual  liberation.  His  way  is  faintly <br/>lighted  by  human  reason  (the  moon),  which  is  but  a  reflection  of  divine  wisdom.  In  the  pseudo- <br/>Egyptian  Tarot  the  towers  are  pyramids,  the  dogs  are  black  and  white  respectively,  and  the  moon  is <br/>partly  obscured  by  clouds.  The  entire  scene  suggests  the  dreary  and  desolate  place  in  which  the <br/>Mystery  dramas  of  the  Lesser  Rites  were  enacted. <br/><br/>The  nineteenth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Soleil,  the  Sun,  and  portrays  two  children&#x2014; <br/>probably  Gemini,  the  Twins&#x2014; standing  together  in  a  garden  surrounded  by  a  magic  ring  of  flowers. <br/>One  of  these  children  should  be  shown  as  male  and  the  other  female.  Behind  them  is  a  brick  wall <br/>apparently  enclosing  the  garden.  Above  the  wall  the  sun  is  rising,  its  rays  alternately  straight  and <br/>curved.  Thirteen  teardrops  are  falling  from  the  solar  face  Levi,  seeing  in  the  two  children  Faith  and <br/>Reason,  which  must  coexist  as  long  as  the  temporal  universe  endures,  writes:  &quot;Human  equilibrium <br/>requires  two  feet,  the  worlds  gravitate  by  means  of  two  forces,  generation  needs  two  sexes.  Such  is  the <br/>meaning  of  the  arcanum  of  Solomon,  represented  by  the  two  pillars  of  the  temple,  Jakin  and  Bohas.&quot; <br/>(See  Transcendental  Magic.)  The  sun  of  Truth  is  shining  into  the  garden  of  the  world  over  which <br/>these  two  children,  as  personifications  of  eternal  powers  reside.  The  harmony  of  the  world  depends <br/>upon  the  coordination  of  two  qualities  symbolized  throughout  the  ages  as  the  mind  and  the  heart.  In <br/>the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  children  give  place  to  a  youth  and  a  maiden.  Above  them  in  a  solar <br/>nimbus  is  the  phallic  emblem  of  generation&#x2014;a  line  piercing  a  circle.  Gemini  is  ruled  by  Mercury  and <br/>the  two  children  personify  the  serpents  entwined  around  the  caduceus. <br/><br/>The  twentieth  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Jugement,  the  judgment,  and  portrays  three <br/>figures  rising  apparently  from  their  tombs,  though  but  one  coffin  is  visible.  Above  them  in  a  blaze  of <br/>glory  is  a  winged  figure  (presumably  the  Angel  Gabriel)  blowing  a  trumpet.  This  Tarot  represents  the <br/>liberation  of  man's  threefold  spiritual  nature  from  the  sepulcher  of  his  material  constitution.  Since <br/>but  one-third  of  the  spirit  actually  enters  the  physical  body,  the  other  two-thirds  constituting  the <br/>Hermetic  anthropos  or  overman,  only  one  of  the  three  figures  is  actually  rising  from  the  tomb.  Court <br/>de  Gebelin  believes  that  the  coffin  may  have  been  an  afterthought  of  the  card  makers  and  that  the <br/>scene  actually  represents  creation  rather  than  resurrection,  In  philosophy  these  two  words  are <br/>practically  synonymous.  The  blast  of  the  trumpet  represents  the  Creative  Word,  by  the  intoning  of <br/>which  man  is  liberated  from  his  terrestrial  limitations.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  it  is  evident  that <br/>the  three  figures  signify  the  parts  of  a  single  being,  for  three  mummies  are  shovm  emerging  from  one <br/>mummy  case. <br/><br/>The  twenty-first  numbered  major  trump  is  called  Le  Monde,  the  World,  and  portrays  a  female  figure <br/>draped  with  a  scarf  which  the  wind  blows  into  the  form  of  the  Hebrew  letter  Kaph.  Her  extended <br/>hands&#x2014;each  of  which  holds  a  wand&#x2014;and  her  left  leg,  which  crosses  behind  the  right,  cause  the  figure <br/>to  assume  the  form  of  the  alchemical  symbol  of  sulphur.  The  central  figure  is  surrounded  by  a  wreath <br/>in  the  form  of  a  vesica  piscis  which  Levi  likens  to  the  Qabbalistic  crown  Kether.  The  Cherubim  of <br/>Ezekiel's  vision  occupy  the  corners  of  the  card.  This  Tarot  is  called  the  Microcosm  and  the  Macrocosm <br/>because  in  it  are  summed  up  every  agency  contributing  to  the  structure  of  creation.  The  figure  in  the <br/>form  Of  the  emblem  of  sulphur  represents  the  divine  fire  and  the  heart  of  the  Great  Mystery.  The <br/>wreath  is  Nature,  which  surrounds  the  fiery  center.  The  Cherubim  represent  the  elements,  worlds, <br/>forces,  and  planes  issuing  out  of  the  divine  fiery  center  of  life.  The  wreath  signifies  the  crown  of  the <br/>initiate  which  is  given  to  those  who  master  the  four  guardians  and  enter  into  the  presence  of  unveiled <br/>Truth.  In  the  pseudo-Egyptian  Tarot  the  Cherubim  surround  a  wreath  composed  of  twelve  trifoliate <br/>flowers&#x2014; the  decanates  of  the  zodiac.  A  human  figure  kneels  below  this  wreath,  playing  upon  a  harp  of <br/>three  strings,  for  the  spirit  must  create  harmony  in  the  triple  constitution  of  its  inferior  nature  before <br/>it  can  gain  for  itself  the  solar  crown  of  immortality. <br/><br/><br/>The  four  suits  of  the  minor  trumps  are  considered  as  analogous  to  the  four  elements,  the  four  comers <br/>of  creation,  and  the  four  worlds  of  Qabbalism.  The  key  to  the  lesser  Tarots  is  presumably  the <br/>Tetragrammaton,  or  the  four-letter  name  of  Jehovah,  IHVH.  The  four  suits  of  the  minor  trumps <br/>represent  also  the  major  divisions  of  society:  cups  are  the  priesthood,  swords  the  military,  coins  the <br/>tradesmen,  and  rods  the  farming  class.  From  the  standpoint  of  what  Court  de  Gebelin  calls  &quot;political <br/>geography,&quot;  cups  represent  the  northern  countries,  swords  the  Orient,  coins  the  Occident,  and  rods <br/>the  southern  countries.  The  ten  pip  cards  of  each  suit  represent  the  nations  composing  each  of  these <br/>grand  divisions.  The  kings  are  their  governments,  the  queens  their  religions,  the  knights  their <br/>histories  and  national  characteristics,  and  the  pages  their  arts  and  sciences.  Elaborate  treatises  have <br/>been  written  concerning  the  use  of  the  Tarot  cards  in  divination,  but  as  this  practice  is  contrary  to  the <br/>primary  purpose  of  the  Tarot  no  profit  can  result  from  its  discussion. <br/><br/>Many  interesting  examples  of  early  playing  cards  are  found  in  the  museums  of  Europe,  and  there  are <br/>also  noteworthy  specimens  in  the  cabinets  of  various  private  collectors.  A  few  hand-painted  decks <br/>exist  which  are  extremely  artistic.  These  depict  various  important  personages  contemporary  with  the <br/>artists.  In  some  instances,  the  court  cards  are  portraitures  of  the  reigning  monarch  and  his  family.  In <br/>England  engraved  cards  became  popular,  and  in  the  British  Museum  are  also  to  be  seen  some <br/>extremely  quaint  stenciled  cards.  Heraldic  devices  were  employed;  and  Chatto,  in  his  Origin  and <br/>History  of  Playing  Cards,  reproduces  four  heraldic  cards  in  which  the  arms  of  Pope  Clement  IX <br/>adorn  the  king  of  clubs.  There  have  been  philosophical  decks  with  emblems  chosen  from  Greek  and <br/>Roman  mythology,  also  educational  decks  ornamented  with  maps  or  pictorial  representations  of <br/>famous  historic  places  and  incidents.  Many  rare  examples  of  playing-cards  have  been  found  bound <br/>into  the  covers  of  early  books.  In  Japan  there  are  card  games  the  successful  playing  of  which  requires <br/>familiarity  with  nearly  all  the  literary  masterpieces  of  that  nation.  In  India  there  are  circular  decks <br/>depicting  episodes  from  Oriental  myths.  There  are  also  cards  which  in  one  sense  of  the  word  are  not <br/>cards,  for  the  designs  are  on  wood,  ivory,  and  even  metal.  There  are  comic  cards  caricaturing  disliked <br/>persons  and  places,  and  there  are  cards  commemorating  various  human  achievements.  During  the <br/>American  Civil  War  a  patriotic  deck  was  circulated  in  which  stars,  eagles,  anchors,  and  American  flags <br/>were  substituted  for  the  suits  and  the  court  cards  were  famous  generals. <br/><br/>Modern  playing  cards  are  the  minor  trumps  of  the  Tarot,  from  each  suit  of  which  the  page,  or  valet, <br/>has  been  eliminated,  leaving  13  cards.  Even  in  its  abridged  form,  however,  the  modern  deck  is  of <br/>profound  symbolic  importance,  for  its  arrangement  is  apparently  in  accord  with  the  divisions  of  the <br/>year.  The  two  colors,  red  and  black,  represent  the  two  grand  divisions  of  the  year &#x2014;that  during  which <br/>the  sun  is  north  of  the  equator  and  that  during  which  it  is  south  of  the  equator.  The  four  suits <br/>represent  the  seasons,  the  ages  of  the  ancient  Greeks,  and  the  Yugas  of  the  Hindus.  The  twelve  court <br/>cards  are  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  arranged  in  triads  of  a  Father,  a  Power,  and  a  Mind  according  to  the <br/>upper  section  of  the  Bembine  Table.  The  ten  pip  cards  of  each  suit  represent  the  Sephirothic  trees <br/>existing  in  each  of  the  four  worlds  (the  suits).  The  13  cards  of  each  suit  are  the  13  lunar  months  in <br/>each  year,  and  the  52  cards  of  the  deck  are  the  52  weeks  in  the  year.  Counting  the  number  of  pips  and <br/>reckoning  the  jacks,  queens,  and  kings  as  11, 12,  and  13  respectively,  the  sum  for  the  52  cards  is  364.  If <br/>the  joker  be  considered  as  one  point,  the  result  is  365,  or  the  number  of  days  in  the  year.  Milton <br/>Pottenger  believed  that  the  United  States  of  America  was  laid  out  according  to  the  conventional  deck <br/>of  playing  cards,  and  that  the  government  will  ultimately  consist  of  52  States  administered  by  a  53rd <br/>undenominated  division,  the  District  of  Columbia. <br/><br/>The  court  cards  contain  a  number  of  important  Masonic  symbols.  Nine  are  full  face  and  three  are <br/>profile.  Here  is  the  broken  &quot;Wheel  of  the  Law,&quot;  signifying  the  nine  months  of  the  prenatal  epoch  and <br/>the  three  degrees  of  spiritual  unfoldment  necessary  to  produce  the  perfect  man.  The  four  armed  kings <br/>are  the  Egyptian  Ammonian  Architects  who  gouged  out  the  universe  with  knives.  They  are  also  the <br/>cardinal  signs  of  the  zodiac.  The  four  queens,  carrying  eight-petaled  flowers  symbolic  of  the  Christ, <br/>are  the  fixed  signs  of  the  zodiac.  The  four  jacks,  two  of  whom  bear  acacia  sprigs&#x2014;the  jack  of  hearts  in <br/>his  hand,  the  jack  of  clubs  in  his  hat-are  the  four  common  signs  of  the  zodiac.  It  should  be  noted  also <br/><br/><br/>that  the  court  cards  of  the  spade  suit  will  not  look  upon  the  pip  in  the  corner  of  the  card  but  face  away <br/>from  it  as  though  fearing  this  emblem  of  death.  The  Grand  Master  of  the  Order  of  the  Cards  is  the <br/>king  of  clubs,  who  carries  the  orb  as  emblematic  of  his  dignity. <br/><br/>In  its  symbolism  chess  is  the  most  significant  of  all  games.  It  has  been  called  &quot;the  royal  game&quot;~the <br/>pastime  of  kings.  Like  the  Tarot  cards,  the  chessmen  represent  the  elements  of  life  and  philosophy. <br/>The  game  was  played  in  India  and  China  long  before  its  introduction  into  Europe.  East  Indian  princes <br/>were  wont  to  sit  on  the  balconies  of  their  palaces  and  play  chess  with  living  men  standing  upon  a <br/>checkerboard  pavement  of  black  and  white  marble  in  the  courtyard  below.  It  is  popularly  believed <br/>that  the  Egyptian  Pharaohs  played  chess,  but  an  examination  of  their  sculpture  and  illuminations  has <br/>led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  Egyptian  game  was  a  form  of  draughts.  In  China,  chessmen  are  often <br/>carved  to  represent  warring  dynasties,  as  the  Manchu  and  the  Ming.  The  chessboard  consists  of  64 <br/>squares  alternately  black  and  white  and  symbolizes  the  floor  of  the  House  of  the  Mysteries.  Upon  this <br/>field  of  existence  or  thought  move  a  number  of  strangely  carved  figures,  each  according  to  fixed  law. <br/>The  white  king  is  Ormuzd;  the  black  king,  Ahriman;  and  upon  the  plains  of  Cosmos  the  great  war <br/>between  Light  and  Darkness  is  fought  through  all  the  ages.  Of  the  philosophical  constitution  of  man, <br/>the  kings  represent  the  spirit;  the  queens  the  mind;  the  bishops  the  emotions;  the  knights  the  vitality; <br/>the  castles,  or  rooks,  the  physical  body.  The  pieces  upon  the  kings'  side  are  positive;  those  upon  the <br/>queens'  side,  negative.  The  pawns  are  the  sensory  impulses  and  perceptive  faculties&#x2014;the  eight  parts  of <br/>the  soul.  The  white  king  and  his  suite  symbolize  the  Self  and  its  vehicles;  the  black  king  and  his <br/>retinue,  the  not-self~the  false  Ego  and  its  legion.  The  game  of  chess  thus  sets  forth  the  eternal <br/>struggle  of  each  part  of  man's  compound  nature  against  the  shadow  of  itself.  The  nature  of  each  of  the <br/>chessmen  is  revealed  by  the  way  in  which  it  moves;  geometry  is  the  key  to  their  interpretation.  For <br/>example:  The  castle  (the  body)  moves  on  the  square;  the  bishop  (the  emotions)  moves  on  the  slant; <br/>the  king,  being  the  spirit,  cannot  be  captured,  but  loses  the  battle  when  so  surrounded  that  it  cannot <br/>escape. <br/><br/><br/>P133 <br/><br/><br/>The  Tabernacle  in  the  Wilderness <br/><br/>THERE  is  no  doubt  that  much  of  the  material  recorded  in  the  first  five  books  of  the  Old  Testament  is <br/>derived  from  the  initiatory  rituals  of  the  Egyptian  Mysteries.  The  priests  of  Isis  were  deeply  versed  in <br/>occult  lore,  and  the  Israelites  during  their  captivity  in  Egypt  learned  from  them  many  things <br/>concerning  the  significance  of  Divinity  and  the  manner  of  worshiping  It.  The  authorship  of  the  first <br/>five  books  of  the  Old  Testament  is  generally  attributed  to  Moses,  but  whether  or  not  he  was  the  actual <br/>writer  of  them  is  a  matter  of  controversy.  There  is  considerable  evidence  to  substantiate  the <br/>hypothesis  that  the  Pentateuch  was  compiled  at  a  much  later  date,  from  oral  traditions.  Concerning <br/>the  authorship  of  these  books,  Thomas  Inman  makes  a  rather  startling  statement:  &quot;It  is  true  that  we <br/>have  books  which  purport  to  be  the  books  of  Moses;  so  there  are,  or  have  been,  books  purporting  to <br/>be  written  by  Homer,  Orpheus,  Enoch,  Mormon,  and  Junius;  yet  the  existence  of  the  writings,  and  the <br/>belief  that  they  were  written  by  those  whose  name  they  bear,  are  no  real  evidences  of  the  men  or  the <br/>genuineness  of  the  works  called  by  their  names.  It  is  true  also  that  Moses  is  spoken  of  occasionally  in <br/>the  time  of  the  early  Kings  of  Jerusalem;  but  it  is  clear  that  these  passages  are  written  by  a  late  hand, <br/>and  have  been  introduced  into  the  places  where  they  are  found,  with  the  definite  intention  of  making <br/>it  appear  that  the  lawgiver  was  known  to  David  and  Solomon.&quot;  (See  Ancient  Faiths  Embodied  in <br/>Ancient  Names.) <br/><br/>While  this  noted  scholar  undoubtedly  had  much  evidence  to  support  his  belief,  it  seems  that  this <br/>statement  is  somewhat  too  sweeping  in  character.  It  is  apparently  based  upon  the  fact  that  Thomas <br/>Inman  doubted  the  historical  existence  of  Moses.  This  doubt  was  based  upon  the  etymological <br/>resemblance  of  the  word  Moses  to  an  ancient  name  for  the  sun.  As  the  result  of  these  deductions, <br/>Inman  sought  to  prove  that  the  Lawgiver  of  Israel  was  merely  another  form  of  the  omnipresent  solar <br/>myth.  While  Inman  demonstrated  that  by  transposing  two  of  the  ancient  letters  the  word  Moses  (nii^a) <br/>became  Shemmah  (na^y),  an  appellation  of  the  celestial  globe,  he  seems  to  have  overlooked  the  fact <br/>that  in  the  ancient  Mysteries  the  initiates  were  often  given  names  synonymous  with  the  sun,  to <br/>symbolize  the  fact  that  the  redemption  and  regeneration  of  the  solar  power  had  been  achieved  within <br/>their  own  natures.  It  is  far  more  probable  that  the  man  whom  we  know  as  Moses  was  an  accredited <br/>representative  of  the  secret  schools,  laboring&#x2014;as  many  other  emissaries  have  labored&#x2014;to  instruct <br/>primitive  races  in  the  mysteries  of  their  immortal  souls. <br/><br/>The  true  name  of  the  Grand  Old  Man  of  Israel  who  is  known  to  history  as  Moses  will  probably  never <br/>be  ascertained.  The  word  Moses,  when  understood  in  its  esoteric  Egyptian  sense,  means  one  who  has <br/>been  admitted  into  the  Mystery  Schools  of  Wisdom  and  ~as  gone  forth  to  teach  the  ignorant <br/>concerning  the  will  of  the  gods  and  the  mysteries  of  life,  as  these  mysteries  were  explained  within  the <br/>temples  of  Isis,  Osiris,  and  Serapis.  There  is  much  controversy  concerning  the  nationality  of  Moses. <br/>Some  assert  that  he  was  a  Jew,  adopted  and  educated  by  the  ruling  house  of  Egypt;  others  hold  the <br/>opinion  that  he  was  a  full-blooded  Egyptian.  A  few  even  believe  him  to  be  identical  with  the  immortal <br/>Hermes,  for  both  these  illustrious  founders  of  religious  systems  received  tablets  from  heaven <br/>supposedly  written  by  the  finger  of  God.  The  stories  told  concerning  Moses,  his  discovery  in  the  ark  of <br/>bulrushes  by  Pharaoh's  daughter,  his  adoption  into  the  royal  family  of  Egypt,  and  his  later  revolt <br/>against  Egyptian  autocracy  coincide  exactly  with  certain  ceremonies  through  which  the  candidates  of <br/>the  Egyptian  Mysteries  passed  in  their  ritualistic  wanderings  in  search  of  truth  and  understanding. <br/>The  analogy  can  also  be  traced  in  the  movements  of  the  heavenly  bodies. <br/><br/>It  is  not  strange  that  the  erudite  Moses,  initiated  in  Egypt,  should  teach  the  Jews  a  philosophy <br/>containing  the  more  important  principles  of  Egyptian  esotericism.  The  religions  of  Egypt  at  the  time <br/>of  the  Israelitic  captivity  were  far  older  than  even  the  Egyptians  themselves  realized.  Histories  were <br/>difficult  to  compile  in  those  days,  and  the  Egyptians  were  satisfied  to  trace  their  race  back  to  a <br/><br/><br/>mythological  period  when  the  gods  themselves  walked  the  earth  and  with  their  own  power <br/><br/>established  the  Double  Empire  of  the  Nile.  The  Egyptians  did  not  dream  that  these  divine  progenitors <br/>were  the  Atlanteans,  who,  forced  to  abandon  their  seven  islands  because  of  volcanic  cataclysms,  had <br/>immigrated  into  Egypt &#x2014;then  an  Atlantean  colony&#x2014;where  they  established  a  great  philosophic  and <br/>literary  center  of  civilization  which  was  later  to  influence  profoundly  the  religions  and  science  of <br/>unnumbered  races  and  peoples.  Today  Egypt  is  forgotten,  but  things  Egyptian  will  always  be <br/>remembered  and  revered.  Egypt  is  dead&#x2014;yet  it  lives  immortal  in  its  philosophy,  and  architectonics. <br/><br/>As  Odin  founded  his  Mysteries  in  Scandinavia,  and  Quexalcoatl  in  Mexico,  so  Moses,  laboring  with <br/>the  then  nomadic  people  of  Israel's  twelve  tribes,  established  in  the  midst  of  them  his  secret  and <br/>symbolic  school,  which  has  came  to  be  known  as  The  Tabernacle  Mysteries.  The  Tabernacle  of:  the <br/>Jews  was  merely  a  temple  patterned  after  the  temples  of  Egypt,  and  transportable  to  meet  the  needs <br/>of  that  roving  disposition  which  the  Israelites  were  famous.  Every  part  of  the  Tabernacle  and  the <br/>enclosure  which  surrounded  it  was  symbolic  of  some  great  natural  or  philosophic  truth.  To  the <br/>ignorant  it  was  but  a  place  to  which  to  bring  offerings  and  in  which  to  make  sacrifice;  to  the  wise  it <br/>was  a  temple  of  learning,  sacred  to  the  Universal  Spirit  of  Wisdom. <br/><br/>While  the  greatest,  minds  of  the  Jewish  and  Christian  worlds  have  realized  that  the  Bible  is  a  book  of <br/>allegories,  few  seem  to  have  taken  the  trouble  to  investigate  its  symbols  and  parables.  When  Moses <br/>instituted  his  Mysteries,  he  is  said  to  have  given  to  a  chosen  few  initiates  certain  oral  teachings  which <br/>could  never  be  written  but  were  to  be  preserved  from  one  generation  to  the  next  by  word-of-mouth <br/>transmission.  Those  instructions  were  in  the  form  of  philosophical  keys,  by  means  of  which  the <br/>allegories  were  made  to  reveal  their  hidden  significance.  These  mystic  keys  to  their  sacred  writings <br/>were  called  by  the  Jews  the  Qabbalah  {Cabala,  Kaballah). <br/><br/>The  modem  world  seems  to  have  forgotten  the  existence  of  those  unwritten  teachings  which <br/>explained  satisfactorily  the  apparent  contradictions  of  the  written  Scriptures,  nor  does  it  remember <br/>that  the  pagans  appointed  their  two-faced  Janus  as  custodian  of  the  key  to  the  Temple  of  Wisdom. <br/>Janus  has  been  metamorphosed  into  St.  Peter,  so  often  symbolized  as  holding  in  his  hand  the  key  to <br/>the  gate  of  heaven.  The  gold  and  silver  keys  of  &quot;God's  Vicar  on  Earth,&quot;  the  Pope,  symbolizes  this <br/>&quot;secret  doctrine&quot;  which,  when  properly  understood,  unlocks  the  treasure  chest  of  the  Christian  and <br/>Jewish  Qabbalah. <br/><br/>The  temples  of  Egyptian  mysticism  (from  which  the  Tabernacle  was  copied)  were&#x2014; according  to  their <br/>own  priests&#x2014; miniature  representations  of  the  universe.  The  solar  system  was  always  regarded  as  a <br/>great  temple  of  initiation,  which  candidates  entered  through  the  gates  of  birth;  after  threading  the <br/>tortuous  passageways  of  earthly  existence,  they  finally  approached  the  veil  of  the  Great  Mystery- <br/>Death&#x2014; through  whose  gate  they  vanished  back  into  the  invisible  world.  Socrates  subtly  reminded  his <br/>disciples  that  Death  was,  in  reality,  the  great  initiation,  for  his  last  words  were:  &quot;Crito,  I  owe  a  cock  to <br/>Asclepius;  will  you  remember  to  pay  the  debt?&quot;  (As  the  rooster  was  sacred  to  the  gods  and  the <br/>sacrifice  of  this  bird  accompanied  a  candidate's  introduction  into  the  Mysteries,  Socrates  implied  that <br/>he  was  about  to  take  his  great  initiation.) <br/><br/>Life  is  the  great  mystery,  and  only  those  who  pass  successfully  through  its  tests  and  trials, <br/>interpreting  them  aright  and  extracting  the  essence  of  experience  therefrom,  achieve  true <br/>understanding.  Thus,  the  temples  were  built  in  the  form  of  the  world  and  their  rituals  were  based <br/>upon  life  and  its  multitudinous  problems.  Nor  only  was  the  Tabernacle  itself  patterned  according  to <br/>Egyptian  mysticism;  its  utensils  were  also  of  ancient  and  accepted  form.  The  Ark <br/><br/><br/>ANCIENT  OF  DAYS.' <br/><br/><br/>From  Montfaucon's  Antiquities. <br/><br/>It  is  in  this  form  that  Jehovah  is  generally  pictured  by  the  Qabbalists.  The  drawing  is  intended  to  represent  the  Demiurgus <br/>of  the  Greeks  and  Gnostics,  called  by  the  Greeks  &quot;Zeus,&quot;  the  Immortal  Mortal,  and  by  the  Hebrews  &quot;IHVH.&quot; <br/><br/>P134 <br/><br/>of  the  Covenant  itself  was  an  adaptation  of  the  Egyptian  Ark,  even  to  the  kneehng  figures  upon  its  Hd. <br/>Bas-reliefs  on  the  Temple  of  Philae  show  Egyptian  priests  carrying  their  Ark&#x2014;which  closely  resembled <br/>the  Ark  of  the  Jews&#x2014;upon  their  shoulders  by  means  of  staves  like  those  described  in  Exodus. <br/><br/>The  following  description  of  the  Tabernacle  and  its  priests  is  based  upon  the  account  of  its <br/>construction  and  ceremonies  recorded  by  Josephus  in  the  Third  Book  of  his  Antiquities  of  the  Jews. <br/>The  Bible  references  are  from  a  &quot;Breeches&quot;  Bible  (famous  for  its  rendering  of  the  seventh  verse  of  the <br/>third  chapter  of  Genesis),  printed  in  London  in  1599,  and  the  quotations  are  reproduced  in  their <br/>original  spelling  and  punctuation. <br/><br/>THE  BUILDING  OF  THE  TABERNACLE <br/><br/>Moses,  speaking  for  Jehovah,  the  God  of  Israel,  appointed  two  architects  to  superintend  the  building <br/>of  the  Tabernacle.  They  were  Besaleel,  the  son  of  Uri,  of  the  tribe  of  Judah,  and  Aholiab,  the  son  of <br/>Ahisamach,  of  the  tribe  of  Dan.  Their  popularity  was  so  great  that  they  were  also  the  unanimous <br/>choice  of  the  people.  When  Jacob  upon  his  deathbed  blessed  his  sons  (see  Genesis  xlix),  he  assigned <br/>to  each  a  symbol.  The  symbol  of  Judah  was  a  lion;  that  of  Dan  a  serpent  or  a  bird  (possibly  an  eagle). <br/>The  lion  and  the  eagle  are  two  of  the  four  beasts  of  the  Cherubim  (the  fixed  signs  of  the  zodiac);  and <br/>the  Rosicrucian  alchemists  maintained  that  the  mysterious  Stone  of  the  Wise  (the  Soul)  was <br/>compounded  with  the  aid  of  the  Blood  of  the  Red  Lion  and  the  Gluten  of  the  White  Eagle.  It  seems <br/>probable  that  there  is  a  hidden  mystic  relationship  between  fire  (the  Red  Lion),  water  (the  White <br/>Eagle),  as  they  were  used  in  occult  chemistry,  and  the  representatives  of  these  two  tribes  whose <br/>symbols  were  identical  with  these  alchemical  elements. <br/><br/>As  the  Tabernacle  was  the  dwelling  place  of  God  among  men,  likewise  the  soul  body  in  man  is  the <br/>dwelling  place  of  his  divine  nature,  round  which  gathers  a  twelvefold  material  constitution  in  the <br/>same  manner  that  the  tribes  of  Israel  camped  about  the  enclosure  sacred  to  Jehovah.  The  idea  that <br/>the  Tabernacle  was  really  symbolic  of  an  invisible  spiritual  truth  outside  the  comprehension  of  the <br/>Israelites  is  substantiated  by  a  statement  made  in  the  eighth  chapter  of  Hebrews:  &quot;Who  serve  unto  the <br/>paterne  and  shadowe  of  heavenly  things,  as  Moses  was  warned  by  God,  when  he  was  about  to  finish <br/>the  Tabernacle.&quot;  Here  we  find  the  material  physical  place  of  worship  called  a  &quot;shadow&quot;  or  symbol  of  a <br/>spiritual  institution,  invisible  but  omnipotent. <br/><br/>The  specifications  of  the  Tabernacle  are  described  in  the  book  of  Exodus,  twenty-fifth  chapter:  &quot;Then <br/>the  Lord  spake  unto  Moses,  saying,  Speake  unto  the  children  of  Israel  that  they  receive  an  offering  for <br/>me:  of  every  man,  whose  heart  giveth  it  freely,  yee  shall  take  the  offering  for  me.  And  this  is  the <br/>offering  which  ye  shall  take  of  them,  gold  and  silver,  and  brass,  and  blue  silke,  and  purple,  and  scarlet. <br/><br/><br/>and  fine  linnen  and  goats  haire.  And  rammes  skinnes  coloured  red,  and  the  skinnes  of  badgers,  and <br/>the  wood  Shittim,  oyle  for  the  hght,  spices  for  anoynting  oyle,  and  for  the  perfume  of  sweet  favour, <br/>onix  stones,  and  stories  to  be  set  in  the  Ephod,  and  in  the  breastplate.  Also  they  shall  make  me  a <br/>Sanctuary,  that  I  may  dwell  among  them.  According  to  all  that  I  shew  thee,  even  so  shall  ye  make  the <br/>forme  of  the  Tabernacle,  and  the  fashion  of  all  the  instruments  thereof.&quot; <br/><br/>The  court  of  the  Tabernacle  was  an  enclosed  area,  fifty  cubits  wide  and  one  hundred  cubits  long, <br/>circumscribed  by  a  wall  of  linen  curtains  hung  from  brazen  pillars  five  cubits  apart.  (The  cubit  is  an <br/>ancient  standard  of  measurement,  its  length  being  equal  to  the  distance  between  the  elbow  and  the <br/>extreme  end  of  the  index  finger,  approximately  eighteen  inches.)  There  were  twenty  of  these  pillars  on <br/>each  of  the  longer  sides  and  ten  on  the  shorter.  Each  pillar  had  a  base  of  brass  and  a  capital  of  silver. <br/>The  Tabernacle  was  always  laid  out  with  the  long  sides  facing  north  and  south  and  the  short  sides <br/>facing  east  and  west,  with  the  entrance  to  the  east,  thus  showing  the  influence  of  primitive  sun <br/>worship. <br/><br/>The  outer  court  served  the  principal  purpose  of  isolating  the  tent  of  the  Tabernacle  proper,  which <br/>stood  in  the  midst  of  the  enclosure.  At  the  entrance  to  the  courtyard,  which  was  in  the  eastern  face  of <br/>the  rectangle,  stood  the  Altar  of  Burnt  Offerings,  made  of  brass  plates  over  wood  and  ornamented <br/>with  the  horns  of  bulls  and  rams.  Farther  in,  but  on  a  line  with  this  altar,  stood  the  Laver  of <br/>Purification,  a  great  vessel  containing  water  for  priestly  ablutions.  The  Laver  was  twofold  in  its <br/>construction,  the  upper  part  being  a  large  bowl,  probably  covered,  which  served  as  a  source  of  supply <br/>for  a  lower  basin  in  which  the  priests  bathed  themselves  before  participating  in  the  various <br/>ceremonials.  It  is  supposed  that  this  Laver  was  encrusted  with  the  metal  mirrors  of  the  women  of  the <br/>twelve  tribes  of  Israel. <br/><br/>The  dimensions  of  the  Tabernacle  proper  were  as  follows:  &quot;Its  length,  when  it  was  set  up,  was  thirty <br/><br/>cubits,  and  its  breadth  was  ten  cubits.  The  one  of  its  walls  was  on  the  south,  and  the  other  was <br/>exposed  to  the  north,  and  on  the  back  part  of  it  remained  the  west.  It  was  necessary  that  its  height <br/>should  be  equal  to  its  breadth  (ten  cubits).&quot;  (Josephus.) <br/><br/>It  is  the  custom  of  bibliologists  to  divide  the  interior  of  the  Tabernacle  into  two  rooms:  one  room  ten <br/>cubits  wide,  ten  cubits  high,  and  twenty  cubits  long,  which  was  called  the  Holy  Place  and  contained <br/>three  special  articles  of  furniture,  namely,  the  Seven-Branched  Candlestick,  the  Table  of  the <br/>Shewbread,  and  the  Altar  of  Burnt  Incense;  the  other  room  ten  cubits  wide,  ten  cubits  high,  and  ten <br/>cubits  long,  which  was  called  the  Holy  of  Holies  and  contained  but  one  article  of  furniture&#x2014; the  Ark  of <br/>the  Covenant.  The  two  rooms  were  separated  from  each  other  by  an  ornamental  veil  upon  which  were <br/>embroidered  many  kinds  of  flowers,  but  no  animal  or  human  figures. <br/><br/>Josephus  hints  that  there  was  a  third  compartment  which  was  formed  by  subdividing  the  Holy  Place, <br/>at  least  hypothetically,  into  two  chambers.  The  Jewish  historian  is  not  very  explicit  in  his  description <br/>of  this  third  room,  and  the  majority  of  writers  seem  to  have  entirely  overlooked  and  neglected  this <br/>point,  although  Josephus  emphatically  states  that  Moses  himself  divided  the  inner  tent  into  three <br/>sections.  The  veil  separating  the  Holy  Place  from  the  Holy  of  Holies  was  hung  across  four  pillars, <br/>which  probably  indicated  in  a  subtle  way  the  four  elements,  while  at  the  entrance  to  the  tent  proper <br/>the  Jews  placed  seven  pillars,  referring  to  the  seven  senses  and  the  seven  vowels  of  the  Sacred  Name. <br/>That  later  only  five  pillars  are  mentioned  may  be  accounted  for  by  the  fact  that  at  the  present  time <br/>man  has  only  five  developed  senses  and  five  active  vowels.  The  early  Jewish  writer  of  The  Baraitha <br/>treats  of  the  curtains  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;There  were  provided  ten  curtains  of  blue,  of  purple,  and  scarlet,  and  fine-twined  linen.  As  is  said, <br/>'Moreover  thou  shall  make  the  tabernacle  with  ten  curtains  of  fine-twined  linen,  and  blue,  and  purple, <br/>and  scarlet.'  *  *  *  There  were  provided  eleven  curtains  of  goats'  hair,  and  the  length  of  every  one  of <br/><br/><br/>them  was  thirty  cubits,  *  *  *.  Rabbi  Judah  said,  'There  were  two  covers-the  lower  one  of  rams'  skins <br/>dyed  red,  and  the  upper  one  of  badgers'  skins.  &quot;' <br/><br/>Calmet  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  Hebrew  word  translated  &quot;badger&quot;  really  means  &quot;dark  purple&quot;  and <br/>therefore  did  not  refer  to  any  particular  animal,  but  probably  to  a  heavily  woven  waterproof  fabric  of <br/>dark  and  inconspicuous  color.  During  the  time  of  Israel's  wanderings  through  the  wilderness,  it  is <br/>supposed  that  a  pillar  of  fire  hovered  over  the  Tabernacle  at  night,  while  a  column  of  smoke  traveled <br/>with  it  by  day.  This  cloud  was  called  by  the  Jews  the  Shechinah  and  was  symbolic  of  the  presence  of <br/>the  Lord.  In  one  of  the  early  Jewish  books  rejected  at  the  time  of  the  compiling  of  the  Talmud  the <br/>following  description  of  the  Shechinah  appears: <br/><br/>&quot;Then  a  cloud  covered  the  tent  of  the  congregation,  and  the  glory  of  the  Lord  filled  the  Tabernacle. <br/>And  that  was  one  of  the  clouds  of  glory,  which  served  the  Israelites  in  the  wilderness  forty  years.  One <br/>on  the  right  hand,  and  one  on  the  left,  and  one  before  them,  and  one  behind  them.  And  one  over  them, <br/>and  a  cloud  dwelling  in  their  midst  (and  the  cloud,  the  Shechinah  which  was  in  the  tent),  and  the <br/>pillar  of  cloud  which  moved  before  them,  making  low  before  them  the  high  places,  and  making  high <br/>before  them  the  low  places,  and  killing  serpents  and  scorpions,  and  burning  thorns  and  briars,  and <br/>guiding  them  in  the  straight  way.&quot;  (From  The  Baraitha,  the  Book  of  the  Tabernacle.) <br/><br/><br/>THE  FURNISHINGS  OF  THE  TABERNACLE <br/><br/><br/>There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Tabernacle,  its  furnishings  and  ceremonials,  when  considered  esoterically, <br/>are  analogous  to  the  structure,  organs,  and  functions  of  the  human  body.  At  the  entrance  to  the  outer <br/>court  of  the  Tabernacle  stood  the  Altar  of  Burnt  Offerings,  five  cubits  long  and  five  cubits  wide  but <br/>only  three  cubits  high.  Its  upper  surface  was  a  brazen  grill  upon  which  the  sacrifice  was  placed,  while <br/>beneath  was  a  space  for  the  fire.  This  altar  signified <br/><br/><br/>From  Calmet's  Dictionary  of  the  Holy  Bible. <br/><br/><br/>The  order  of  the  stones  and  the  tribe  over  which  each  administered  were,  according  to  Calmet,  as  in  the  above  diagram. <br/>These  gems,  according  to  the  Rosicrucians,  were  symboHc  of  the  twelve  great  quaUties  and  virtues:  Illumination,  Love, <br/>Wisdom,  Truth,  Justice,  Peace,  Equilibrium,  Humility,  Faith,  Strength,  Joy,  Victory. <br/><br/>P135 <br/><br/>that  a  candidate,  when  first  entering  the  precincts  of  sanctuary,  must  offer  upon  the  brazen  altar  not  a <br/>poor  unoffending  bull  or  ram  but  its  correspondence  within  his  own  nature.  The  bull,  being  symbolic <br/>of  earthiness,  represented  his  own  gross  constitution  which  must  be  burned  up  by  the  fire  of  his <br/>Divinity.  (The  sacrificing  of  beasts,  and  in  some  cases  human  beings,  upon  the  altars  of  the  pagans <br/>was  the  result  of  their  ignorance  concerning  the  fundamental  principle  underlying  sacrifice.  They  did <br/>not  realize  that  their  offerings  must  come  from  within  their  own  natures  in  order  to  be  acceptable.) <br/><br/>Farther  westward,  in  line  with  the  Brazen  Altar,  was  the  Laver  of  Purification  already  described.  It <br/>signified  to  the  priest  that  he  should  cleanse  not  only  his  body  but  also  his  soul  from  all  stains  of <br/>impurity,  for  none  who  is  not  clean  in  both  body  and  mind  can  enter  into  the  presence  of  Divinity  and <br/>live.  Beyond  the  Laver  of  Purification  was  the  entrance  to  the  Tabernacle  proper,  facing  the  east,  so <br/>that  the  first  rays  of  the  rising  sun  might  enter  and  light  the  chamber.  Between  the  encrusted  pillars <br/>could  be  seen  the  Holy  Place,  a  mysterious  chamber,  its  walls  hung  with  magnificent  drapes <br/>embroidered  with  the  faces  of  Cherubs. <br/><br/>Against  the  wall  on  the  southern  side  of  the  Holy  Place  stood  the  great  Candlestick,  or  lampstand,  of <br/>cast  gold,  which  was  believed  to  weigh  about  a  hundred  pounds.  From  its  central  shaft  branched  out <br/>six  arms,  each  ending  in  a  cup-shaped  depression  in  which  stood  an  oil  lamp.  There  were  seven  lamps, <br/>three  on  the  arms  at  each  side  and  one  on  the  central  stem.  The  Candlestick  was  ornamented  with <br/>seventy-two  almonds,  knops,  and  flowers.  Josephus  says  seventy,  but  wherever  this  round  number  is <br/>used  by  the  Hebrews  it  really  means  seventy-two.  Opposite  the  Candlestick,  against  the  northern  wall, <br/>was  a  table  bearing  twelve  loaves  of  Shewbread  in  two  stacks  of  six  loaves  each.  (Calmet  is  of  the <br/>opinion  that  the  bread  was  not  stacked  up  but  spread  out  on  the  table  in  two  rows,  each  containing  six <br/>loaves.)  On  this  table  also  stood  two  lighted  incensories,  which  were  placed  upon  the  tops  of  the <br/>stacks  of  Shewbread  so  that  the  smoke  of  the  incense  might  be  an  acceptable  aroma  to  the  Lord, <br/>bearing  with  it  in  its  ascent  the  soul  of  the  Shewbread. <br/><br/>In  the  center  of  the  room,  almost  against  the  partition  leading  into  the  Holy  of  Holies,  stood  the  Altar <br/>of  Burnt  Incense,  made  of  wood  overlaid  with  golden  plates.  Its  width  and  length  were  each  a  cubit <br/>and  its  height  was  two  cubits.  This  altar  was  symbolic  of  the  human  larynx,  from  which  the  words  of <br/>man's  mouth  ascend  as  an  acceptable  offering  unto  the  Lord,  for  the  larynx  occupies  the  position  in <br/>the  constitution  of  man  between  the  Holy  Place,  which  is  the  trunk  of  his  body,  and  the  Holy  of  Holies, <br/>which  is  the  head  with  its  contents. <br/><br/>Into  the  Holy  of  Holies  none  might  pass  save  the  High  Priest,  and  he  only  at  certain  prescribed  times. <br/>The  room  contained  no  furnishings  save  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant,  which  stood  against  the  western <br/>wall,  opposite  the  entrance.  In  Exodus  the  dimensions  of  the  Ark  are  given  as  two  and  a  half  cubits  for <br/>its  length,  one  cubit  and  a  half  its  breadth  and  one  cubit  and  a  half  its  height.  It  was  made  of  shittim- <br/>wood,  gold  plated  within  and  without,  and  contained  the  sacred  tablets  of  the  Law  delivered  to  Moses <br/>upon  Sinai.  The  lid  of  the  Ark  was  in  the  form  of  a  golden  plate  upon  which  knelt  two  mysterious <br/>creatures  called  Cherubim,  facing  each  other,  with  wings  arched  overhead.  It  was  upon  this  mercy <br/>seat  between  the  wings  of  the  celestials  that  the  Lord  of  Israel  descended  when  He  desired  to <br/>communicate  with  His  High  Priest. <br/><br/>The  furnishings  of  the  Tabernacle  were  made  conveniently  portable.  Each  altar  and  implement  of  any <br/>size  was  supplied  with  staves  which  could  be  put:  through  rings;  by  this  means  it  could  be  picked  up <br/>and  carried  by  four  or  more  bearers.  The  staves  were  never  removed  from  the  Ark  of  the  Covenant <br/>until  it  was  finally  placed  in  the  Holy  of  Holies  of  the  Everlasting  House,  King  Solomon's  Temple. <br/><br/><br/>There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Jews  in  early  times  reahzed,  at  least  in  part,  that  their  Tabernacle  was  a <br/>symbolic  edifice.  Josephus  realized  this  and  while  he  has  been  severely  criticized  because  he <br/>interpreted  the  Tabernacle  symbolism  according  to  Egyptian  and  Grecian  paganism,  his  description <br/>of  the  secret  meanings  of  its  drapes  and  furnishings  is  well  worthy  of  consideration.  He  says: <br/><br/>&quot;When  Moses  distinguished  the  tabernacle  into  three  parts,  and  allowed  two  of  them  to  the  priests,  as <br/>a  place  accessible  and  common,  he  denoted  the  land  and  the  sea,  these  being  of  general  access  to  all; <br/>but  he  set  apart  the  third  division  for  God,  because  heaven  is  inaccessible  to  men.  And  when  he <br/>ordered  twelve  loaves  to  be  set  on  a  table,  he  denoted  the  year,  as  distinguished  into  so  many  months. <br/>By  branching  out  the  candlestick  into  seventy  parts,  he  secretly  intimated  the  Decani,  or  seventy <br/>divisions  of  the  planets;  and  as  to  the  seven  lamps  upon  the  candlesticks,  they  referred  to  the  course <br/>of  the  planets,  of  which  that  is  the  number.  The  veils  too,  which  were  composed  of  four  things,  they <br/>declared  the  four  elements;  for  the  plain  linen  was  proper  to  signify  the  earth,  because  the  flax  grows <br/>out  of  the  earth;  the  purple  signified  the  sea,  because  that  color  is  dyed  by  the  blood  of  a  sea  shell-fish; <br/>the  blue  is  fit  to  signify  the  air;  and  the  scarlet  will  naturally  be  an  indication  of  fire. <br/><br/>&quot;Now  the  vestment  of  the  high -priest  being  made  of  linen,  signified  the  earth;  the  blue  denoted  the <br/>sky,  being  like  lightning  in  its  pomegranates,  and  in  the  noise  of  the  bells  resembling  thunder.  And  for <br/>the  Ephod,  it  showed  that  God  had  made  the  universe  of  four  (elements);  and  as  for  the  gold <br/>interwoven,  *  *  *  it  related  to  the  splendor  by  which  all  things  are  enlightened.  He  also  appointed  the <br/>breastplate  to  be  placed  in  the  middle  of  the  Ephod,  to  resemble  the  earth,  for  that  has  the  very <br/>middle  place  of  the  world.  And  the  girdle  which  encompassed  the  high-priest  round  signified  the <br/>ocean,  for  that  goes  round  about  and  includes  the  universe.  Each  of  the  sardonyxes  declares  to  us  the <br/>sun  and  the  moon,  those,  I  mean,  that  were  in  the  nature  of  buttons  on  the  high-priest's  shoulders. <br/>And  for  the  twelve  stones,  whether  we  understand  by  them  the  months,  or  whether  we  understand <br/>the  like  number  of  the  signs  of  that  circle  which  the  Greeks  call  the  Zodiac,  we  shall  not  be  mistaken <br/>in  their  meaning.  And  for  the  mitre,  which  was  of  a  blue  colour,  it  seems  to  me  to  mean  heaven;  for <br/>how  otherwise  could  the  name  of  God  be  inscribed  upon  it?  That  it  was  also  illustrated  with  a  crown, <br/>and  that  of  gold  also,  is  because  of  that  splendour  with  which  God  is  pleased.&quot;  It  is  also  symbolically <br/>significant  that  the  Tabernacle  was  built  in  seven  months  and  dedicated  to  God  at  the  time  of  the  new <br/>moon. <br/><br/>The  metals  used  in  the  building  of  the  Tabernacle  were  all  emblematic.  Gold  represents  spirituality, <br/>and  the  golden  plates  laid  over  the  shittim-wood  were  emblems  of  the  spiritual  nature  which  glorifies <br/>the  human  nature  symbolized  by  the  wood.  Mystics  have  taught  that  man's  physical  body  is <br/>surrounded  by  a  series  of  invisible  bodies  of  diverse  colors  and  great  splendor.  In  the  majority  of <br/>people  the  spiritual  nature  is  concealed  and  imprisoned  in  the  material  nature,  but  in  a  few  this <br/>internal  constitution  has  been  objectified  and  the  spiritual  nature  is  outside,  so  that  it  surrounds <br/>man's  personality  with  a  great  radiance. <br/><br/>Silver,  used  as  the  capitals  for  the  pillars,  has  its  reference  to  the  moon,  which  was  sacred  to  the  Jews <br/>and  the  Egyptians  alike.  The  priests  held  secret  ritualistic  ceremonies  at  the  time  of  the  new  and  the <br/>full  moon,  both  of  which  periods  were  sacred  to  Jehovah.  Silver,  so  the  ancients  taught,  was  gold  with <br/>its  sun-ray  turned  inward  instead  of  objectified.  While  gold  symbolized  the  spiritual  soul,  silver <br/>represented  the  purified  and  regenerated  human  nature  of  man. <br/><br/>The  brass  used  in  the  outer  altars  was  a  composite  substance  consisting  of  an  alloy  of  precious  and <br/>base  metals.  Thus,  it  represented  the  constitution  of  the  average  individual,  who  is  a  combination  of <br/>both  the  higher  and  the  lower  elements. <br/><br/>The  three  divisions  of  the  Tabernacle  should  have  a  special  interest  to  Freemasons,  for  they  represent <br/><br/>the  three  degrees  of  the  Blue  Lodge,  while  the  three  orders  of  priests  who  served  the  Tabernacle  are <br/>preserved  to  modern  Masonry  as  the  Entered  Apprentice,  the  Fellow  Craftsman,  and  the  Master <br/><br/><br/>Mason.  The  Hawaiian  Islanders  built  a  Tabernacle  not  unlike  that  of  the  Jews,  except  that  their  rooms <br/>were  one  above  another  and  not  one  behind  another,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Tabernacle  of  the  Israelites. <br/>The  three  rooms  are  also  the  three  important  chambers  of  the  Great  Pyramid  of  Gizeh. <br/><br/>THE  ROBES  OF  GLORY <br/><br/>As  explained  in  the  quotation  from  Josephus,  the  robes  and  adornments  of  the  Jewish  priests  had  a <br/>secret  significance,  and  even  to  this  day  there  is  a  religious  cipher  language  concealed  in  the  colors, <br/>forms,  and  uses  of  sacred  garments,  not  only  among  the  Christian  and  Jewish  priests  but  also  among <br/>pagan  religions.  The  vestments  of  the  Tabernacle  priests  were  called  Cahanaeae;  those  of  the  High <br/>Priest  were  termed  Cahansese  Rahhse.  Over  the  Machanese,  an  undergarment  resembling  short <br/>trousers,  they  wore  the  Chethone,  a  finely  woven  linen  robe,  which  reached  to  the  ground  and  had <br/>long  sleeves  tied  to  the  arms  of  the  wearer.  A  brightly  embroidered  sash,  twisted  several  times  around <br/>the  waist  (a  little  higher  than  is  customary),  with  one  end  pendent  in  front,  and  a  closely  fitting  linen <br/>cap,  designated  Masnaemphthes,  completed  the  costume  of  the  ordinary  priest. <br/><br/><br/>THE  GARMENTS  OF  GLORY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Mosaize  Historie  der  Hebreeuwse  Kerke. <br/><br/>Th.  robe  of  the  High  Priest  of  Israel  were  often  called  &quot;The  Garments  of  Glory&quot;,  for  they  resembled  the  regenerated  and <br/>spiritualized  nature  of  man,  symbolized  by  a  vestment  which  all  must  weave  from  the  threads  of  character  and  virtue <br/>before  they  can  become  High  Priests  after  the  Order  of  Melchizedek. <br/><br/>p.  136 <br/><br/>The  vestments  of  the  High  Priest  were  the  same  as  those  of  the  lesser  degrees,  except  that  certain <br/>garments  and  adornments  were  added.  Over  the  specially  woven  white  linen  robe  the  High  Priest <br/>wore  a  seamless  and  sleeveless  habit,  sky-blue  in  color  and  reaching  nearly  to  his  feet.  This  was  called <br/>the  Meeir  and  was  ornamented  with  a  fringe  of  alternated  golden  bells  and  pomegranates.  In <br/>Ecclesiasticus  (one  of  the  books  rejected  from  the  modern  Bible),  these  bells  and  their  purpose  are <br/>described  in  the  following  words:  &quot;And  he  compassed  him  with  pomegranates,  and  with  many  golden <br/>bells  round  about,  that  as  he  went,  there  might  be  a  sound  and  a  noise  that  might  be  heard  in  the <br/>temple,  for  a  memorial  to  the  children  of  his  people.&quot;  The  Meeir  was  also  bound  in  with  a  variegated <br/>girdle  finely  embroidered  and  with  gold  wire  inserted  through  the  embroidery. <br/><br/>The  Ephod,  a  short  vestment  described  by  Josephus  as  resembling  a  coat  or  jacket,  was  worn  over  the <br/>upper  part  of  the  Meeir.  The  threads  of  which  the  Ephod  was  woven  were  of  many  colors,  probably <br/><br/><br/>red,  blue,  purple,  and  white,  like  the  curtains  and  coverings  of  the  Tabernacle.  Fine  gold  wires  were <br/>also  woven  into  the  fabric.  The  Ephod  was  fastened  at  each  shoulder  with  a  large  onyx  in  the  form  of  a <br/>button,  and  the  names  of  the  twelve  sons  of  Jacob  were  engraven  upon  these  two  stones,  six  on  each. <br/>These  onyx  buttons  were  supposed  to  have  oracular  powers,  and  when  the  High  Priest  asked  certain <br/>questions,  they  emitted  a  celestial  radiance.  When  the  onyx  on  the  right  shoulder  was  illuminated,  it <br/>signified  that  Jehovah  answered  the  question  of  the  High  Priest:  in  the  affirmative,  and  when  the  one <br/>on  the  left  gleamed,  it  indicated  a  negative  answer  to  the  query. <br/><br/>In  the  middle  of  the  front  surface  of  the  Ephod  was  a  space  to  accommodate  the  Essen,  or  Breastplate <br/>of  Righteousness  and  Prophecy,  which,  as  its  name  signifies,  was  also  an  oracle  of  great  power.  This <br/>pectoral  was  roughly  square  in  shape  and  consisted  of  a  frame  of  embroidery  into  which  were  set <br/>twelve  stones,  each  held  in  a  socket  of  gold.  Because  of  the  great  weight  of  its  stones,  each  of  which <br/>was  of  considerable  size  and  immense  value,  the  breastplate  was  held  in  position  by  special  golden <br/>chains  and  ribbons.  The  twelve  stones  of  the  breastplate,  like  the  onyx  stones  at  the  shoulders  of  the <br/>Ephod,  had  the  mysterious  power  of  lighting  up  with  Divine  glory  and  so  serving  as  oracles. <br/>Concerning  the  strange  power  of  these  flashing  symbols  of  Israel's  twelve  tribes,  Josephus  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;Yet  will  I  mention  what  is  still  more  wonderful  than  this:  For  God  declared  beforehand,  by  those <br/>twelve  stones  which  the  High  Priest  bare  upon  his  breast  and  which  were  inserted  into  his  breastplate, <br/>when  they  should  be  victorious  in  battle;  for  so  great  a  splendor  shone  forth  from  them  before  the <br/>army  began  to  march,  that  all  the  people  were  sensible  of  God's  being  present  for  their  assistance. <br/>Whence  it  came  to  pass  that  those  Greeks,  who  had  a  veneration  for  our  laws,  because  they  could  not <br/>possibly  contradict  this,  called  the  breastplate,  'the  Oracle'.&quot;  The  writer  then  adds  that  the  stones <br/>ceased  to  light  up  and  gleam  some  two  hundred  years  before  he  wrote  his  history,  because  the  Jews <br/>had  broken  the  laws  of  Jehovah  and  the  God  of  Israel  was  no  longer  pleased  with  His  chosen  people. <br/><br/>The  Jews  learned  astronomy  from  the  Egyptians,  and  it  is  not  unlikely  that  the  twelve  jewels  of  the <br/>breastplate  were  symbolic  of  the  twelve  constellations  of  the  zodiac.  These  twelve  celestial  hierarchies <br/>were  looked  upon  as  jewels  adorning  the  breastplate  of  the  Universal  Man,  the  Macroprosophus,  who <br/>is  referred  to  in  the  Zohar  as  The  Ancient  of  Days.  The  number  twelve  frequently  occurs  among <br/>ancient  peoples,  who  in  nearly  every  case  had  a  pantheon  consisting  of  twelve  demigods  and <br/>goddesses  presided  over  by  The  Invincible  One,  who  was  Himself  subject  to  the  Incomprehensible <br/>All-Father.  This  use  of  the  number  twelve  is  especially  noted  in  the  Jewish  and  Christian  writings. <br/>The  twelve  prophets,  the  twelve  patriarchs,  the  twelve  tribes,  and  the  twelve  Apostles&#x2014;each  group  has <br/>a  certain  occult  significance,  for  each  refers  to  the  Divine  Duodecimo,  or  Twelvefold  Deity,  whose <br/>emanations  are  manifested  in  the  tangible  created  Universe  through  twelve  individualized  channels. <br/>The  secret  doctrine  also  caught  the  priests  that  the  jewels  represented  centers  of  life  within  their  own <br/>constitutions,  which  when  unfolded  according  to  the  esoteric  instructions  of  the  Temple,  were  capable <br/>of  absorbing  into  themselves  and  radiating  forth  again  the  Divine  light  of  the  Deity.  (The  East  Indian <br/>lotus  blossoms  have  a  similar  meaning.)  The  Rabbis  have  taught  that  each  twisted  linen  thread  used <br/>in  weaving  the  Tabernacle  curtains  and  ornamentations  consisted  of  twenty-four  separate  strands, <br/>reminding  the  discerning  that  the  experience,  gained  during  the  twenty-four  hours  of  the  day <br/>(symbolized  in  Masonry  by  the  twenty-four-inch  rule)  becomes  the  threads  from  which  are  woven  the <br/>Garments  of  Glory. <br/><br/>THE  URIM  AND  THUMMIM <br/><br/>In  the  reverse  side  of  the  Essen,  or  breastplate,  was  a  pocket  containing  mysterious  objects&#x2014;the  Urim <br/>and  Thummim.  Aside  from  the  fact  that  they  were  used  in  divination,  little  is  now  known  about  these <br/>objects.  Some  writers  contend  that  they  were  small  stones  (resembling  the  fetishes  still  revered  by <br/>certain  aboriginal  peoples)  which  the  Israelites  had  brought  with  them  out  of  Egypt  because  of  their <br/>belief  that  they  possessed  divine  power.  Others  believe  that  the  Urim  and  Thummim  were  in  the  form <br/>of  dice,  used  for  deciding  events  by  being  cast  upon  the  ground.  A  few  have  maintained  that  they  were <br/><br/><br/>merely  sacred  names,  written  on  plates  of  gold  and  carried  as  talismans.  &quot;According  to  some,  the <br/>Urim  and  the  Thummim  signify  'lights  and  perfections,'  or  'light  and  truth'  which  last  present  a <br/>striking  analogy  to  the.  two  figures  of  Re  (Ra)  and  Themi  in  the  breastplate  worn  by  the  Egyptians.&quot; <br/>(Gardner's  The  Faiths  of  the  World.) <br/><br/>Not  the  least  remarkable  of  the  vestments  of  the  High  Priest  was  his  bonnet,  or  headdress.  Over  the <br/>plain  white  cap  of  the  ordinary  priest  this  dignitary  wore  an  outer  cloth  of  blue  and  a  crown  of  gold, <br/>the  crown  consisting  of  three  bands,  one  above  the  other  like  the  triple  miter  of  the  Persian  Magi.  This <br/>crown  symbolized  that  the  High  Priest  was  ruler  not  only  over  the  three  worlds  which  the  ancients <br/>had  differentiated  (heaven,  earth,  and  hell),  but  also  over  the  threefold  divisions  of  man  and  the <br/>universe&#x2014;the  spiritual,  intellectual,  and  material  worlds.  These  divisions  were  also  symbolized  by  the <br/>three  apartments  of  the  Tabernacle  itself. <br/><br/>At  the  peak  of  the  headdress  was  a  tiny  cup  of  gold,  made  in  the  form  of  a  flower.  This  signified  that <br/>the  nature  of  the  priest  was  receptive  and  that  he  had  a  vessel  in  his  own  soul  which,  cuplike,  was <br/>capable  of  catching  the  eternal  waters  of  life  pouring  upon  him  from  the  heavens  above.  This  flower <br/>over  the  crown  of  his  head  is  similar  in  its  esoteric  meaning  to  the  rose  growing  out  of  a  skull,  so <br/>famous  in  Templar  symbology.  The  ancients  believed  that  the  spiritual  nature  escaping  from  the  body <br/>passed  upward  through  the  crown  of  the  head;  therefore,  the  flowerlike  calyx,  or  cup,  symbolized  also <br/>the  spiritual  consciousness.  On  the  front  of  the  golden  crown  were  inscribed  in  Hebrew,  Holiness <br/>unto  the  Lord. <br/><br/>Though  robes  and  ornaments  augmented  the  respect  and  veneration  of  the  Israelites  for  their  High <br/>Priest,  such  trappings  meant  nothing  to  Jehovah.  Therefore,  before  entering  the  Holy  of  Holies,  the <br/>High  Priest  removed  his  earthly  finery  and  entered  into  the  presence  of  the  Lord  God  of  Israel <br/>unclothed.  There  he  could  be  robed  only  in  his  own  virtues,  and  his  spirituality  must  adorn  him  as  a <br/>garment. <br/><br/>There  is  a  legend  to  the  effect  that  any  who  chanced  to  enter  the  Holy  of  Holies  unclean  were <br/>destroyed  by  a  bolt  of  Divine  fire  from  the  Mercy  Seat.  If  the  High  Priest  had  but  one  selfish  thought, <br/>he  would  be  struck  dead.  As  no  man  knows  when  an  unworthy  thought  may  flash  through  his  mind, <br/>precautions  had  to  be  taken  in  case  the  High  Priest  should  be  struck  dead  while  in  the  presence  of <br/>Jehovah.  The  other  priests  could  not  enter  the  sanctuary  therefore,  when  their  leader  was  about  to  go <br/>in  and  receive  the  commands  of  the  Lord,  they  tied  a  chain  around  one  of  his  feet  so  that  if  he  were <br/>struck  down  while  behind  the  veil  they  could  drag  the  body  out. <br/><br/><br/>THE  HEADDRESS  OF  THE  PRIESTS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Mosaize  Historie  der  Hebreeuwse  Kerke. <br/><br/>Over  the  plain  white  cap  of  the  ordinary  priests  the  High  Priest  wore  an  overcloth  of  blue  and  a  band  of  gold.  On  the  front <br/>of  the  golden  band  were  inscribed  the  Hebrew  words  &quot;Holiness  unto  the  Lord.&quot;  This  illustration  shows  the  arrangement  of <br/>the  bonnet  both  with  and  without  the  golden  crown. <br/><br/><br/>I-     -.  -^rrn <br/><br/>THE  ARK  WITH  ITS  CHERUBIM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Calmet's  Dictionary  of  the  Holy  Bible. <br/><br/><br/>Josephus  tells  its  that  the  Cherubim  were  flying  creatures  but  different  in  appearance,  from  anything  to  be  seen  on  earth; <br/>therefore  impossible  to  describe.  Moses  is  supposed  to  have  seen  these  beings  kneeling  at  the  footstool  of  God  when  he <br/>was  picked  up  and  brought  into  the  Presence  of  Jehovah.  It  is  probable  that  they  resembled,  at  least  in  general  appearance, <br/>the  famous  Cherubim  of  Ezekiel. <br/><br/><br/>P137 <br/><br/><br/>The  Fraternity  of  the  Rose  Cross <br/><br/>WHO  were  the  Rosicmcians?  Were  they  an  organization  of  profound  thinkers  rebeUing  against  the <br/>inquisitional  rehgious  and  philosophical  limitations  of  their  time  or  were  they  isolated <br/>transcendentalists  united  only  by  the  similarity  of  their  viewpoints  and  deductions?  Where  was  the <br/>&quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit, &quot;  in  which,  according  to  their  manifestoes,  they  met  once  a  year  to  plan  the <br/>future  activities  of  their  Order?  Who  was  the  mysterious  person  referred  to  as  &quot;Our  Illustrious  Father <br/>and  Brother  C.R.C.&quot;?  Did  those  three  letters  actually  stand  for  the  words  &quot;Christian  Rosie  Cross&quot;? <br/>Was  Christian  Rosencreutz,  the  supposed  author  of  the  Chymical  Nuptials,  the  same  person  who  with <br/>three  others  founded  &quot;The  Society  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;? <br/><br/>What  relationship  existed  between  Rosicrucianism  and  mediseval  Freemasonry?  Why  were  the <br/>destinies  of  these  two  organizations  so  closely  interwoven?  Is  the  &quot;Brotherhood  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  the <br/>much-sought-after  link  connecting  the  Freemasonry  of  the  Middle  Ages  with  the  symbolism  and <br/>mysticism  of  antiquity,  and  are  its  secrets  being  perpetuated  by  modern  Masonry?  Did  the  original <br/>Rosicrucian  Order  disintegrate  in  the  latter  part  of  the  eighteenth  century,  or  does  the  Society  still <br/>exist  as  an  organization,  maintaining  the  same  secreq?^  for  which  it  was  originally  famous?  What  was <br/>the  true  purpose  for  which  the  &quot;Brotherhood  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  was  formed?  Were  the  Rosicrucians  a <br/>religious  and  philosophic  brotherhood,  as  they  claimed  to  be,  or  were  their  avowed  tenets  a  blind  to <br/>conceal  the  true  object  of  the  Fraternity,  which  possibly  was  the  political  control  of  Europe?  These  are <br/>some  of  the  problems  involved  in  the  study  of  Rosicrucianism. <br/><br/>There  are  four  distinct  theories  regarding  the  Rosicrucian  enigma.  Each  is  the  result  of  a  careful <br/>consideration  of  the  evidence  by  scholars  who  have  spent  their  lives  ransacking  the  archives  of <br/>Hermetic  lore.  The  conclusions  reached  demonstrate  clearly  the  inadequacy  of  the  records  available <br/>concerning  the  genesis  and  early  activities  of  the  &quot;Brethren  of  the  Rose  Cross.&quot; <br/><br/>THE  FIRST  POSTULATE <br/><br/>It  is  assumed  that  the  Rosicrucian  Order  existed  historically  in  accordance  with  the  description  of  its <br/>foundation  and  subsequent  activities  published  in  its  manifesto,  the  Fama  Fraternitatis,  which  is <br/>believed  to  have  been  written  in  the  year  1610,  but  apparently  did  not  appear  in  print  until  1614, <br/>although  an  earlier  edition  is  suspected  by  some  authorities.  Intelligent  consideration  of  the  origin  of <br/>Rosicrucianism  requires  a  familiarity  with  the  contents  of  the  first  and  most  important  of  its <br/>documents.  The  Fama  Fraternitatis  begins  with  a  reminder  to  all  the  world  of  God's  goodness  and <br/>mercy,  and  it  warns  the  intelligentsia  that  their  egotism  and  covetousness  cause  them  to  follow  after <br/>false  prophets  and  to  ignore  the  true  knowledge  which  God  in  His  goodness  has  revealed  to  them. <br/>Hence,  a  reformation  is  necessary,  and  God  has  raised  up  philosophers  and  sages  for  this  purpose. <br/><br/>In  order  to  assist  in  bringing  about  the  reformation,  a  mysterious  person  called  &quot;The  Highly <br/>Illuminated  Father  C.R.C.,&quot;  a  German  by  birth,  descended  of  a  noble  family,  but  himself  a  poor  man, <br/>instituted  the  &quot;Secret  Society  of  the  Rose  Cross.&quot;  C.R.C.  was  placed  in  a  cloister  when  only  five  years <br/>of  age,  but  later  becoming  dissatisfied  with  its  educational  system,  he  associated  himself  with  a <br/>brother  of  Holy  Orders  who  was  setting  forth  on  a  pilgrimage  to  the  Holy  Land.  They  started  out <br/>together,  but  the  brother  died  at  Cyprus  and  C.R.C!  continued  alone  to  Damascus.  Poor  health <br/>prevented  him  from  reaching  Jerusalem,  so  he  remained  at  Damascus,  studying  with  the <br/>philosophers  who  dwelt  there. <br/><br/>While  pursuing  his  studies,  he  heard  of  a  group  of  mystics  and  Qabbalists  abiding  in  the  mystic <br/>Arabian  city  of  Damcar.  Giving  up  his  desire  to  visit  Jerusalem,  he  arranged  with  the  Arabians  for  his <br/><br/><br/>transportation  to  Damcar.  C.R.C.  was  but  sixteen  years  of  age  when  he  arrived  at  Damcar.  He  was <br/><br/>received  as  one  who  had  been  long  expected,  a  comrade  and  a  friend  in  philosophy,  and  was <br/>instructed  in  the  secrets  of  the  Arabian  adepts.  While  there,  C.R.C.  learned  the  Arabic  tongue  and <br/>translated  the  sacred  book  M  into  Latin;  and  upon  returning  to  Europe  he  brought  this  important <br/>volume  with  him. <br/><br/>After  studying  three  years  in  Damcar,  C.R.C.  departed  for  the  city  of  Fez,  where  the  Arabian <br/>magicians  declared  further  information  would  be  given  him.  At  Fez  he  was  instructed  how  to <br/>communicate  with  the  Elementary  inhabitants  [probably  the  Nature  spirits],  and  these  disclosed  to <br/>him  many  other  great  secrets  of  Nature.  While  the  philosophers  in  Fez  were  not  so  great  as  those  in <br/>Damcar,  the  previous  experiences  of  C.R.C.  enabled  him  to  distinguish  the  true  from  the  false  and <br/>thus  add  greatly  to  his  store  of  knowledge. <br/><br/>After  two  years  in  Fez,  C.R.C.  sailed  for  Spain,  carrying  with  him  many  treasures,  among  them  rare <br/>plants  and  animals  accumulated  during  his  wanderings.  He  fondly  hoped  that  the  learned  men  of <br/>Europe  would  receive  with  gratitude  the  rare  intellectual  and  material  treasures  which  he  had <br/>brought  for  their  consideration.  Instead  he  encountered  only  ridicule,  for  the  so-called  wise  were <br/>afraid  to  admit  their  previous  ignorance  lest  their  prestige  be  impaired.  At  this  point  in  the  narrative <br/>is  an  interpolation  stating  that  Paracelsus,  while  not  a  member  of  the  &quot;Fraternity  of  the  Rose  Cross,&quot; <br/>had  read  the  book  M  and  from  a  consideration  of  its  contents  had  secured  information  which  made <br/>him  the  foremost  physician  of  mediaeval  Europe. <br/><br/>Tired,  but  not  discouraged,  as  the  result  of  the  fruitlessness  of  his  efforts,  C.R.C.  returned  to  Germany, <br/>where  he  built  a  house  in  which  he  could  quietly  carry  on  his  study  and  research.  He  also <br/>manufactured  a  number  of  rare  scientific  instruments  for  research  purposes.  While  he  could  have <br/>made  himself  famous  had  he  cared  to  commercialize  his  knowledge,  he  preferred  the  companionship <br/>of  God  to  the  esteem  of  men. <br/><br/>After  five  years  of  retirement  he  decided  to  renew  his  struggle  for  a  reformation  of  the  arts  and <br/>sciences  of  his  day,  this  time  with  the  aid  of  a  few  trusted  friends.  He  sent  to  the  cloister  where  his <br/>early  training  had  been  received  and  called  to  himself  three  brethren,  whom  he  bound  by  an  oath  to <br/>preserve  inviolate  the  secrets  he  should  impart  and  to  write  down  for  the  sake  of  posterity  the <br/>information <br/><br/><br/>Sb*r^  halt  hbr;iii^  Hatfntvatfn, <br/>'3)4.  &#x00ab;&#x25a0;  HI  Is  aiiji  tnOkifErit  jKftitij <br/><br/>&#x25a0;&#x25a0;&#x25a0;ttajifitslati  UvUrf,  Tzr.cf  tu  hLt;&#x00ab;n' <br/>pUa.    fHitt  tit  Vfitt,  -J  Imitrc <br/><br/>J* <br/><br/><br/>Sif  iibttt[4fi  tit <br/><br/>Wn)t  !hm&#x00ab;  ^hn,  fimKn  tflimii  6H  Jtf <br/>OWk-f  r.&quot;*&#x00ab;^'  fl*  )if*&#x00ab;S&lt;i  tin,  tit <br/><br/>iq?  tir  i^rra^  t47     j&lt;n  t^nnj  jrtzBC^ <br/>Enil  aHiSiliSf  f  jrji:*&lt;;r[&lt;;&quot;trn,  eut  |1(  ^li <br/><br/>c;-**  V^ULT.  6niiinOn|l;JE!jnibi&#x00ab;?&lt;,  ^toamiir <br/><br/>TihlCTUfl.     flJ&#x00ab;1lCVi|l[&#x2122;iprl|t&#x00bb;  nil,  lilt  6nSifm <br/>^tn  $rinfl|il{l&#x00ab;  i^m!f  pmbn, <br/><br/><br/>THE  GOLDEN  AND  ROSY  CROSS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Geheime  Figuren  der  Rosenkreuzer. <br/><br/><br/>It  is  said  of  this  cross  that  it  is  made  of  spiritual  gold  and  that  each  Brother  wears  it  upon  his  breast.  It  bears  the <br/>alchemical  symbols  of  salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury;  also  a  star  of  the  planets;  and  around  it  are  the  four  words  FAITH, <br/>HOPE,  LOVE,  and  PATIENCE.  The  double-headed  eagle,  or  Phcenix,  subtly  foreshadows  the  ultimate  androgynous  state <br/>of  the  human  creature.  Rosicrucian  alchemy  was  not  concerned  with  metals  alone.  Man's  own  body  was  the  alchemical <br/>laboratory,  and  none  could  reach  Rosicrucian  adeptship  until  he  had  performed  the  supreme  experiment  of  transmutation <br/>by  changing  the  base  metals  of  ignorance  into  the  pure  gold  of  wisdom  and  understanding. <br/><br/><br/>p.  138 <br/><br/><br/>he  should  dictate.  These  four  founded  the  &quot;Fraternity  of  the  Rose  Cross.&quot;  They  prepared  its  secret <br/>cipher  language  and,  according  to  the  Fama,  a  great  dictionary  in  which  all  forms  of  wisdom  were <br/>classified  to  the  glorification  of  God.  They  also  began  the  work  of  transcribing  the  book  M,  but  found <br/>the  task  too  difficult  because  of  the  demands  of  the  great  numbers  of  sick  who  came  to  them  for <br/>healing. <br/><br/>Having  completed  a  newer  and  larger  building,  which  they  called  the  &quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit,&quot;  they <br/>decided  to  include  four  new  members  in  the  Fraternity,  thus  increasing  the  number  to  eight,  seven  of <br/>whom  were  German.  All  were  unmarried.  Working  industriously  together,  they  speedily  completed <br/><br/><br/>the  arduous  labor  of  preparing  the  documents,  instructions,  and  arcana  of  the  Order.  They  also  put <br/>the  house  called  &quot;Sancti  Spiritus&quot;  in  order. <br/><br/>They  then  decided  to  separate  and  visit  the  other  countries  of  the  earth,  not  only  that  their  wisdom <br/>might  be  given  to  others  who  deserved  it  but  also  that  they  might  check  and  correct  any  mistakes <br/>existing  in  their  own  system.  Before  separating,  the  Brethren  prepared  six  rules,  or  by-laws,  and  each <br/>bound  himself  to  obey  them.  The  first  rule  was  that  they  should  take  to  themselves  no  other  dignity  or <br/>credit  than  that  they  were  willing  to  heal  the  sick  without  charge.  The  second  was  that  from  that  time <br/>on  forever  they  should  wear  no  special  robe  or  garment,  but  should  dress  according  to  the  custom  of <br/>the  country  wherein  they  dwelt.  The  third  stated  that  every  year  upon  a  certain  day  they  should  meet <br/>in  the  &quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit,&quot;  or,  if  unable  to  do  so,  should  be  represented  by  an  epistle.  The <br/>fourth  decreed  that  each  member  should  search  for  a  worthy  person  to  succeed  him  at  his  own  demise. <br/>The  fifth  stated  that  the  letters  &quot;R.C.&quot;  should  be  their  seal,  mark,  and  character  from  that  time  onward. <br/>The  sixth  specified  that  the  Fraternity  should  remain  unknown  to  the  world  for  a  period  of  one <br/>hundred  years. <br/><br/>After  they  had  sworn  to  this  code  five  of  the  Brothers  departed  to  distant  lands,  and  a  year  later  two  of <br/>the  others  also  went  their  way,  leaving  Father  C.R.  C.  alone  in  the  &quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit.&quot;  Year <br/>after  year  they  met  with  great  joy,  for  they  had  quietly  and  sincerely  promulgated  their  doctrines <br/>among  the  wise  of  the  earth. <br/><br/>When  the  first  of  the  Order  died  in  England,  it  was  decided  that  the  burial  places  of  the  members <br/>should  be  secret.  Soon  afterward  Father  C.R.C.  called  the  remaining  six  together,  and  it  is  supposed <br/>that  then  he  prepared  his  own  symbolic  tomb.  The  Fama  records  that  none  of  the  Brothers  alive  at  the <br/>time  of  its  writing  knew  when  Father  C.R.C.  died  or  where  he  was  buried.  His  body  was  accidentally <br/>discovered  120  years  after  his  death  when  one  of  the  Brothers,  who  possessed  considerable <br/>architectural  skill,  decided  to  make  some  alterations  in  the  &quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit.&quot;  [It  is  only <br/>suspected  that  the  tomb  was  in  this  building.] <br/><br/>While  making  his  alterations,  the  Brother  discovered  a  memorial  tablet  upon  which  were  inscribed <br/>the  names  of  the  early  members  of  the  Order.  This  he  decided  to  transfer  to  a  more  imposing  chapel, <br/>for  at  that  time  no  one  knew  in  what  country  Father  C.R.C.  had  died,  this  information  having  been <br/>concealed  by  the  original  members.  In  attempting  to  remove  the  memorial  tablet,  which  was  held  in <br/>place  by  a  large  nail,  some  stones  and  plastering  were  broken  from  the  wall,  disclosing  a  door <br/>concealed  in  the  masonry.  The  members  of  the  Order  immediately  cleared  away  the  rest  of  the  debris <br/>and  uncovered  the  entrance  to  a  vault.  Upon  the  door  in  large  letters  were  the  words:  POST  CXX <br/>ANNOS  PATEBO.  This,  according  to  the  mystic  interpretation  of  the  Brethren,  meant,  &quot;In  120  years  I <br/>shall  come  forth.&quot; <br/><br/>The  following  morning  the  door  was  opened  and  the  members  entered  a  vault  with  seven  sides  and <br/>seven  corners,  each  side  five  feet  broad  and  eight  feet  high.  Although  the  sun  never  penetrated  this <br/>tomb,  it  was  brilliantly  illuminated  by  a  mysterious  light  in  the  ceiling.  In  the  center  was  a  circular <br/>altar,  upon  which  were  brass  plates  engraved  with  strange  characters.  In  each  of  the  seven  sides  was  a <br/>small  door  which,  upon  being  opened,  revealed  a  number  of  boxes  filled  with  books,  secret <br/>instructions,  and  the  supposedly  lost  arcanum  of  the  Fraternity. <br/><br/>Upon  moving  the  altar  to  one  side  a  brass  cover  was  disclosed.  Lifting  this  revealed  a  body, <br/>presumedly  that  of  C.R.C,  which,  although  it  had  lain  there  120  years,  was  as  well  preserved  as <br/>though  it  had  just  been  interred.  It  was  ornamented  and  attired  in  the  robes  of  the  Order,  and  in  one <br/>hand  was  clasped  a  mysterious  parchment  which,  next  to  the  Bible,  was  the  most  valued  possession  of <br/>the  Society.  After  thoroughly  investigating  the  contents  of  the  secret  chamber,  the  brass  plate  and <br/>altar  were  put  back  in  place,  the  door  of  the  vault  was  again  sealed,  and  the  Brothers  went  their <br/><br/><br/>respective  ways,  their  spirits  raised  and  their  faith  increased  by  the  miraculous  spectacle  which  they <br/>had  beheld. <br/><br/>The  document  ends  by  saying  in  effect,  &quot;In  accordance  with  the  will  of  Father  C.R.C.,  the  Fama  has <br/>been  prepared  and  sent  forth  to  the  wise  and  learned  of  all  Europe  in  five  languages,  that  all  may <br/>know  and  understand  the  secrets  of  the  august  Fraternity.  All  of  sincere  soul  who  labor  for  the  glory <br/>of  God  are  invited  to  communicate  with  the  Brethren  and  are  promised  that  their  appeal  shall  be <br/>heard,  regardless  of  where  they  are  or  how  the  messages  are  sent.  At  the  same  time,  those  of  selfish <br/>and  ulterior  motives  are  warned  that  only  sorrow  and  misery  will  attend  any  who  attempt  to  discover <br/>the  Fraternity  without  a  clean  heart  and  a  pure  mind.&quot; <br/><br/>Such,  in  brief,  is  the  story  of  the  Fama  Fraternitatis.  Those  who  accept  it  literally  regard  Father  C.R.C <br/>as  the  actual  founder  of  the  Brotherhood,  which  he  is  believed  to  have  organized  about  1400.  The  fact <br/>that  historical  corroboration  of  the  important  points  of  the  Fama  has  never  been  discovered  is  held <br/>against  this  theory.  There  is  no  proof  that  Father  C.R.C.  ever  approached  the  learned  men  of  Spain. <br/>The  mysterious  city  of  Damcar  cannot  be  found,  and  there  is  no  record  that  anywhere  in  Germany <br/>there  existed  a  place  where  great  numbers  of  the  halt  and  sick  came  and  were  mysteriously  healed.  A. <br/>E.  Waite's  The  Secret  Tradition  in  Freemasonry  contains  a  picture  of  Father  C.R.C.  showing  him  with <br/>a  long  beard  upon  his  breast,  sitting  before  a  table  upon  which  burns  a  candle.  One  hand  is <br/>supporting  his  head  and  the  other  is  resting  the  tip  of  its  index  finger  on  the  temple  of  a  human  skull. <br/>The  picture,  however  (see  plate  at  head  of  chapter),  proves  nothing.  Father  C.R.C.  was  never  seen  by <br/>other  than  members  of  his  own  Order,  and  they  did  not  preserve  a  description  of  him.  That  his  name <br/>was  Christian  Rosencreutz  is  most  improbable,  as  the  two  were  not  even  associated  until  the  writing <br/>of  the  Chymical  Nuptials. <br/><br/>THE  SECOND  POSTULATE <br/><br/>Those  Masonic  brethren  who  have  investigated  the  subject  accept  the  historical  existence  of  the <br/>&quot;Brotherhood  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  but  are  divided  concerning  the  origin  of  the  Order.  One  group  holds <br/>the  society  originated  in  mediaeval  Europe  as  an  outgrowth  of  alchemical  speculation.  Robert  Macoy, <br/>33&#x00b0;,  believes  that  Johann  Valentin  Andrese,  a  German  theologian,  was  the  true  founder,  and  he  also <br/>believes  it  possible  that  this  divine  merely  reformed  and  amplified  an  existing  society  which  had  been <br/>founded  by  Sir  Henry  Cornelius  Agrippa.  Some  believe  that  Rosicrucianism  represented  the  first <br/>European  invasion  of  Buddhist  and  Brahmin  culture.  Still  others  hold  the  opinion  that  the  &quot;Society  of <br/>the  Rose  Cross&quot;  was  founded  in  Egypt  during  n  the  philosophic  supremaq?^  of  that  empire,  and  that  it <br/>also  perpetuated  the  Mysteries  of  ancient  Persia  and  Chaldea. <br/><br/>In  his  Anacalypsis,  Godfrey  Higgins  writes:  &quot;The  Rosicrucians  of  Germany  are  quite  ignorant  of  their <br/>origin;  but,  by  tradition,  they  suppose  themselves  descendants  of  the  ancient  Egyptians,  Chaldeans, <br/>Magi,  and  Gymnosophists.&quot;  (The  last  was  a  name  given  by  the  followers  of  Alexander  the  Great  to  a <br/>caste  of  naked  Wise  Men  whom  they  found  meditating  along  the  river  banks  in  India.)  The  consensus <br/>among  these  factions  is  that  the  story  of  Father  C.R.C.,  like  the  Masonic  legend  of  Hiram  Abiff,  is  an <br/>allegory  and  should  not  be  considered  literally.  A  similar  problem  has  confronted  students  of  the <br/>Bible,  who  have  found  not  only  difficult,  but  in  the  majority  of  cases  impossible,  their  efforts  to <br/>substantiate  the  historical  interpretation  of  the  Scriptures. <br/><br/>Admitting  the  existence  of  the  Rosicrucians  as  a  secret  society  with  both  philosophic  and  political <br/>ends,  it  is  remarkable  that  an  organization  with  members  in  all  parts  of  Europe  could  maintain <br/>absolute  secrecy  throughout  the  centuries.  Nevertheless,  the  &quot;Brothers  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  were <br/>apparently  able  to  accomplish  this.  A  great  number  of  scholars  and  philosophers,  among  them  Sir <br/>Francis  Bacon  and  Wolfgang  von  Goethe,  have  been  suspected  of  affiliation  with  the  Order,  but  their <br/>connection  has  not  been  established  to  the  satisfaction  of  prosaic  historians.  Pseudo-Rosicrucians <br/><br/><br/>abounded,  but  the  true  members  of  the  &quot;Ancient  and  Secret  Order  of  The  Unknown  Philosophers&quot; <br/>have  successfully  lived  up  to  their  name;  to  this  day  they  remain  unknovm. <br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages  a  number  of  tracts  appeared,  purporting  to  be  from  the  pens  of  Rosicrucians. <br/>Many  of  them,  however,  were  spurious,  being  issued  for  their  self-aggrandizement  by  unscrupulous <br/>persons  who  used  the  revered  and  magic  name  Rosicrucian  in  the  hope  of  gaining  religious  or <br/>political  power.  This  has  greatly  complicated <br/><br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIED  ROSE. <br/><br/>The  original  symbol  of  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity  was  a  hieroglyphic  rose  crucified  upon  a  cross.  The  cross  was  often <br/>raised  upon  a  three-stepped  Calvary.  Occasionally  the  symbol  of  a  cross  rising  from  a  rose  was  used  in  connection  with <br/>their  activities.  The  Rosicrucian  rose  was  drawn  upon  the  Round  Table  of  King  Arthur,  and  is  the  central  motif  for  the <br/>links  forming  the  chain  from  which  the  &quot;Great  George&quot;  is  suspended  among  the  jewels  of  The  Order  of  the  Garter. <br/>Hargrave  Jennings  suspects  this  Order  of  having  some  connection  with  the  Rosicrucians. <br/><br/>P139 <br/><br/>the  work  of  investigating  the  Society.  One  group  of  pseudo-Rosicrucians  went  so  far  as  to  supply  its <br/>members  with  a  black  cord  by  which  they  were  to  know  each  other,  and  warned  them  that  if  they <br/>broke  their  vow  of  secrecy  the  cord  would  be  used  to  strangle  them.  Few  of  the  principles  of <br/>Rosicrucianism  have  been  preserved  in  literature,  for  the  original  Fraternity  published  only <br/>fragmentary  accounts  of  its  principles  and  activities. <br/><br/>In  his  Secret  Symbols  of  the  Rosicrucians,  Dr.  Franz  Hartmann  describes  the  Fraternity  as  &quot;A  secret <br/>society  of  men  possessing  superhuman&#x2014;if  not  supernatural&#x2014;powers;  they  were  said  to  be  able  to <br/>prophesy  future  events,  to  penetrate  into  the  deepest  mysteries  of  Nature,  to  transform  Iron,  Copper, <br/>Lead,  or  Mercury  into  Gold,  to  prepare  an  Elixir  of  Life,  or  Universal  Panacea,  by  the  use  of  which <br/>they  could  preserve  their  youth  and  manhood;  and  moreover  it  was  believed  that  they  could <br/>command  the  Elemental  Spirits  of  Nature,  and  knew  the  secret  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  a <br/>substance  which  rendered  him  who  possessed  it  all-powerful,  immortal,  and  supremely  wise.&quot; <br/><br/>The  same  author  further  defines  a  Rosicrucian  as  &quot;A  person  who  by  the  process  of  spiritual  awakening <br/>has  attained  a  practical  knowledge  of  the  secret  significance  of  the  Rose  and  the  Cross.  *  *  *  To  call  a <br/>person  a  Rosicrucian  does  not  make  him  one,  nor  does  the  act  of  calling  a  person  a  Christian  make <br/>him  a  Christ.  The  real  Rosicrucian  or  Mason  cannot  be  made;  he  must  grow  to  be  one  by  the <br/>expansion  and  unfoldment  of  the  divine  power  within  his  own  heart.  The  inattention  to  this  truth  is <br/>the  cause  that  many  churches  and  secret  societies  are  far  from  being  that  which  their  names  express.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>The  symbolic  principles  of  Rosicrucianism  are  so  profound  that  even  today  they  are  little  appreciated. <br/><br/>Their  charts  and  diagrams  are  concerned  with  weighty  cosmic  principles  which  they  treat  with  a <br/>philosophic  understanding  decidedly  refreshing  when  compared  with  the  orthodox  narrowness <br/>prevalent  in  their  day.  According  to  the  available  records,  the  Rosicrucians  were  bound  together  by <br/>mutual  aspirations  rather  than  by  the  laws  of  a  fraternity.  The  &quot;Brothers  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  are <br/>believed  to  have  lived  unobtrusively,  laboring  industriously  in  trades  and  professions,  disclosing  their <br/>secret  affiliation  to  no  one&#x2014; in  many  cases  not  even  to  their  own  families.  After  the  death  of  C.R.C., <br/>most  of  the  Brethren  apparently  had  no  central  meeting  place.  Whatever  initiatory  ritual  the  Order <br/>possessed  was  so  closely  guarded  that  it  has  never  been  revealed.  Doubtless  it  was  couched  in <br/>chemical  terminology. <br/><br/>Efforts  to  join  the  Order  were  apparently  futile,  for  the  Rosicrucians  always  chose  their  disciples. <br/>Having  agreed  on  one  who  they  believed  would  do  honor  to  their  illustrious  fraternity,  they <br/>communicated  with  him  in  one  of  many  mysterious  ways.  He  might  receive  a  letter,  either <br/>anonymous  or  with  a  peculiar  seal,  usually  bearing  the  letters  &quot;C.R.C.  &quot;or  &quot;R.C.  &quot;upon  it.  He  would  be <br/>instructed  to  go  to  a  certain  place  at  an  appointed  time.  What  was  disclosed  to  him  he  never  revealed, <br/>although  in  many  cases  his  later  writings  showed  that  a  new  influence  had  come  into  his  life, <br/>deepening  his  understanding  and  broadening  his  intellect.  A  few  have  written  allegorically  concerning <br/>what  they  beheld  when  in  the  august  presence  of  the  &quot;Brethren  of  the  Rose  Cross.&quot; <br/><br/>Alchemists  were  sometimes  visited  in  their  laboratories  by  mysterious  strangers,  who  delivered <br/>learned  discourses  concerning  the  secret  processes  of  the  Hermetic  arts  and,  after  disclosing  certain <br/>processes,  departed,  leaving  no  trace.  Others  declared  that  the  &quot;Brothers  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot; <br/>communicated  with  them  through  dreams  and  visions,  revealing  the  secrets  of  Hermetic  wisdom  to <br/>them  while  they  were  asleep.  Having  been  instructed,  the  candidate  was  bound  to  secrecy  not  only <br/>concerning  the  chemical  formulae  which  had  been  disclosed  to  him  but  also  concerning  the  method  by <br/>which  he  had  secured  them.  While  these  nameless  adepts  were  suspected  of  being  &quot;Brothers  of  the <br/>Rose  Cross,&quot;  it  could  never  be  proved  who  they  were,  and  those  visited  could  only  conjecture. <br/><br/>Many  suspect  the  Rosicrucian  rose  to  be  a  conventionalization  of  the  Egyptian  and  Hindu  lotus <br/>blossom,  with  the  same  symbolic  meaning  as  this  more  ancient  symbol.  The  Divine  Comedy  stamps <br/>Dante  Alighieri  as  being  familiar  with  the  theory  of  Rosicrucianism.  Concerning  this  point,  Albert <br/>Pike  in  his  Morals  and  Dogma  makes  this  significant  statement:  &quot;His  Hell  is  but  a  negative  Purgatory. <br/>His  heaven  is  composed  of  a  series  of  Kabalistic  circles,  divided  by  a  cross,  like  the  Pantacle  of  Ezekiel. <br/>In  the  center  of  this  cross  blooms  a  rose,  and  we  see  the  symbol  of  the  Adepts  of  the  Rose-Croix  for <br/>the  first  time  publicly  expounded  and  almost  categorically  explained.&quot; <br/><br/>Doubt  has  always  existed  as  to  whether  the  name  Rosicrucian  came  from  the  symbol  of  the  rose  and <br/>cross,  or  whether  this  was  merely  a  blind  to  deceive  the  uninformed  and  further  conceal  the  true <br/>meaning  of  the  Order.  Godfrey  Higgins  believes  that  the  word  Rosicrucian  is  not  derived  from  the <br/>flower  but  from  the  word  Ros,  which  means  dew.  It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  the  word  Ras <br/>means  wisdom,  while  Rus  is  translated  concealment.  Doubtless  all  of  these  meanings  have <br/>contributed  to  Rosicrucian  symbolism. <br/><br/>A.  E.  Waite  holds  with  Godfrey  Higgins  that  the  process  of  forming  the  Philosopher's  Stone  with  the <br/>aid  of  dew  is  the  secret  concealed  within  the  name  Rosicrucian.  It  is  possible  that  the  dew  referred  to <br/>is  a  mysterious  substance  within  the  human  brain,  closely  resembling  the  description  given  by <br/>alchemists  of  the  dew  which,  falling  from  heaven,  redeemed  the  earth.  The  cross  is  symbolic  of  the <br/>human  body,  and  the  two  symbols  together &#x2014;the  rose  on  the  cross&#x2014;signify  that  the  soul  of  man  is <br/>crucified  upon  the  body,  where  it  is  held  by  three  nails. <br/><br/>It  is  probable  that  Rosicrucian  symbolism  is  a  perpetuation  of  the  secret  tenets  of  the  Egyptian <br/>Hermes,  and  that  the  Society  of  Unknown  Philosophers  is  the  true  link  connecting  modern  Masonry, <br/><br/><br/>with  its  mass  of  symbols,  to  ancient  Egyptian  Hermeticism,  the  source  of  that  symboHsm.  In  his <br/>Doctrine  and  Literature  of  the  Kabalah,  A.  E.  Waite  makes  this  important  observation:  &quot;There  are <br/>certain  indications  which  point  to  a  possible  connection  between  Masonry  and  Rosicrucianism,  and <br/>this,  if  admitted,  would  constitute  the  first  link  in  its  connection  with  the  past.  The  evidence  is, <br/>however,  inconclusive,  or  at  least  unextricated.  Freemasonry  per  se,  in  spite  of  the  affinity  with <br/>mysticism  which  I  have  just  mentioned,  has  never  exhibited  any  mystic  character,  nor  has  it  a  clear <br/>notion  how  it  came  by  its  symbols.&quot; <br/><br/>Many  of  those  connected  with  the  development  of  Freemasonry  were  suspected  of  being  Rosicrucians; <br/>some,  as  in  the  case  of  Robert  Fludd,  even  wrote  defenses  of  this  organization.  Frank  C.  Higgins,  a <br/>modern  Masonic  symbolist,  writes:  &quot;Doctor  Ashmole,  a  member  of  this  fraternity  [Rosicrucian],  is <br/>revered  by  Masons  as  one  of  the  founders  of  the  first  Grand  Lodge  in  London.&quot;  (See  Ancient <br/>Freemasonry.)  Elias  Ashmole  is  but  one  of  many  intellectual  links  connecting  Rosicrucianism  with <br/>the  genesis  of  Freemasonry.  The  Encyclopaedia  Britannica  notes  that  Elias  Ashmole  was  initiated <br/>into  the  Freemasonic  Order  in  1646,  and  further  states  that  he  was  &quot;the  first  gentleman,  or  amateur, <br/>to  be  'accepted'.&quot; <br/><br/>On  this  same  subject,  Papus,  in  his  Tarot  of  the  Bohemians,  has  written:  &quot;We  must  not  forger  that  the <br/>Rosicrucians  were  the  Initiators  of  Leibnitz,  and  the  founders  of  actual  Freemasonry  through <br/>Ashmole.&quot;  If  the  founders  of  Freemasonry  were  initiated  into  the  Great  Arcanum  of  Egypt&#x2014;and  the <br/>symbolism  of  modem  Masonry  would  indicate  that  such  was  the  case&#x2014;then  it  is  reasonable  to <br/>suppose  that  they  secured  their  information  from  a  society  whose  existence  they  admitted  and  which <br/>was  duly  qualified  to  teach  them  these  symbols  and  allegories. <br/><br/>One  theory  concerning  the  two  Orders  is  to  the  effect  that  Freemasonry  was  an  outgrowth  of <br/>Rosicrucianism;  in  other  words,  that  the  &quot;Unknown  Philosophers&quot;  became  known  through  an <br/>organization  which  they  created  to  serve  them  in  the  material  world.  The  story  goes  on  to  relate  that <br/>the  Rosicrucian  adepts  became  dissatisfied  with  their  progeny  and  silently  withdrew  from  the <br/>Masonic  hierarchy,  leaving  behind  their  symbolism  and  allegories,  but  carrying  away  the  keys  by <br/>which  the  locked  symbols  could  be  made  to  give  tip  their  secret  meanings.  Speculators  have  gone  so <br/>far  as  to  state  that,  in  their  opinion,  modern  Freemasonry  has  completely  absorbed  Rosicrucianism <br/>and  succeeded  it  as  the  world's  greatest  secret  society.  Other  minds  of  equal  learning  declare  that  the <br/>Rosicrucian  Brotherhood  still  exists,  preserving  its  individuality  as  the  result  of  having  withdrawn <br/>from  the  Masonic  Order. <br/><br/>According  to  a  widely  accepted  tradition,  the  headquarters  of  the  Rosicrucian  Order  is  near  Carlsbad, <br/>in  Austria  (see  Doctor  Franz  Hartmann).  Another  version  has  it  that  a  mysterious  school,  resembling <br/>in  general  principles  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity,  which  calls  itself  &quot;The  Bohemian  Brothers,&quot;  still <br/>maintains  its  individuality  in  the  Schwarzwald  (Black  Forest)  of  Germany.  One  thing  is  certain:  with <br/>the  rise  of  Freemasonry,  the  Rosicrucian  Order  in  Europe  practically  disappeared,  and <br/>notwithstanding  existing  statements  to  the  contrary,  it  is  certain  that  the  18th  degree  (commonly <br/>known  as  the  Rose-Croix)  perpetuates  many  of  the  symbols  of  the  Rosicrucian  Fire  Alchemists. <br/><br/>In  an  anonymous  unpublished  manuscript  of  the  eighteenth  century  bearing  the  earmarks  of <br/>Rosicrucian  Qabbalism  appears  this <br/><br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>THE  ROSICRUCIAN  ROSE. <br/><br/>From  Geheime  Figuren  der  Rosenkreuzer. <br/><br/>The  rose  is  a  yonic  symbol  associated  with  generation,  fecundity,  and  purity.  The  fact  that  flowers  blossom  by  unfolding <br/>has  caused  them  to  be  chosen  as  symbolic  of  spiritual  unfoldment.  The  red  color  of  the  rose  refers  to  the  blood  of  Christ, <br/>and  the  golden  heart  concealed  within  the  midst  of  the  flower  corresponds  to  the  spiritual  gold  concealed  within  the <br/>human  nature.  The  number  of  its  petals  being  ten  is  also  a  subtle  reminder  of  the  perfect  Pythagorean  number.  The  rose <br/>symbolizes  the  heart,  and  the  heart  has  always  been  accepted  by  Christians  as  emblematic  of  the  virtues  of  love  and <br/>compassion,  as  well  as  of  the  nature  of  Christ&#x2014;the  personification  of  these  virtues.  The  rose  as  a  religious  emblem  is  of <br/>great  antiquity.  It  was  accepted  by  the  Greeks  as  the  symbol  of  the  sunrise,  or  of  the  coming  of  dawn.  In  his <br/>Metamorphosis,  or  Golden  Ass,  Apuleius,  turned  into  a  donkey  because  of  his  foolishness,  regained  his  human  shape  by <br/>eating  a  sacred  rose  given  to  him  by  the  Egyptian  priests. <br/><br/>The  presence  of  a  hieroglyphic  rose  upon  the  escutcheon  of  Martin  Luther  has  been  the  basis  of  much  speculation  as  to <br/>whether  any  connection  existed  between  his  Reformation  and  the  secret  activities  of  the  Rose  Cross. <br/><br/>p.  140 <br/><br/>Statement:  &quot;Yet  will  I  now  give  the  over-wise  world  a  paradox  to  be  solved,  namely,  that  some <br/>illuminated  men  have  undertaken  to  found  Schools  of  Wisdom  in  Europe  and  these  for  some  peculiar <br/>reason  have  called  themselves  Fratres  Rosa:  Crucis.  But  soon  afterwards  came  false  schools  into <br/>existence  and  corrupted  the  good  intentions  of  these  wise  men.  Therefore,  the  Order  no  longer  exists <br/>as  most  people  would  understand  existence,  and  as  this  Fraternity  of  the  Seculo  Fili  call  themselves <br/>Brothers  of  the  Rosie  Cross,  so  also  will  they  in  the  Seculo  Spiritus  Sancti  call  themselves  Brothers  of <br/>the  Lily  Cross  and  the  Knights  of  the  White  Lion.  Then  will  the  Schools  of  Wisdom  begin  again  to <br/>blossom,  but  why  the  first  one  chose  their  name  and  why  the  others  shall  also  choose  theirs,  only <br/>those  can  solve  who  have  understanding  grounded  in  Nature.&quot; <br/><br/>Political  aspirations  of  the  Rosicrucians  were  expressed  through  the  activities  of  Sir  Francis  Bacon, <br/>the  Comte  de  St. -Germain,  and  the  Comte  di  Cagliostro.  The  last  named  is  suspected  of  having  been <br/>an  emissary  of  the  Knights  Templars,  a  society  deeply  involved  in  transcendentalism,  as  Eliphas  Levi <br/>has  noted.  There  is  a  popular  supposition  to  the  effect  that  the  Rosicrucians  were  at  least  partial <br/>instigators  of  the  French  Revolution.  (Note  particularly  the  introduction  to  Lord  Bulwer-Ljrtton's <br/>Rosicrucian  novel  Zanoni.) <br/><br/>THE  THIRD  POSTULATE <br/><br/>The  third  theory  takes  the  form  of  a  sweeping  denial  of  Rosicrucianism,  asserting  that  the  so-called <br/>original  Order  never  had  any  foundation  in  fact  but  was  entirely  a  product  of  imagination.  This <br/>viewpoint  is  best  expressed  by  a  number  of  questions  which  are  still  being  asked  by  investigators  of <br/>this  elusive  group  of  metaphysicians.  Was  the  &quot;Brotherhood  of  the  Rose  Cross&quot;  merely  a  mythical <br/>institution  created  in  the  fertile  mind  of  some  literary  cynic  for  the  purpose  of  deriding  the  alchemical <br/>and  Hermetic  sciences?  Did  the  &quot;House  of  the  Holy  Spirit&quot;  ever  exist  outside  the  imagination  of  some <br/>mediaeval  mystic?  Was  the  whole  Rosicrucian  story  a  satire  to  ridicule  the  gullibility  of  scholastic <br/><br/><br/>Europe?  Was  the  mysterious  Father  C.R.C.  a  product  of  the  Hterary  genius  of  Johann  Valentin <br/><br/>Andrese,  or  another  of  similar  mind,  who,  attempting  to  score  alchemical  and  Hermetic  philosophy, <br/>unwittingly  became  a  great  power  in  furthering  the  cause  of  its  promulgation?  That  at  least  one  of  the <br/>early  documents  of  the  Rosicrucians  was  from  the  pen  of  Andreee  there  is  little  doubt,  but  for  just <br/>what  purpose  he  compiled  it  still  remains  a  matter  of  speculation.  Did  Andreas  himself  receive  from <br/>some  unknown  person,  or  persons,  instructions  to  be  carried  out?  If  he  wrote  the  Chymical  Nuptials <br/>of  Christian  Rosencreutz  when  only  fifteen  years  old,  was  he  overshadowed  in  the  preparation  of  that <br/>book? <br/><br/>To  these  vital  questions  no  answers  are  forthcoming.  A  number  of  persons  accepted  the  magnificent <br/>imposture  of  Andrese  as  absolute  truth.  It  is  maintained  by  many  that,  as  a  consequence,  numerous <br/>pseudo-societies  sprang  up,  each  asserting  that  it  was  the  organization  concerning  which  the  Fama <br/>Fraternitatis  and  the  Confessio  Fraternitatis  were  written.  Beyond  doubt  there  are  many  spurious <br/>orders  in  existence  today;  but  few  of  them  can  offer  valid  claims  that  their  history  dates  back  farther <br/>than  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth  century. <br/><br/>The  mystery  associated  with  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity  has  resulted  in  endless  controversy.  Many <br/>able  minds,  notable  among  them  Eugenius  Philalethes,  Michael  Maier,  John  Heydon,  and  Robert <br/>Fludd,  defended  the  concrete  existence  of  &quot;The  Society  of  Unknown  Philosophers.&quot;  Others  equally <br/>qualified  have  asserted  it  to  be  of  fraudulent  origin  and  doubtful  existence.  Eugenius  Philalethes, <br/>while  dedicating  books  to  the  Order,  and  himself  writing  an  extended  exposition  of  its  principles, <br/>disclaims  all  personal  connection  with  it.  Many  others  have  done  likewise. <br/><br/>Some  are  of  the  opinion  that  Sir  Francis  Bacon  had  a  hand  in  the  writing  of  the  Fama  and  Confessio <br/>Fraternitatis,  on  the  basis  that  the  rhetorical  style  of  these  works  is  similar  to  that  of  Bacon's  New <br/>Atlantis.  They  also  contend  that  certain  statements  in  the  latter  work  point  to  an  acquaintance  with <br/>Rosicrucian  symbology.  The  elusiveness  of  the  Rosicrucians  has  caused  them  to  be  favorite  subject's <br/>for  literary  works.  Outstanding  among  the  romances  which  have  been  woven  around  them  is  Zanoni. <br/>The  author,  Lord  Bulwer-Lytton,  is  regarded  by  some  as  a  member  of  the  Order,  while  others  assert <br/>that  he  applied  for  membership  but  was  rejected.  Pope's  Rape  of  the  Lock,  &amp;c.  Comte  de  Gabalis  by <br/>Abbe  de  Villars,  and  essays  by  De  Quincy,  Hartmann,  Jennings,  Mackenzie,  and  others,  are  examples <br/>of  Rosicrucian  literature.  Although  the  existence  of  these  mediaeval  Rosicrucians  is  difficult  to  prove, <br/>sufficient  evidence  is  at  hand  to  make  it  extremely  probable  that  there  existed  in  Germany,  and <br/>afterwards  in  France,  Italy,  England,  and  other  European  countries,  a  secret  society  of  illuminated <br/>savants  who  made  contributions  of  great  import  to  the  sum  of  human  knowledge,  while  maintaining <br/>absolute  secrecy  concerning  their  personalities  and  their  organization. <br/><br/>THE  FOURTH  POSTULATE <br/><br/>The  apparent  incongruities  of  the  Rosicrucian  controversy  have  also  been  accounted  for  by  a  purely <br/>transcendental  explanation.  There  is  evidence  that  early  writers  were  acquainted  with  such  a <br/>supposition&#x2014;which,  however,  was  popularized  only  after  it  had  been  espoused  by  Theosophy.  This <br/>theory  asserts  that  the  Rosicrucians  actually  possessed  all  the  supernatural  powers  with  which  they <br/>were  credited;  that  they  were  in  reality  citizens  of  two  worlds:  that,  while  they  had  physical  bodies  for <br/>expression  on  the  material  plane,  they  were  also  capable,  through  the  instructions  they  received  from <br/>the  Brotherhood,  of  functioning  in  a  mysterious  ethereal  body  not  subject  to  the  limitations  of  time  or <br/>distance.  By  means  of  this  &quot;astral  form&quot;  they  were  able  to  function  in  the  invisible  realm  of  Nature, <br/>and  in  this  realm,  beyond  reach  of  the  profane,  their  temple  was  located. <br/><br/>According  to  this  viewpoint,  the  true  Rosicrucian  Brotherhood  consisted  of  a  limited  number  of <br/>highly  developed  adepts,  or  initiates,  those  of  the  higher  degrees  being  no  longer  subject  to  the  laws  of <br/>mortality;  candidates  were  accepted  into  the  Order  only  after  long  periods  of  probation;  adepts <br/>possessed  the  secret  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone  and  knew  the  process  of  transmuting  the  base  metals <br/><br/><br/>into  gold,  but  taught  that  these  were  only  allegorical  terms  concealing  the  true  mystery  of  human <br/>regeneration  through  the  transmutation  of  the  &quot;base  elements&quot;  of  man's  lower  nature  into  the  &quot;gold&quot; <br/>of  intellectual  and  spiritual  realization.  According  to  this  theory,  those  who  have  sought  to  record  the <br/>events  of  importance  in  connection  with  the  Rosicrucian  controversy  have  invariably  failed  because <br/>they  approached  their  subject  from  a  purely  physical  or  materialistic  angle. <br/><br/>These  adepts  were  believed  to  have  been  able  to  teach  man  how  to  function  away  from  his  physical <br/>body  at  will  by  assisting  him  to  remove  the  &quot;rose  from  the  cross.&quot;  They  taught  that  the  spiritual  nature <br/>was  attached  to  the  material  form  at  certain  points,  symbolized  by  the  &quot;nails&quot;  of  the  crucifixion;  but <br/>by  three  alchemical  initiations  which  took  place  in  the  spiritual  world,  in  the  true  Temple  of  the  Rose <br/>Cross,  they  were  able  to  &quot;draw&quot;  these  nails  and  permit  the  divine  nature  of  man  to  come  down  from <br/>its  cross.  They  concealed  the  processes  by  which  this  was  accomplished  under  three  alchemical <br/>metaphoric  expressions:  &quot;The  Casting  of  the  Molten  Sea,&quot;  &quot;The  Making  of  the  Rose  Diamond,&quot;  and <br/>&quot;The  Achieving  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone.&quot; <br/><br/>While  the  intellectualist  flounders  among  contradictory  theories,  the  mystic  treats  the  problem  in  an <br/>entirely  different  manner.  He  believes  that  the  true  Rosicrucian  Fraternity,  consisting  of  a  school  of <br/>supermen  (not  unlike  the  fabled  Mahatmas  of  India),  is  an  institution  existing  not  in  the  visible  world <br/>bur  in  its  spiritual  counterpart,  which  he  sees  fit  to  call  the  &quot;inner  planes  of  Nature&quot;;  that  the  Brothers <br/>can  be  reached  only  by  those  who  are  capable  of  transcending  the  limitations  of  the  material  world. <br/>To  substantiate  their  viewpoint,  these  mystics  cite  the  following  significant  statement  from  the <br/>Confessio  Fraternitatis:  &quot;A  thousand  times  the  unworthy  may  clamour,  a  thousand  times  may <br/>present  themselves,  yet  God  hath  commanded  our  ears  that  they  should  hear  none  of  them,  and  hath <br/>so  compassed  us  about  with  His  clouds  that  unto  us.  His  servants,  no  violence  can  be  done;  wherefore <br/>now  no  longer  are  we  beheld  by  human  eyes,  unless  they  have  received  strength  borrowed  from  the <br/>eagle.&quot;  In  mysticism  the  eagle  is  a  symbol  of  initiation  (the  spinal  Spirit  Fire),  and  by  this  is  explained <br/>the  inability  of  the  unregenerated  world  to  understand  the  Secret  Order  of  the  Rose  Cross. <br/><br/>Those  professing  this  theory  regard  the  Comte  de  St.-Germain  as  their  highest  adept  and  assert  that <br/>he  and  Christian  Rosencreutz  were  one  and  the  same  individual.  They  accept  fire  as  their  universal <br/>symbol  because  it  was  the  one  element  by  means  of  which  they  could  control  the  metals.  They <br/>declared  themselves  the  descendants  of  Tubal-cain  and  Hiram  Abiff,  and  that  the  purpose  of  their <br/>existence  was  to  preserve  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  through  ages  of  materiality.  &quot;The  Gnostic  sects, <br/>the  Arabs,  Alchemists,  Templars,  Rosicrucians,  and  lastly  the  Freemasons,  form  the  Western  chain  in <br/>the  transmission  of  occult  science.&quot;  (See  The  Tarot  of  the  Bohemians  translated  by  A.  E.  Waite  from <br/>the  French  of  Papus.) <br/><br/>Max  Heindel,  the  Christian  mystic,  described  the  Rosicrucian  Temple  as  an  &quot;etheric  structure&quot; <br/>located  in  and  around  the  home  of  a  European  country  gentleman.  He  believed  that  this  invisible <br/>building  would  ultimately  be  moved  to  the  American  continent.  Mr.  Heindel  referred  to  the <br/>Rosicrucian  Initiates  as  so  advanced  in  the  science  of  life  that  &quot;death  had  forgotten  them.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  CREST  OF  JOHANN  VALENTIN  ANDRKE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Chymische  Hochzeit. <br/><br/><br/>The  reference  to  four  red  roses  and  a  white  cross  in  the  Chymical  Marriage  of  Christian  Rosencreutz  identified  Johann <br/>Valentin  Andreae  as  its  author,  for  his  family  crest,  shown  above,  consisted  of  four  red  roses  and  a  white  cross. <br/><br/><br/>p.  141 <br/><br/><br/>Rosicrucian  Doctrines  and  Tenets <br/><br/>TRUSTWORTHY  information  is  unavailable  concerning  the  actual  philosophical  beliefs,  political <br/>aspirations,  and  humanitarian  activities  of  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity.  Today,  as  of  old,  the  mysteries <br/>of  the  Society  are  preserved  inviolate  by  virtue  of  their  essential  nature;  and  attempts  to  interpret <br/>Rosicrucian  philosophy  are  but  speculations,  anj^hing  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding. <br/><br/>Evidence  points  to  the  probable  existence  of  two  distinct  Rosicrucian  bodies:  an  inner  organization <br/>whose  members  never  revealed  their  identity  or  teachings  to  the  world,  and  an  outer  body  under  the <br/>supervision  of  the  inner  group.  In  all  probability,  the  symbolic  tomb  of  Christian  Rosencreutz,  Knight <br/>of  the  Golden  Stone,  was  in  reality  this  outer  body,  the  spirit  of  which  is  in  a  more  exalted  sphere.  For <br/>a  period  of  more  than  a  century  subsequent  to  1614,  the  outer  body  circulated  tracts  and  manifestoes <br/>under  either  its  own  name  or  the  names  of  various  initiated  members.  The  purpose  of  these  writings <br/>was  apparently  to  confuse  and  mislead  investigators,  and  thus  effectively  to  conceal  the  actual  designs <br/>of  the  Fraternity. <br/><br/>When  Rosicrucianism  became  the  philosophical  &quot;fad&quot;  of  the  seventeenth  century,  numerous <br/>documents  on  the  subject  were  also  circulated  for  purely  commercial  purposes  by  impostors  desirous <br/>of  capitalizing  its  popularity.  The  cunningly  contrived  artifices  of  the  Fraternity  itself  and  the <br/>blundering  literary  impostures  of  charlatans  formed  a  double  veil  behind  which  the  inner <br/>organization  carried  on  its  activities  in  a  manner  totally  dissimilar  to  its  purposes  and  principles  as <br/>publicly  disseminated.  The  Fratres  Rosa  Crucis  naively  refer  to  the  misunderstandings  which  they <br/>have  for  obvious  reasons  permitted  to  exist  concerning  themselves  as  being  &quot;clouds&quot;  within  which <br/>they  labor  and  behind  which  they  are  concealed. <br/><br/>An  inkling  of  the  substance  of  Rosicrucianism~its  esoteric  doctrines&#x2014;can  be  gleaned  from  an  analysis <br/>of  its  shadow&#x2014;its  exoteric  writings.  In  one  of  the  most  important  of  their  &quot;clouds,&quot;  the  Confessio <br/>Fraternitatis,  the  Brethren  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  seek  to  justify  their  existence  and  explain  (?)  the <br/>purposes  and  activities  of  their  Order.  In  its  original  form  the  Confessio  is  divided  into  fourteen <br/>chapters,  which  are  here  epitomized. <br/><br/>CONFESSIO  FRATERNITATIS  R.  C.  AD  ERUDITOS  EUROP^^ <br/><br/>Chapter  I.  Do  not  through  hasty  judgment  or  prejudice  misinterpret  the  statements  concerning  our <br/>Fraternity  published  in  our  previous  manifesto&#x2014; the  Fama  Fraternitatis.  Jehovah,  beholding  the <br/>decadence  of  civilization,  seeks  to  redeem  humanity  by  revealing  to  the  willing  and  by  thrusting  upon <br/>the  reluctant  those  secrets  which  previously  He  had  reserved  for  His  elect.  By  this  wisdom  the  godly <br/>shall  be  saved,  but  the  sorrows  of  the  ungodly  shall  be  multiplied.  While  the  true  purpose  of  our <br/>Order  was  set  forth  in  the  Fama  Fraternitatis,  misunderstandings  have  arisen  through  which  we  have <br/>been  falsely  accused  of  heresy  and  treason.  In  this  document  we  hope  so  to  clarify  our  position  that <br/>the  learned  of  Europe  will  be  moved  to  join  with  us  in  the  dissemination  of  divine  knowledge <br/>according  to  the  will  of  our  illustrious  founder. <br/><br/>Chapter  II.  While  it  is  alleged  by  many  that  the  philosophic  cide  (sic.  jbh)  of  our  day  is  sound,  we <br/>declare  it  to  be  false  and  soon  to  die  of  its  own  inherent  weakness,  just  as  Nature,  however,  provides  a <br/>remedy  for  each  new  disease  that  manifests  itself,  so  our  Fraternity  has  provided  a  remedy  for  the <br/>infirmities  of  the  world's  philosophic  system.  The  secret  philosophy  of  the  R.C.  is  founded  upon  that <br/>knowledge  which  is  the  sum  and  head  of  all  faculties,  sciences,  and  arts.  By  our  divinely  revealed <br/>system&#x2014; which  partakes  much  of  theology  and  medicine  but  little  of  jurisprudence&#x2014; we  analyze  the <br/>heavens  and  the  earth;  but  mostly  we  study  man  himself,  within  whose  nature  is  concealed  the <br/><br/><br/>supreme  secret.  If  the  learned  of  out  day  will  accept  our  invitation  and  join  themselves  to  our <br/>Fraternity,  we  will  reveal  to  them  undreamed-of  secrets  and  wonders  concerning  the  hidden  workings <br/>of  Nature. <br/><br/>Chapter  HI.  Do  not  believe  that  the  secrets  discussed  in  this  brief  document  are  lightly  esteemed  by <br/>us.  We  cannot  describe  fully  the  marvels  of  our  Fraternity  lest  the  uninformed  be  overwhelmed  by  our <br/>astonishing  declarations  and  the  vulgar  ridicule  the  mysteries  which  they  do  not  comprehend.  We <br/>also  fear  that  many  will  be  confused  by  the  unexpected  generosity  of  our  proclamation,  for  not <br/>understanding  the  wonders  of  this  sixth  age  they  do  nor  realize  the  great  changes  which  are  to  come. <br/>Like  blind  men  living  in  a  world  full  of  light,  they  discern  only  through  the  sense  of  feeling.  [By  sight <br/>is  implied  spiritual  cognition:  hy  feeling,  the  material  senses.] <br/><br/>Chapter  IV.  We  firmly  believe  that  through  deep  meditation  on  the  inventions  of  the  human  mind <br/>and  the  mysteries  of  life,  through  the  cooperation  of  the  angels  and  spirits,  and  through  experience <br/>and  long  observation,  our  loving  Christian  Father  C.R.C.  was  so  fully  illumined  with  God's  wisdom <br/>that  were  all  the  books  and  writings  of  the  world  lost  and  the  foundations  of  science  overturned,  the <br/>Fraternity  of  R.C.  could  reestablish  the  structure  of  world  thought  upon  the  foundation  of  divine  truth <br/>and  integrity.  Because  of  the  great  depth  and  perfection  of  our  knowledge,  those  desiring  to <br/>understand  the  mysteries  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.  C.  cannot  attain  to  that  wisdom  immediately,  but <br/>must  grow  in  understanding  and  knowledge.  Therefore,  our  Fraternity  is  divided  into  grades  through <br/>which  each  must  ascend  step  by  step  to  the  Great  Arcanum.  Now  that  it  has  pleased  God  to  lighten <br/>unto  us  His  sixth  candelabrum,  is  it  not  better  to  seek  truth  in  this  way  than  to  wander  through  the <br/>labyrinths  of  worldly  ignorance? <br/><br/>Furthermore,  those  who  receive  this  knowledge  shall  become  masters  of  all  arts  and  crafts;  no  secret <br/>shall  be  hidden  from  them;  and  all  good  works  of  the  past,  present,  and  future  shall  be  accessible  to <br/>them.  The  whole  world  shall  become  as  one  book  and  the  contradictions  of  science  and  theology  shall <br/>be  reconciled.  Rejoice,  O  humanity!  for  the  time  has  come  when  God  has  decreed  that  the  number  of <br/>our  Fraternity  shall  be  increased,  a  labor  that  we  have  joyously  undertaken.  The  doors  of  wisdom  are <br/>now  open  to  the  world,  but  only  to  those  who  have  earned  the  privilege  may  the  Brothers  present <br/>themselves,  for  it  is  forbidden  to  reveal  our  knowledge  even  to  our  own  children.  The  right  to  receive <br/>spiritual  truth  cannot  be  inherited:  it  must  be  evolved  within  the  soul  of  man  himself. <br/><br/>Chapter  V.  Though  we  may  be  accused  of  indiscretion  in  offering  our  treasures  so  freely  and <br/>promiscuously&#x2014; without  discriminating  between  the  godly,  the  wise,  the  prince,  the  peasant~we <br/>affirm  that  we  have  not  betrayed  our  trust;  for  although  we  have  published  our  Fama  in  five <br/>languages,  only  those  understand  it  who  have  that  right.  Our  Society  is  not  to  be  discovered  by <br/>curiosity <br/><br/><br/>JOHANN  VALENTIN  ANDRE/B. <br/><br/><br/>From  a  rare  print. <br/><br/>In  certain  esoteric  circles  there  are  vague  rumors  which  intimate  that  the  humble  personality  of  Johann  Valentin  Andreae <br/>masked  an  exalted  emissary  of  the  Rose  Cross.  While  there  is  sufficient  evidence  at  hand  to  establish  the  actual  existence <br/>of  a  German  theologian  by  the  name  of  Andreae,  there  are  many  discrepancies  in  his  biography  which  have  net  been <br/>cleared  up  to  the  satisfaction  of  critical  investigators.  A  comparison  of  the  face  shown  above  with  that  of  Sir  Francis  Bacon <br/>discloses  striking  resemblances  in  spite  of  the  differences  due  to  age.  If  Lord  Bacon  borrowed  the  name  and  identity  of <br/>William  Shakspere,  he  could  also  assume,  after  his  mock  funeral  in  England,  the  personality  of  Johann  Valentin  Andreae. <br/>The  crescent  below  the  bust  is  significant,  as  it  also  appears  upon  the  crest  of  Lord  Bacon;  to  denote  that  he  was  the <br/>second  son  of  Sir  Nicholas  Bacon.  Further,  the  four  letters  (0  MDC)  in  the  frame  at  the  lower  right  corner  of  the  plate,  by <br/>a  very  simple  Baconian  cipher,  can  be  changed  into  number  whose  sum  gives  33~the  numerical  equivalent  of  the  name <br/>Bacon.  These  several  points  of  interest,  when  considered  together,  go  far  towards  clearing  up  the  mystery  surrounding  the <br/>authorship  of  the  first  Rosicrucian  manifestoes. <br/><br/>p.  142 <br/><br/>seekers,  but  only  by  serious  and  consecrated  thinkers;  nevertheless  we  have  circulated  our  Fama  in <br/>five  mother  tongues  so  that  the  righteous  of  all  nations  may  have  an  opportunity  to  know  of  us,  even <br/>though  they  be  not  scholars.  A  thousand  times  the  unworthy  may  present  themselves  and  clamor  at <br/>the  gates,  but  God  has  forbidden  us  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  to  hear  their  voices,  and  He  has <br/>surrounded  us  with  His  clouds  and  His  protection  so  that  no  harm  may  come  to  us,  and  God  has <br/>decreed  that  we  of  the  Order  of  R.C.  can  no  longer  be  seen  by  mortal  eyes  unless  they  have  received <br/>strength  borrowed  from  the  eagle.  We  further  affirm  that  we  shall  reform  the  governments  of  Europe <br/>and  pattern  them  according  to  the  system  applied  by  the  philosophers  of  Damcar.  All  men  desirous  of <br/>securing  knowledge  shall  receive  as  much  as  they  are  capable  of  understanding.  The  rule  of  false <br/>theology  shall  be  overthrown  and  God  shall  make  His  will  known  through  His  chosen  philosophers. <br/><br/>Chapter  VII.  Because  of  the  need  of  brevity,  it  is  enough  to  say  that  our  Father  C.R.C.  was  born  in  the <br/>year  1378  and  departed  at  the  age  of  106,  leaving  to  us  the  labor  of  spreading  die  doctrine  of <br/>philosophic  religion  to  the  entire  world.  Our  Fraternity  is  open  to  all  who  sincerely  seek  for  truth;  but <br/>we  publicly  warn  the  false  and  impious  that  they  cannot  betray  or  injure  us,  for  God  has  protected  our <br/>Fraternity,  and  all  who  seek  to  do  it  harm  shall  have  their  evil  designs  return  and  destroy  them,  while <br/><br/><br/>the  treasures  of  our  Fraternity  shall  remain  untouched,  to  be  used  by  the  Lion  in  the  establishment  of <br/>his  kingdom. <br/><br/>Chapter  VII.  We  declare  that  God,  before  the  end  of  the  world,  shall  create  a  great  flood  of  spiritual <br/>light  to  alleviate  the  sufferings  of  humankind.  Falsehood  and  darkness  which  have  crept  into  the  arts, <br/>sciences,  religions,  and  governments  of  humanity&#x2014;making  it  difficult  for  even  the  wise  to  discover  the <br/>path  of  reality&#x2014;shall  be  forever  removed  and  a  single  standard  established,  so  that  all  may  enjoy  the <br/>fruitage  of  truth.  We  shall  not  be  recognized  as  those  responsible  for  this  change,  for  people  shall  say <br/>that  it  is  the  result  of  the  progressiveness  of  the  age.  Great  are  the  reforms  about  to  take  place;  but  we <br/>of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  do  not  arrogate  to  ourselves  the  glory  for  this  divine  reformation,  since  many <br/>there  are,  not  members  of  our  Fraternity  but  honest,  true  and  wise  men,  who  by  their  intelligence  and <br/>their  writings  shall  hasten  its  coming.  We  testify  that  sooner  the  stones  shall  rise  up  and  offer  their <br/>services  than  that  there  shall  be  any  lack  of  righteous  persons  to  execute  the  will  of  God  upon  earth. <br/><br/>Chapter  VIII.  That  no  one  may  doubt,  we  declare  that  God  has  sent  messengers  and  signs  in  the <br/>heavens,  namely,  the  i  new  stars  in  Serpentarius  and  Cygnus,  to  show  that  a  great  Council  of  the <br/>Elect  is  to  take  place.  This  proves  that  God  reveals  in  visible  nature&#x2014; for  the  discerning  few&#x2014; signs  and <br/>symbols  of  all  things  that  are  coming  to  pass.  God  has  given  man  two  eyes,  two  nostrils,  and  two  ears, <br/>but  only  one  tongue.  Whereas  the  eyes,  the  nostrils,  and  the  ears  admit  the  wisdom  of  Nature  into  the <br/>mind,  the  tongue  alone  may  give  it  forth.  In  various  ages  there  have  been  illumined  ones  who  have <br/>seen,  smelt,  tasted,  or  heard  the  will  of  God,  but  it  will  shortly  come  to  pass  that  those  who  have  seen, <br/>smelt,  tasted,  or  heard  shall  speak,  and  truth  shall  be  revealed.  Before  this  revelation  of  righteousness <br/>is  possible,  however,  the  world  must  sleep  away  the  intoxication  of  her  poisoned  chalice  (filled  with <br/>the  false  life  of  the  theological  vine)  and,  opening  her  heart  to  virtue  and  understanding,  welcome  the <br/>rising  sun  of  Truth. <br/><br/>Chapter  IX.  We  have  a  magic  writing,  copied  from  that  divine  alphabet  with  which  God  writes  His <br/>will  upon  the  face  of  celestial  and  terrestrial  Nature.  With  this  new  language  we  read  God's  will  for  all <br/>His  creatures,  and  just  as  astronomers  predict  eclipses  so  we  prognosticate  the  obscurations  of  the <br/>church  and  how  long  they  shall  last.  Our  language  is  like  unto  that  of  Adam  and  Enoch  before  the  Fall, <br/>and  though  we  understand  and  can  explain  our  mysteries  in  this  our  sacred  language,  we  cannot  do <br/>so  in  Latin,  a  tongue  contaminated  by  the  confusion  of  Babylon. <br/><br/>Chapter  X.  Although  there  are  still  certain  powerful  persons  who  oppose  and  hinder  us&#x2014; because  of <br/>which  we  must  remain  concealed&#x2014; we  exhort  those  who  would  become  of  our  Fraternity  to  study <br/>unceasingly  the  Sacred  Scriptures,  for  such  as  do  this  cannot  be  far  from  us.  We  do  not  mean  that  the <br/>Bible  should  be  continually  in  the  mouth  of  man,  but  that  he  should  search  for  its  true  and  eternal <br/>meaning,  which  is  seldom  discovered  by  theologians,  scientists,  or  mathematicians  because  they  are <br/>blinded  by  the  opinions  of  their  sects.  We  bear  witness  that  never  since  the  beginning  of  the  world  has <br/>there  been  given  to  man  a  more  excellent  book  than  the  Holy  Bible.  Blessed  is  he  who  possesses  it, <br/>more  blessed  he  who  reads  it,  most  blessed  he  who  understands  it,  and  most  godlike  he  who  obeys  it. <br/><br/>Chapter  XI.  We  wish  the  statements  we  made  in  the  Fama  Fraternitatis  concerning  the <br/>transmutation  of  metals  and  the  universal  medicine  to  be  lightly  understood.  While  we  realize  that <br/>both  these  works  are  attainable  by  man,  we  fear  that  many  really  great  minds  may  be  led  away  from <br/>the  true  quest  of  knowledge  and  understanding  if  they  permit  themselves  to  limit  their  investigation <br/>to  the  transmutation  of  metals.  When  to  a  man  is  given  power  to  heal  disease,  to  overcome  poverty, <br/>and  to  reach  a  position  of  worldly  dignity,  that  man  is  beset  by  numerous  temptations  and  unless  he <br/>possess  true  knowledge  and  full  understanding  he  will  become  a  terrible  menace  to  mankind.  The <br/>alchemist  who  attains  to  the  art  of  transmuting  base  metals  can  do  all  manner  of  evil  unless  his <br/>understanding  be  as  great  as  his  self-created  wealth.  We  therefore  affirm  that  man  must  first  gain <br/>knowledge,  virtue,  and  understanding;  then  all  other  things  maybe  added  unto  him.  We  accuse  the <br/><br/><br/>Christian  Church  of  the  great  sin  of  possessing  power  and  using  it  unwisely;  therefore  we  prophesy <br/>that  it  shall  fall  by  the  weight  of  its  own  iniquities  and  its  crown  shall  be  brought  to  naught. <br/><br/><br/>Chapter  XII.  In  concluding  our  Confessio,  we  earnestly  admonish  you  to  cast  aside  the  worthless <br/>books  of  pseudo-alchemists  and  philosophers  (of  whom  there  are  many  in  our  age),  who  make  light  of <br/>the  Holy  Trinity  and  deceive  the  credulous  with  meaningless  enigmas.  One  of  the  greatest  of  these  is  a <br/>stage  player,  a  man  with <br/><br/><br/>A  SYMBOLIC  DIAGRAM  OF  THE  OPERATIONS  OF  NATURE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  Collectio  Operum. <br/><br/>This  plate,  engraved  by  de  Bry,  is  the  most  famous  of  the  diagrams  illustrating  the  philosophic  principles  of  Robert  Fludd <br/>(Robertus  de  Fluctibus).  Three  figures  are  outstanding  links  between  Rosicrucianism  and  Freemasonry:  Michael  Maier, <br/>Elias  Ashmole,  and  Robert  Fludd.  De  Quincey  considers  Robert  Fludd  to  be  the  immediate  father  of  Freemasonry.  (See <br/>The  Rosicrucians  and  Freemasons.)  Edward  Waite  considers  Robert  Fludd  as  second  to  none  of  the  disciples  of <br/>Paracelsus,  even  going  as  far  as  to  declare  that  Fludd  far  surpassed  his  master.  He  further  adds,  &quot;The  central  figure  of <br/>Rosicrucian  literature,  towering  as  an  intellectual  giant  above  the  crowd  of  souffleurs,  theosophists,  and  charlatanic <br/>Professors  of  the  magnum  opus,  who,  directly  or  otherwise,  were  connected  with  the  mysterious  Brotherhood,  is  Robertus <br/><br/><br/>de  Fluctibus,  the  great  English  mystical  philosopher  of  the  seventeenth  century,  a  man  of  immense  erudition,  of  exalted <br/>mind,  and,  to  judge  by  his  writings,  of  extreme  personal  sanctity. &quot;  (See  The  Real  History  of  the  Rosicrucians.)  Robert <br/>Fludd  was  born  in  1574  and  died  in  1637. <br/><br/>The  de  Bry  diagram  shown  above  is  almost  self-explanatory.  Outside  the  circle  of  the  starry  heavens  are  the  three  fiery <br/>rings  of  the  empyreum~the  triple  fire  of  the  Supreme  Creator&#x2014;in  which  dwell  the  celestial  creatures.  Within  he,  of  the <br/>stars  are  the  circles  of  the  planets  and  elements.  After  the  element  of  air  comes  the  circle  of  the  world  (earth).  The  circle  of <br/>animals  is  followed  by  the  circle  of  plants,  which,  in  turn  is  followed  by  the  circle  of  he  minerals.  Then  come  various <br/>industries  and  in  the  center  is  a  terrestrial  globe  with  an  ape-man  sitting  upon  it,  measuring  a  sphere  with  a  pair  of <br/>compasses.  This  little  figure  represents  the  animal  creation.  In  the  outer  ring  of  fire,  above  is  the  sacred  name  of  Jehovah <br/>surrounded  by  clouds.  From  these  clouds  issues  a  hand  holding  a  chain.  Between  the  divine  sphere  and  the  lower  world <br/>personified  by  the  ape  is  the  figure  of  a  woman.  It  is  to  be  specially  noted  that  the  female  figure  is  merely  holding  the <br/>chain  connecting  her  with  the  lower  world,  but  the  chain  connecting  her  with  the  higher  world  ends  in  a  shackle  about  her <br/>wrist.  This  female  figure  is  capable  of  several  interpretations:  she  may  represent  humanity  suspended  between  divinity <br/>and  the  beast;  she  may  represent  Nature  as  the  link  between  God  and  the  lower  world;  or  she  may  represent  the  human <br/>soul&#x2014;the  common  denominator  between  the  superior  and  the  inferior. <br/><br/>P143 <br/><br/>sufficient  ingenuity  for  imposition.  Such  men  are  mingled  by  the  Enemy  of  human  welfare  among <br/>those  who  seek  to  do  good,  thus  making  Truth  more  difficult  of  discovery.  Believe  us,  Truth  is  simple <br/>and  unconcealed,  while  falsehood  is  complex,  deeply  hidden,  proud,  and  its  fictitious  worldly <br/>knowledge,  seemingly  a  glitter  with  godly  luster,  is  often  mistaken  for  divine  wisdom.  You  that  are <br/>wise  will  turn  from  these  false  teachings  and  come  to  us,  who  seek  not  your  money  but  freely  offer  you <br/>our  greater  treasure.  We  desire  not  your  goods,  but  that  you  should  become  partakers  of  our  goods. <br/>We  do  not  deride  parables,  but  invite  you  to  understand  all  parables  and  all  secrets.  We  do  not  ask <br/>you  to  receive  us,  but  invite  you  to  come  unto  our  kingly  houses  and  palaces,  not  because  of  ourselves <br/>but  because  we  are  so  ordered  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  the  desire  of  our  most  excellent  Father  C.R.C.,  and <br/>the  need  of  the  present  moment,  which  is  very  great. <br/><br/>Chapter  XIII.  Now  that  we  have  made  our  position  clear  that  we  sincerely  confess  Christ;  disavow  the <br/>Papacy;  devote  our  lives  to  true  philosophy  and  worthy  living;  and  daily  invite  and  admit  into  our <br/>Fraternity  the  worthy  of  all  nations,  who  thereafter  share  with  us  the  Light  of  God:  will  you  not  join <br/>yourselves  with  us  to  the  perfection  of  yourselves,  the  development  of  all  the  arts,  and  the  service  of <br/>the  world?  If  you  will  take  this  step,  the  treasures  of  every  part  of  the  earth  shall  be  at  one  time  given <br/>unto  you,  and  the  darkness  which  envelopes  human  knowledge  and  which  results  in  the  vanities  of <br/>material  arts  and  sciences  shall  be  forever  dispelled. <br/><br/>Chapter  XIV.  Again  we  warn  those  who  are  dazzled  by  the  glitter  of  gold  or  those  who,  now  upright, <br/>might  be  turned  by  great  riches  to  a  life  of  idleness  and  pomp,  not  to  disturb  our  sacred  silence  with <br/>their  clamorings;  for  though  there  be  a  medicine  which  will  cure  all  diseases  and  give  unto  all  men <br/>wisdom,  yet  it  is  against  the  will  of  God  that  men  should  attain  to  understanding  by  any  means  other <br/>than  virtue,  labor,  and  integrity.  We  are  not  permitted  to  manifest  ourselves  to  any  man  except  it  be <br/>by  the  will  of  God.  Those  who  believe  that  they  can  partake  of  our  spiritual  wealth  against  the  will  of <br/>God  or  without  His  sanction  will  find  that  they  shall  sooner  lose  their  lives  in  seeking  us  than  attain <br/>happiness  by  finding  us. <br/><br/>FRATERNITAS  R.C. <br/><br/>Johann  Valentin  Andreas  is  generally  reputed  to  be  the  author  of  the  Confessio.  It  is  a  much-mooted <br/>question,  however,  whether  Andrese  did  not  permit  his  name  to  be  used  as  a  pseudonym  by  Sir <br/>Francis  Bacon.  Apropos  of  this  subject  are  two  extremely  significant  references  occurring  in  the <br/>introduction  to  that  remarkable  potpourri.  The  Anatomy  of  Melancholy.  This  volume  first  appeared <br/>in  1621  from  the  pen  of  Democritus  junior,  who  was  afterwards  identified  as  Robert  Burton,  who,  in <br/>turn,  was  a  suspected  intimate  of  Sir  Francis  Bacon.  One  reference  archly  suggests  that  at  the  time  of <br/>publishing  The  Anatomy  of  Melancholy  in  1621  the  founder  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  was  still  alive. <br/><br/><br/>This  statement &#x2014;concealed  from  general  recognition  by  its  textual  involvement&#x2014;has  escaped  the <br/>notice  of  most  students  of  Rosicrucianism.  In  the  same  work  there  also  appears  a  short  footnote  of <br/>stupendous  import.  It  contains  merely  the  words:  &quot;Job.  Valent.  Andreas,  Lord  Verulam.&quot;  This  single <br/>line  definitely  relates  Johann  Valentin  Andreee  to  Sir  Francis  Bacon,  who  was  Lord  Verulam,  and  by <br/>its  punctuation  intimates  that  they  are  one  and  the  same  individual. <br/><br/>Prominent  among  Rosicrucian  apologists  was  John  Heydon,  who  inscribes  himself  &quot;A  Servant  of  God, <br/>and  a  Secretary  of  Nature.&quot;  In  his  curious  work.  The  Rosie  Cross  Uncovered,  he  gives  an  enigmatic <br/>but  valuable  description  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  in  the  following  language: <br/><br/>&quot;Now  there  are  a  kind  of  men,  as  they  themselves  report,  named  Rosie  Crucians,  a  divine  fraternity <br/>that  inhabit  the  suburbs  of  heaven,  and  these  are  the  officers  of  the  Generalissimo  of  the  world,  that <br/>are  as  the  eyes  and  ears  of  the  great  King,  seeing  and  hearing  all  things:  they  say  these  Rosie  Crucians <br/>are  seraphically  illuminated,  as  Moses  was,  according  to  this  order  of  the  elements,  earth  refin'd  to <br/>water,  water  to  air,  air  to  fire.&quot;  He  further  declares  that  these  mysterious  Brethren  possessed <br/>polymorphous  powers,  appearing  in  any  desired  form  at  will.  In  the  preface  of  the  same  work,  he <br/>enumerates  the  strange  powers  of  the  Rosicrucian  adepts: <br/><br/>&quot;I  shall  here  tell  you  what  Rosie  Crucians  are,  and  that  Moses  was  their  Father,  and  he  was  Qeov  naiq; <br/>some  say  they  were  of  the  order  of  Elias,  some  say  the  Disciples  of  Ezekiel;  *  *  *  For  it  should  seem <br/>Rosie  Crucians  were  not  only  initiated  into  the  Mosaical  Theory,  but  have  arrived  also  to  the  power  of <br/>working  miracles,  as  Moses,  Elias,  Ezekiel,  and  the  succeeding  Prophets  did,  as  being  transported <br/>where  they  please,  as  Habakkuk  was  from  Jewry  to  Babylon,  or  as  Philip,  after  he  had  baptized  the <br/>Eunuch  to  Azorus,  and  one  of  these  went  from  me  to  a  friend  of  mine  in  Devonshire,  and  came  and <br/>brought  me  an  answer  to  London  the  some  day,  which  is  four  days  journey;  they  caught  me  excellent <br/>predictions  of  Astrology  and  Earthquakes;  they  slack  the  Plague  in  Cities;  they  silence  the  violent <br/>Winds  and  Tempests;  they  calm  the  rage  of  the  Sea  and  Rivers;  they  walk  in  the  Air,  they  frustrate  the <br/>malicious  aspects  of  Witches;  they  cure  all  Diseases.&quot; <br/><br/>The  writings  of  John  Heydon  are  considered  a  most  important  contribution  to  Rosicrucian  literature. <br/>John  Heydon  was  probably  related  to  Sir  Christopher  Heydon,  &quot;a  Seraphically  Illuminated  Rosie <br/>Crucian, &quot;  whom  the  late  F.  Leigh  Gardner,  Hon.  Secretary  Sec.  Ros.  in  Anglia,  believes  to  have  been <br/>the  source  of  his  Rosicrucian  knowledge.  In  his  Bibliotheca  Rosicruciana  he  makes  the  following <br/>statement  concerning  John  Heydon:  &quot;On  the  whole,  from  the  internal  evidence  of  his  writings,  he <br/>appears  to  have  gone  through  the  lower  grade  of  the  R.  C.  Order  and  to  have  given  out  much  of  this  to <br/>the  world.&quot;  John  Heydon  traveled  extensively,  visiting  Arabia,  Egypt,  Persia,  and  various  parts  of <br/>Europe,  as  related  in  a  biographical  introduction  to  his  work.  The  Wise-Mans  Crown,  Set  with  Angels, <br/>Planets,  Metals,  etc.,  or  The  Glory  of  the  Rosie  Cross&#x2014; a  work  declared  by  him  to  be  a  translation  into <br/>English  of  the  mysterious  book  M  brought  from  Arabia  by  Christian  Rosencreutz. <br/><br/>Thomas  Vaughan  (Eugenius  Philalethes),  another  champion  of  the  Order,  corroborates  the  statement <br/>of  John  Heydon  concerning  the  ability  of  the  Rosicrucian  initiates  to  make  themselves  invisible  at  will: <br/>&quot;The  Fraternity  of  R.C.  can  move  in  this  white  mist.  'Whosoever  would  communicate  with  us  must  be <br/>able  to  see  in  this  light,  or  us  he  will  never  see  unless  by  our  own  will.'&quot; <br/><br/>The  Fraternity  of  R.C.  is  an  august  and  sovereign  body,  arbitrarily  manipulating  the  symbols  of <br/>alchemy,  Qabbalism,  astrology,  and  magic  to  the  attainment  of  its  own  peculiar  purposes,  but  entirely <br/>independent  of  the  cults  whose  terminology  it  employs.  The  three  major  objects  of  the  Fraternity  are: <br/><br/>1.  The  abolition  of  all  monarchical  forms  of  government  and  the  substitution  therefor  of  the <br/>ruler  ship  of  the  philosophic  elect.  The  present  democracies  are  the  direct  outgrowth  of  Rosicrucian <br/>efforts  to  liberate  the  maws  from  the  domination  of  despotism.  In  the  early  part  of  the  eighteenth <br/>century  the  Rosicrucians  turned  their  attention  to  the  new  American  Colonies,  then  forming  the <br/><br/><br/>nucleus  of  a  great  nation  in  the  New  World.  The  American  War  of  Independence  represents  their  first <br/>great  political  experiment  and  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  a  national  government  founded  upon <br/>the  fundamental  principles  of  divine  and  natural  law.  As  an  imperishable  reminder  of  their <br/><br/><br/>THE  ALCHEMICAL  ANDROGYNE <br/><br/><br/>From  the  Turhse  Philosophorum. <br/><br/>The  Turbae  Philosophorum  is  one  of  the  earliest  known  documents  on  alchemy  in  the  Latin  tongue.  Its  exact  origin  is <br/>unknown.  It  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  The  Third  Pythagorical  Synod.  As  its  name  implies,  it  is  an  assembly  of  the  sages <br/>and  sets  forth  the  alchemical  viewpoints  of  many  of  the  early  Greek  philosophers.  The  symbol  reproduced  above  is  from  a <br/>rare  edition  of  the  Turbse  Philosophorum  published  in  Germany  in  1750,  and  represents  by  a  hermaphroditic  figure  the <br/>accomplishment  of  the  magnum  opus.  The  active  and  passive  principles  of  Nature  were  often  depicted  by  male  and <br/>female  figures,  and  when  these  two  principle,  were  harmoniously  conjoined  in  any  one  nature  or  body  it  was  customary  to <br/>symbolize  this  state  of  perfect  equilibrium  by  the  composite  figure  above  shown. <br/><br/><br/>A  ROSICRUCIAN  TITLE  PAGE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Maier's  Viatorium. <br/><br/>Count  Michael  Maier,  physician  to  Rudolph  II.,  was  an  outstanding  figure  in  the  Rosicrucian  controversy.  There  is  little <br/>doubt  that  he  was  an  initiated  member  of  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity,  empowered  by  the  Order  to  promulgate  its  secrets <br/>among  the  philosophic  elect  of  Europe.  The  above  title  page  shows  the  seven  planets  represented  by  appropriate  figures. <br/>Behind  the  central  figure  in  each  case  is  a  smaller  emblem,  signifying  the  zodiacal  sign  in  which  the  planet  is  enthroned. <br/>In  the  arch  over  the  title  itself  is  a  portrait  of  the  learned  Maier.  The  volume  of  which  this  is  the  title  page  is  devoted  to  an <br/>analysis  of  the  nature  and  effect  of  the  seven  planets,  and  is  couched  in  alchemical  terminology  throughout.  Michael  Maier <br/>concealed  his  knowledge  so  cunningly  that  it  is  exceedingly  difficult  to  tract  from  his  writings  the  secrets  which  he <br/>possessed.  He  was  profuse  in  his  use  of  emblems  and  the  greater  part  of  his  philosophical  lore  is  concealed  in  the <br/>engravings  which  illustrate  his  books. <br/><br/>p.  144 <br/><br/>sub  rosa  activities,  the  Rosicnicians  left  the  Great  Seal  of  the  United  States.  The  Rosicrucians  were <br/>also  the  instigators  of  the  French  Revolution,  but  in  this  instance  were  not  wholly  successful,  owing  to <br/>the  fact  that  the  fanaticism  of  the  revolutionists  could  not  be  controlled  and  the  Reign  of  Terror <br/>ensued. <br/><br/>2.  The  reformation  of  science,  philosophy,  and  ethics.  The  Rosicrucians  declared  that  the  material <br/>arts  and  sciences  were  but  shadows  of  the  divine  wisdom,  and  that  only  by  penetrating  the  innermost <br/>recesses  of  Nature  could  man  attain  to  reality  and  understanding.  Though  calling  themselves <br/>Christians,  the  Rosicrucians  were  evidently  Platonists  and  also  profoundly  versed  in  the  deepest <br/>mysteries  of  early  Hebrew  and  Hindu  theology.  There  is  undeniable  evidence  that  the  Rosicrucians <br/>desired  to  reestablish  the  institutions  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  as  the  foremost  method  of  instructing <br/>humanity  in  the  secret  and  eternal  doctrine.  Indeed,  being  in  all  probability  the  perpetuators  of  the <br/>ancient  Mysteries,  the  Rosicrucians  were  able  to  maintain  themselves  against  the  obliterating  forces <br/>of  dogmatic  Christianity  only  by  absolute  secrecy  and  the  subtlety  of  their  subterfuges.  They  so <br/>carefully  guarded  and  preserved  the  Supreme  Mystery&#x2014;the  identity  and  interrelationship  of  the  Three <br/>Selves&#x2014; that  no  one  to  whom  they  did  not  of  their  own  accord  reveal  themselves  has  ever  secured  any <br/>satisfactory  information  regarding  either  the  existence  or  the  purpose  of  the  Order.  The  Fraternity  of <br/><br/><br/>R.C.,  through  its  outer  organization,  is  gradually  creating  an  environment  or  body  in  which  the <br/>Illustrious  Brother  C.R.C.  may  ultimately  incarnate  and  consummate  for  humanity  the  vast  spiritual <br/>and  material  labors  of  the  Fraternity. <br/><br/>3.  The  discovery  of  the  Universal  Medicine,  or  panacea,  for  all  forms  of  disease.  There  is  ample <br/>evidence  that  the  Rosicrucians  were  successful  in  their  quest  for  the  Elixir  of  Life.  In  his  Theatrum <br/>Chemicum  Britannicum,  Elias  Ashmole  states  that  the  Rosicrucians  were  not  appreciated  in  England, <br/>but  were  welcomed  on  the  Continent.  He  also  states  that  Queen  Elizabeth  was  twice  cured  of  the <br/>smallpox  by  the  Brethren  of  the  Rosy  Cross,  and  that  the  Earl  of  Norfolk  was  healed  of  leprosy  by  a <br/>Rosicrucian  physician.  In  the  quotations  that  follow  it  is  .hinted  by  John  Heydon  that  the  Brothers  of <br/>the  Fraternity  possessed  the  secret  of  prolonging  human  existence  indefinitely,  but  not  beyond  the <br/>time  appointed  by  the  will  of  God: <br/><br/>&quot;And  at  last  they  could  restore  by  the  same  course  every  Brother  that  died  to  life  again,  and  so <br/>continue  many  ages;  the  rules  you  find  in  the  fourth  book.  *  *  *  After  this  manner  began  the <br/>Fraternity  of  the  Rosie  Cross,  first  by  four  persons,  who  died  and  rose  again  until  Christ,  and  then <br/>they  came  to  worship  as  the  Star  guided  them  to  Bethlehem  of  Judea,  where  lay  our  Saviour  in  his <br/>mother's  arms;  and  then  they  opened  their  treasure  and  presented  unto  him  gifts,  gold,  frankincense, <br/>and  myrrh,  and  by  the  commandment  of  God  went  home  to  their  habitation.  These  four  waxing <br/>young  again  successively  many  hundreds  of  years,  made  a  magical  language  and  writing,  with  a  large <br/>dictionary,  which  we  yet  daily  use  to  God's  praise  and  glory,  and  do  find  great  wisdom  therein.  *  *  * <br/>Now  whilst  Brother  C.R.  was  in  a  proper  womb  quickening,  they  concluded  to  draw  and  receive  yet <br/>others  more  into  their  Fraternity.&quot; <br/><br/>The  womb  herein  referred  to  was  apparently  the  glass  casket,  or  container,  in  which  the  Brothers <br/>were  buried.  This  was  also  called  the  philosophical  egg.  After  a  certain  period  of  time  the  philosopher, <br/>breaking  the  shell  of  his  egg,  came  forth  and  functioned  for  a  prescribed  period,  after  which  he  retired <br/>again  into  his  shell  of  glass,  The  Rosicrucian  medicine  for  the  healing  of  all  human  infirmities  may  be <br/>interpreted  either  as  a  chemical  substance  which  produces  the  physical  effects  described  or  as <br/>spiritual  understanding&#x2014;the  true  healing  power  which,  whet  a  man  has  partaken  of  it,  reveals  truth  to <br/>him.  Ignorance  is  the  worst  form  of  disease,  and  that:  which  heals  ignorance  is  therefore  the  most <br/>potent  of  all  medicines.  The  perfect  Rosicrucian  medicine  was  for  the  healing  of  nations,  races,  and <br/>individuals. <br/><br/>In  an  early  unpublished  manuscript,  an  unknown  philosopher  declares  alchemy,  Qabbalism, <br/>astrology,  and  magic  to  have  been  divine  sciences  originally,  but  that  through  perversion  they  had <br/>become  false  doctrines,  leading  seekers  after  wisdom  ever  farther  from  their  goal.  The  same  author <br/>gives  a  valuable  key  to  esoteric  Rosicrucianism  by  dividing  the  path  of  spiritual  attainment  into  three <br/>steps,  or  schools,  which  he  calls  mountains.  The  first  and  lowest  of  these  mountains  is  Mount  Sophia; <br/>the  second,  Mount  Qabbalah;  and  the  third,  Mount Magia.  These  three  mountains  are  sequential <br/>stages  of  spiritual  growth.  The  unknown  author  then  states: <br/><br/>&quot;By  philosophy  is  to  be  understood  the  knowledge  of  the  workings  of  Nature,  by  which  knowledge <br/>man  learns  to  climb  to  those  higher  mountains  above  the  limitations  of  sense.  By  Qabbalism  is  to  be <br/>understood  the  language  of  the  angelic  or  celestial  beings,  and  he  who  masters  it  is  able  to  converse <br/>with  the  messengers  of  God.  On  the  highest  of  the  mountains  is  the  School  of  Magia  (Divine  Magic, <br/>which  is  the  language  of  God)  wherein  man  is  taught  the  true  nature  of  all  things  by  God  Himself.&quot; <br/><br/>There  is  a  growing  conviction  that  if  the  true  nature  of  Rosicrucianism  were  divulged,  it  would  cause <br/>consternation,  to  say  the  least.  Rosicrucian  symbols  have  many  meanings,  but  the  Rosicrucian <br/>meaning  has  not  yet  been  revealed.  The  mount  upon  which  stands  the  House  of  the  Rosy  Cross  is  still <br/>concealed  by  clouds,  in  which  the  Brethren  hide  both  themselves  and  their  secrets.  Michael  Maier <br/>writes:  &quot;What  is  contained  in  the  Fama  and  Confessio  is  true.  It  is  a  very  childish  objection  that  the <br/><br/><br/>brotherhood  have  promised  so  much  and  performed  so  Httle.  With  them,  as  elsewhere,  many  are <br/>called  but  few  are  chosen.  The  masters  of  the  order  hold  out  the  rose  as  the  remote  prize,  but  they <br/>impose  the  cross  on  those  who  are  entering.&quot;  (See  Silentium  post  Clamores,  by  Maier,  and  The <br/>Rosicrucians  and  the  Freemasons,  by  De  Quincey.) <br/><br/>The  rose  and  the  cross  appear  upon  the  stained  glass  windows  of  Lichfield  Chapter  House,  where <br/>Walter  Conrad  Arensberg  believes  Lord  Bacon  and  his  mother  to  have  been  buried.  A  crucified  rose <br/>within  a  heart  is  watermarked  into  the  dedication  page  of  the  1628  edition  of  Robert  Burton's <br/>Anatomy  of  Melancholy. <br/><br/>The  fundamental  symbols  of  the  Rosicrucians  were  the  rose  and  the  cross;  the  rose  female  and  the <br/>cross  male,  both  universal  phallic  emblems.  While  such  learned  gentlemen  as  Thomas  Inman, <br/>Hargrave  Jennings,  and  Richard  Payne  Knight  have  truly  observed  that  the  rose  and  the  cross  typify <br/>the  generative  processes,  these  scholars  seem  unable  to  pierce  the  veil  of  symbolism;  they  do  not <br/>realize  that  the  creative  mystery  in  the  material  world  is  merely  a  shadow  of  the  divine  creative <br/>mystery  in  the  spiritual  world.  Because  of  the  phallic  significance  of  their  symbols,  both  the <br/>Rosicrucians  and  the  Templars  have  been  falsely  accused  of  practicing  obscene  rites  in  their  secret <br/>ceremonials.  While  it  is  quite  true  that  the  alchemical  retort  symbolizes  the  womb,  it  also  has  a  far <br/>more  significant  meaning  concealed  under  the  allegory  of  the  second  birth.  As  generation  is  the  key  to <br/>material  existence,  it  is  natural  that  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  should  adopt  as  its  characteristic  symbols <br/>those  exemplifying  the  reproductive  processes.  As  regeneration  is  the  key  to  spiritual  existence,  they <br/>therefore  founded  their  symbolism  upon  the  rose  and  the  cross,  which  typify  the  redemption  of  man <br/>through  the  union  of  his  lower  temporal  nature  with  his  higher  eternal  nature.  The  rosy  cross  is  also  a <br/>hieroglyphic  figure  representing  the  formula  of  the  Universal  Medicine. <br/><br/><br/>THE  ELEMENTARY  WORLD. <br/><br/><br/>From  Musaeum  Hermeticum  Reformatum  et  Amplificatum. <br/><br/>The  outer  circle  contains  the  figures  of  the  Zodiac;  the  second,  their  signs  and  that  part  of  the  human  body  which  they  rule; <br/>the  third,  the  months  of  the  year,  with  brief  notes  concerning  temperaments,  etc.  The  fourth  circle  contains  the  elements <br/>accompanied  by  their  appropriate  symbols,  and  the  following  seven  circles  mark  the  orbits  of  the  planets;  also  the <br/>planetary  angels,  the  seven  major  members  of  the  Universal  Man,  and  the  seven  metals,  each  division  appearing  under  its <br/>appropriate  element  according  to  the  elemental  names  in  the  fourth  circle.  In  the  twelfth  circle  appear  the  words:  &quot;There <br/>are  Three  Principles,  Three  Worlds,  Three  Ages,  and  Three  Kingdoms.&quot;  In  the  thirteenth  circle  appear  the  names  of  the <br/>twelve  arts  and  sciences  which  are  considered  essential  to  spiritual  growth.  In  the  fourteenth  circle  is  the  word  Nature. <br/>The  fifteenth  circle  contains  the  following  words.  &quot;It  is  the  great  honour  of  faithful  souls,  that  from  their  very  birth  an <br/>angel  is  appointed  to  preserve  and  keep  each  of  them.&quot;  (See  first  English  translation,  London,  1893.) <br/><br/><br/>p-145 <br/><br/><br/>Fifteen  Rosicrucian  and  Qabbalistic <br/><br/>Diagrams <br/><br/>IN  his  well-known  work,  The  Rosicrucians,  Their  Rites  and  Mysteries,  Hargrave  Jennings  reproduces <br/>five  Qabbalistic  charts  which  he  declares  to  be  genuine  Rosicrucian  drawings.  He  gives  no <br/>information  concerning  their  origin  nor  does  he  attempt  an  elucidation  of  their  symbolism.  A  recent <br/>writer  who  reproduced  one  of  these  charts  correlated  it  to  the  emblematic  tomb  of  Father  C.R.C.,  thus <br/>exposing  the  true  nature  of  Christian  Rosencreutz. <br/><br/>The  five  plates  reproduced  in  Hargrave  Jennings'  book  are  part  of  a  series  of  fifteen  diagrams  which <br/>appear  in  The  Magical,  Qabbalistical,  and  Theosophical  Writings  ofGeorgius  von  Welling,  on  the <br/>Subject  of  Salt,  Sulphur,  and  Mercury.  This  extremely  rare  volume  was  published  at  Frankfort  and <br/>Leipzig  in  1735  and  1760.  The  numbers  and  figures  on  the  charts  refer  to  the  chapters  and  sections  of <br/>the  Writings.  These  fifteen  charts  constitute  a  remarkable  and  invaluable  addition  to  the  few  other <br/>known  admittedly  authentic  Qabbalistic  and  Rosicrucian  diagrams. <br/><br/>Lucifer  is  the  greatest  mystery  of  symbolism.  The  secret  knowledge  of  the  Rosicrucians  concerning <br/>Lucifer  is  nowhere  so  plainly  set  forth  as  in  these  plates,  which  virtually  reveal  his  true  identity,  a <br/>carefully  guarded  secret  about  which  little  has  been  written.  Lucifer  is  represented  by  the  number  741. <br/><br/>Von  Welling  does  not  give  a  complete  exposition  of  the  fifteen  charts;  to  have  done  so  would  have <br/>been  contrary  to  the  principles  of  Qabbalistic  philosophy.  The  deeper  significance  of  the  symbols  is <br/>revealed  only  by  profound  study  and  contemplation. <br/><br/>TABLET,  Figures  1-11.  Figure  1  is  a  Ptolemaic  chart  showing  the  true  relationship  existing  between <br/>the  primordial  elements.  Its  secret  significance  is  as  follows:  The  outer  ring  enclosed  by  the  lines  A <br/>and  B  is  the  region  of  Schamayim,  a  Qabbalistic  name  for  the  Supreme  Deity,  signifying  the  expanse <br/>of  the  heavens,  or  a  spiritual  fiery  water.  Schamayim  is  &quot;The  Ocean  of  Spirit, &quot;  within  which  all <br/>created  and  uncreated  things  exist  and  by  the  life  of  which  they  are  animated.  In  the  lower  worlds <br/>Schamayim  becomes  the  astral  light. <br/><br/>The  space  between  B  and  C  marks  the  orbits  or  planes  of  the  seven  Spiritual  Intelligences  called  the <br/>Divine  Planets  (not  the  visible  planets).  According  to  the  Mysteries,  the  souls  of  men  enter  the  lower <br/>worlds  through  ring  B,  the  fixed  stars.  All  creation  reflects  the  glory  of  Schamayim,  the  energy  that <br/>filters  into  the  spheres  of  the  elements  through  the  windows  of  the  stars  and  planets.  Between  C  and <br/>D  lies  the  region  of  the  subtle,  spiritual  air,  a  subdivision  of  ether.  DXoE  marks  the  surface  of  the <br/>earth  and  sea,  by  which  are  also  meant  grades  of  ether.  E  to  F  marks  the  lower  region,  called  &quot;The <br/>Gathering  of  the  Waters  and  the  Production  of  the  Virgin  Earth, &quot;  or  &quot;Ares. &quot;  The  alchemists  called <br/>this  &quot;quicksand,&quot;  the  true  mystic  foundation  of  the  solid  earth.  Fto  G  marks  the  circle  of  the <br/>subterranean  air,  which  is  more  dense  and  coarse  than  that  in  the  outer  space,  C  to  D.  In  this  denser <br/>atmosphere  the  stellar  influences  and  celestial  impulses  are  crystallized  into  corporeal  spirits,  thus <br/>forming  the  multitude  of  forms  which  exist  without  knowledge  of  their  own  fiery  source.  G  is  the <br/>region  of  the  central  fire  of  the  element  earth,  a  coarse  fire  in  contradistinction  to  the  divine  fiery <br/>Schamayim.  The  sphere  of  the  starry  heavens  likewise  has  its  opposite  in  the  sphere  of  the <br/>subterranean  air;  and  the  sphere  of  the  upper  air  (or  subtle  vaporous  water)  has  its  opposite  in  the <br/>sphere  E  to  F.  The  focal  point,  D  to  E,  between  the  three  higher  and  the  three  lower  spheres,  is  called <br/>&quot;The  Reservoir.&quot;  It  receives  impressions  from  both  the  superior  and  the  inferior  regions  and  is <br/>common  to  both. <br/><br/><br/>Figure  2  is  the  Qabbalistic  symbol  of  elemental  water;  Figure  9  represents  the  spiritual  invisible  water. <br/><br/>Figure  3  is  the  Qabbalistic  symbol  of  elemental  air;  Figure  7  represents  the  spiritual  and  invisible  air. <br/>Figure  4  is  the  Qabbalistic  sign  of  the  elemental  earth;  Figure  8  represents  the  spiritual  and  invisible <br/>earth.  Figure  5  is  the  Qabbalistic  sign  of  the  elemental  fire;  Figure  6  represents  the  spiritual  and <br/>invisible  fire.  Figures  6,  7,  8,  and  9  symbolize  the  four  elements  before  the  descent  of  Lucifer.  They <br/>are  the  four  rivers  spoken  of  in  Genesis,  having  their  source  in  the  one  river,  Figure  W,  which <br/>represents  the  elements  superimposed  on  one  another.  The  golden  ball  in  the  center  is  Schamayim, <br/>the  fiery  source  of  all  elements.  Figure  11  is  the  emblem  of  the  beginning  and  the  end  of  all  creatures. <br/>From  it  all  things  proceed  and  to  it  all  must  return  again,  to  become  one  with  the  fiery  water  of  divine <br/>understanding. <br/><br/>TABLE  II,  Figures  12-51.  Figures  12, 13, 14  demonstrate  the  sphere  as  a  symbol  of  motion  to  be <br/>emblematic  of  fire,  water,  and  air;  and  the  cube  as  a  symbol  of  weight  to  be  emblematic  of  earth.  The <br/>sphere  rests  upon  a  point,  the  cube  upon  a  surface;  the  sphere  is  therefore  used  to  symbolize  spirit, <br/>and  the  cube,  matter.  Figure  14  demonstrates  that  atmosphere  rushing  in  behind  a  falling  object <br/>increases  its  velocity  and  apparently  adds  to  its  weight.  The  essential  nature  of  each  element  is <br/>occultly  signified  by  the  peculiar  symbol  and  character  assigned  to  it. <br/><br/>Of  Figure  15,  the  symbol  of  salt,  von  Welling  writes,  in  substance:  The  cube  has  six  sides, <br/>corresponding  to  the  six  days  of  creation,  with  the  point  of  rest  (the  seventh  day)  in  the  center  of  the <br/>cube.  On  each  surface  of  the  cube  appear  the  signs  of  the  four  elements  [triangles].  The  alchemists <br/>declared  that  salt  was  the  first  created  substance  produced  by  the  fire  (Schamayim)  which  flowed  out <br/>of  God.  In  salt  all  creation  is  concentrated;  in  salt  are  the  beginning  and  end  of  all  things.  The  cube, <br/>furthermore,  is  composed  of  twelve  bodies,  each  of  which  has  six  sides.  These  bodies  are  the  twelve <br/>fundamental  pillars  of  the  true  invisible  church,  and  when  these  twelve  bodies  are  multiplied  by  their <br/>six  sides  the  magical  number  72  results.  The  wise  have  said  that  nothing  is  perfect  until  it  has  been <br/>dissolved,  separated,  and  again  united  so  that  it  becomes  a  body  composed  of  twelve  bodies,  like  the <br/>cube.  The  cube  also  consists  of  six  pyramids  with  the  six  surfaces  of  the  cube  as  their  bases.  The <br/>points  of  these  six  pyramids  meet  at  the  center  of  the  cube.  These  six  pyramids,  each  consisting  of <br/>four  triangles,  signify  the  elements,  and  produce  the  magical  number  24,  which  refers  to  the  Elders <br/>before  the  Throne.  The  six  surfaces  and  the  point  constitute  the  magical  number  7.  If  7  be  multiplied <br/>by  7  again,  and  so  on  7  times,  the  answer  will  reveal  the  method  used  by  the  ancients  for  measuring <br/>the  periods  of  eternity;  thus:  (1)  7  X  7  =  49;  (2)  49  X  7  =  343;  (3)  343  X  7  =  2,401;  (4)  2,401  X  7  = <br/>16,807;  (5):i6,8o7  X  7  =  117,649;  (6)  117,649  X  7  =  823,543;  (7)  823,543  X  7  =  5,764,801.  (This  is  not <br/>to  be  taken  as  earth  years  or  times.)  The  5,000,  000  represents  the  great  hall  year;  the  700,000  the <br/>great  Sabbath  year,  wherein  all  human  beings  gradually  gain  true  understanding  and  become  heirs  to <br/>their  original  and  eternal  inheritance,  which  was  lost  when  they  were  enmeshed  in  the  lower  elements. <br/>The  64,800  is  the  number  of  the  fallen  angels,  and  the  last  one  year  signifies  the  liberation  of  Lucifer <br/>and  return  to  his  original  estate. <br/><br/>Figure  16  is  another  symbol  of  salt,  while  Figure  17  (the  dot)  is  the  sign  of  spirit,  gold,  the  sun,  or  the <br/>germ  of  life.  If  the  dot  be  moved  before  itself  it  becomes  a  line.  Figure  18.  This  motion  of  the  dot  is  the <br/>first  motion.  The  beginning  and  end  of  every  line  is  a  dot.  Figure  19  is  the  circle.  It  is  the  second <br/>motion  and  the  most  perfect  of  all  lines.  Out  of  it  are  formed  all  figures  and  bodies <br/><br/><br/>TABLE  II,  Figures  12-51. <br/><br/><br/>p.  146 <br/><br/><br/>imaginable.  Figure  20  represents  the  outpouring  of  the  upper  and  spiritual  life  into  manifestation. <br/>Figure  21  represents  darkness,  for  it  is  the  loosening  of  the  subterrene  destructive  principle.  Figure  20 <br/>is  also  the  symbol  of  day,  and  Figure  21  of  night. <br/><br/>Figure  22  is  a  symbol  of  water;  Figure  23  is  the  complete  universal  character  of  light  and  darkness. <br/>The  upright  triangle  represents  Schamayim;  the  inverted  triangle  the  dark  earth  which  imprisons  the <br/>infernal  subterranean  fire.  It  is  &quot;The  First  Day  of  Creation,&quot;  or  the  time  of  the  separation  of <br/>Schamayim  and  Ares.  Figure  24  represents  the  six  days  of  creation  and  proves  that  the  elements  are <br/>an  outflow  of  the  Divine  Fire  which,  breaking  up,  becomes  the  substances  of  the  tangible  universe,  as <br/>signified  in  Figure  25. <br/><br/>Figure  26  is  the  character  of  the  air,  showing  that  air  is  born  out  of  the  Eternal  Light  and  the  ethereal <br/>water.  Figure  27  is  the  character  of  water.  It  is  the  inversion  of  Figure  26,  indicating  that  its  origin  is <br/>from  the  lower  fire  and  not  the  higher.  Its  upper  part  signifies  that  water  does  not  lack  the  Divine <br/>element,  but  as  a  universal  mirror  reflects  the  heavenly  influences.  Figures  28  and  29  are  symbols  of <br/>salt,  showing  that  it  is  both  fire  and  water  in  one.  Figure  30  is  the  character  of  fire  in  all  its  attributes, <br/>and  Figure  M  (the  same  inverted),  water  in  all  its  powers.  Figure  32  is  the  character  of  salt  in  all  its <br/>attributes.  Figure  33  represents  both  gold  and  the  sun.  Their  essential  natures  are  identical,  being <br/>formed  from  the  first  fire  out  of  Schamayim.  They  are  perfect,  as  can  be  seen  from  their  symbol,  for <br/>no  more  perfect  form  can  be  produced  out  of  the  dot  than  the  circle. <br/><br/>Figure  34  is  the  character  of  the  greater  and  lesser  worlds;  as  the  dot  is  surrounded  by  its <br/>circumference,  this  world  is  surrounded  by  Schamayim.  Man  (the  Little  World)  is  included  in  this <br/>symbol  because  his  inner  nature  is  potential  gold  (Aphar  Min  Haadamah),  which  gold  is  his  eternal <br/>indestructible  spiritual  body.  Gold  is  the  masculine  principle  of  the  universe. <br/><br/>Figure  35  is  the  character  of  silver  and  the  moon.  It  signifies  that  silver  (like  gold)  is  a  perfect  metal, <br/>except  that  the  red  part  of  its  nature  is  turned  inward.  Silver  is  the  feminine  principle  of  the  universe. <br/><br/>Figure  36  is  the  character  of  copper  and  Venus;  Figure  37,  of  iron  and  Mars;  Figure  38,  of  tin  and <br/>Jupiter;  Figure  39,  of  lead  and  Saturn;  Figure  40,  of  Mercury  (both  the  planet  and  the  element); <br/>Figure  41,  of  antimony,  the  key  metal  of  the  earth  itself;  Figure  42,  of  arsenic;  Figure  43,  of  sulphur; <br/>Figure  44,  of  cinnabar;  Figure  45,  of  quicklime;  Figure  46,  of  nitre;  and  Figure  47,  of  vitriol.  Figure  48 <br/>is  the  character  of  sal  ammoniac,  which  element  derives  its  name  from  the  Temple  of  Jupiter  Ammon <br/>in  an  Egyptian  desert,  where  it  was  found.  Figure  49  is  the  character  of  alum;  Figure  50,  of  alkali,  a <br/>name  of  Arabian  origin;  and  Figure  51,  of  sal  tartar,  a  substance  possessing  great  occult  virtue. <br/><br/>TABLE  III,  Figure  52.  The  eight  globes  and  the  central  square  represent  the  seven  days  of  creation. <br/>The  three  worlds  wherein  creation  occurs  are  symbolized  by  three  concentric  rings.  The  German <br/>words  in  the  outer  ring  are  extracts  from  the  first  chapter  of  Genesis.  The  words  around  the  outside  of <br/>the  outer  ring  are  The  First  Day.  The  four  small  globes  inside  the  outer  ring  deal  with  the  abstract <br/>phases  of  creation.  The  upper  globe  containing  the  triangle  encloses  the  words  Heaven  and  Earth. <br/>The  globe  to  the  right  contains  the  word  Light,  and  the  one  to  the  left,  Jehovah  Elohim  in  the  upper <br/>part  and  Darkness  in  the  lower  part.  The  globe  at  the  bottom  contains  the  word  Day  in  the  upper  half <br/>and  Night  in  the  lower. <br/><br/>The  four  globes  within  the  second  ring  depict  the  second,  third,  fourth,  and  fifth  days  of  creation.  The <br/>white  globe  above  divided  by  a  dotted  line  is  designated  The  Second  Day;  the  globe  to  the  left  with  the <br/>mountains.  The  Third  Day;  the  globe  to  the  right  with  the  planetary  rings.  The  Fourth  Day;  and  the <br/>globe  below  bisected  by  a  dotted  line.  The  Fifth  Day.  The  square  in  the  central  ring  containing  the <br/><br/><br/>human  form  is  marked  The  Sixth  Day.  This  chart  is  a  diagrammatic  exposition  of  the  three  layers  of <br/>the  macrocosmic  and  microcosmic  auric  eggs,  showing  the  forces  active  within  them. <br/><br/>TABLE  IV,  Figure.  53.  Figure  53  has  been  designated  the  symbolic  tomb  of  Christian  Rosencreutz. <br/>The  upper  circle  is  the  first  world&#x2014;the  Divine  Sphere  of  God.  The  triangle  in  the  center  is  the  throne <br/>of  God.  The  small  circles  at  the  points  of  the  star  symbolize  the  seven  great  Spirits  before  the  throne, <br/>mentioned  in  the  Book  of  Revelation,  in  the  midst  of  which  walks  the  Alpha  and  Omega&#x2014;the  Son  of <br/>God.  The  central  triangle  contains  three  flames&#x2014; the  Divine  Trinity.  From  the  lowest  of  these  flames <br/>proceeds  the  first  divine  outflow,  shown  by  two  parallel  lines  descending  through  the  throne  of  Saturn <br/>(the  Spirit  Orifelis,  through  whom  God  manifested  Himself).  Passing  through  the  boundary  of  the <br/>celestial  universe  and  the  22  spheres  of  the  lower  system,  the  lines  end  at  point  B,  the  throne  of <br/>Lucifer,  in  whom  the  divine  outpouring  is  concentrated  and  reflected.  From  him  the  divine  light <br/>irradiates  in  succession  to  d  (Capricorn),  e  (Gemini),/(Libra),  g  (Taurus),  h  (Pisces),  i  (Aquarius),  k <br/>(Cancer),  /  (Virgo),  m  (Aries),  n  (Leo),  o  (Scorpio),  p  (Sagittarius),  thence  back  to  d.  The  zodiacal <br/>circles  represent  twelve  orders  of  great  and  beneficent  Spirits,  and  the  smaller  circles  within  the  ring <br/>of  fixed  stars  mark  the  orbits  of  the  sacred  planets. <br/><br/>TABLE  V,  Figure  54.  Figure  54  is  similar  to  Figure  53,  but  represents  the  universe  at  the  time  God <br/>manifested  Himself  through  the  character  of  Jupiter,  the  Spirit  Sachasiel.  Von  Welling  gives  no <br/>reason  for  the  change  in  the  order  of  influx  into  the  twelve  orders  of  spirits,  for  the  third  world,  for <br/>the  adding  of  another  circle  and  the  interlaced  triangles  in  the  upper  world,  or  for  the  letters  Y  and  Z. <br/>In  the  upper  triangle. <br/><br/><br/>Table  III,  Figure  52 <br/><br/><br/>Table  V,  Figure  54 <br/><br/><br/>Table  VII,  Figures  1-5, 7  and  8 <br/><br/><br/>p.  147 <br/><br/>A  represents  the  Father  Principle,  Fthe  divine  outflow,  G  the  point  of  influx  into  the  twelve  orders  of <br/>spirits  (probably  Sagittarius).  The  letters  H,  I,  J,  K,  L,  M,  N,  O,  P,  Q,  S,  and  T  denote  the  sequential <br/>points  of  irradiations  to  each  other;  W^and  X,  the  World  of  the  Sons  of  God;  and  B,  C,  D,  and  E,  the <br/>World  of  Lucifer.  This  plate  shows  the  universe  after  the  descent  of  Lucifer  into  matter.  According  to <br/>von  Welling,  when  Lucifer  wanted  to  control  power,  the  influx  of  the  divine  light  instantly  ceased. <br/>Lucifer's  world  (which  later  became  the  solar  system),  with  all  its  legions  of  spirits  (who  in  their <br/>essence  were  Schamayim)  reflecting  his  ideas  and  inverting  the  divine  light,  was  turned  into  darkness. <br/>Lucifer's  Schamayim  thereupon  became  a  contracted  disc,  a  tangible  substance;  and  Chaos  came  into <br/>existence. <br/><br/>TABLE  VI,  Figures  55-59.  Figure  55  symbolizes  the  Chaos  of  Lucifer;  Figure  56,  the  separation  of <br/>light  from  darkness;  Figure  57,  the  light  in  the  midst  of  the  darkness;  and  Figure  58,  the  regions  of  the <br/>elements  and  their  inhabitants.  The  four  A's  signify  the  Abyss  surrounding  all  things.  TheAB  is  the <br/>fiery  throne  of  Lucifer.  The  plane  of  g  is  the  subterranean  air;/,  the  subterranean  water;  c,  the  earth <br/>region;  d,  the  outer  water;  e,  the  outer  air,     and  X  the  region  of  Schamayim.  The  elemental <br/>inhabitants  of  the  planes  differ  in  goodness  according  to  their  proximity  to  the  center  of  wickedness <br/>(A  B).  The  earth's  surface  (c)  divides  the  subterranean  elementals  from  those  of  the  outer  water,  air, <br/>and  fire  (d,  c,  andX).  The  elementals  of  the  upper  strata  (the  upper  half  of  c,  and  all  of  d,  e,  andX) <br/>represent  an  ascending  scale  of  virtue,  while  those  of  the  lower  strata  (the  lower  half  of  c,  and  all  off, <br/>g,  and  A  B)  represent  a  descending  scale  of  depravity. <br/><br/><br/>The  region  of  air  (e)  is  a  partial  exception  to  this  order.  While  air  is  close  to  the  light  and  filled  with <br/><br/>beautiful  spirits,  it  is  also  the  habitation  of  Beelzebub,  the  Evil  Spirit  of  the  air,  with  his  legion  of <br/>elemental  demons.  Upon  the  subtle  element  of  air  are  impressed  the  influences  of  the  stars;  the <br/>thoughts,  words,  and  deeds  of  man;  and  a  myriad  of  mysterious  influences  from  the  various  planes  of <br/>Nature.  Man  inhales  these  impressions,  and  they  produce  diverse  effects  upon  his  mind.  In  air  are <br/>suspended  also  the  seed  germs  by  which  water  is  impregnated  and  made  capable  of  bringing  forth <br/>forms  of  organic  and  inorganic  life.  The  grotesque  figures  seen  in  crystal  caves  and  frost  pictures <br/>upon  windows  are  caused  by  these  aerial  impressions.  While  the  air  elementals  are  great  and  wise, <br/>they  are  treacherous  and  confused  because  amenable  to  both  good  and  evil  impressions.  The  mighty <br/>elemental  beings  who  inhabit  the  watery  light  fire  of  the  region  X  cannot  be  deceived  by  the  spirits  of <br/>darkness.  They  love  the  creatures  of  the  waters,  for  the  watery  element  (d)  proceeded  from  the  fiery <br/>water  {X).  Mortal  man  cannot  endure  the  society  of  these  fiery  spirits,  but  gains  wisdom  from  them <br/>through  the  creatures  of  the  waters  in  which  they  continually  mirror  themselves.  Figure  59  represents <br/>this  solar  system,  with  W^andX  as  the  locality  of  the  Garden  of  Eden. <br/><br/>TABLE  VII,  Figures  1-5, 7,  8.  (Table  VIII  has  Figure  6.)  Figure  1  is  the  triune  divine  sulphur,  the  All- <br/>Perfect  out  of  the  All-Perfect,  the  Soul  of  creatures.  The  threefold  Divine  One  is  symbolized  by  three <br/>interlaced  circles  designated  alchemically  salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury.  In  the  central  triangle  is  the <br/>divine  name  Ehieh.  Geist  means  spirit.  The  other  words  require  no  translation.  Figure  2  is  common <br/>destructive  sulphur.  A  bar  placed  in  the  triangle  makes  it  the  character  of  earth.  Figure  3  is  true  oil  of <br/>vitriol,  composed  of  a  circle  with  two  diameters  and  two  reversed  half -circles  hanging  below.  In  this <br/>are  hidden  the  characters  of  all  metals.  Tin  is  symbolized  by  Figure  4  and  iron  by  Figure  5.  Figure  7  is <br/>the  solar  system  according  to  Copernicus.  Figure  8  is  the  last  judgment.  The  sun  is  removed  from  the <br/>center  of  the  solar  system  and  replaced  by  the  earth.  This  changes  the  respective  positions  of  all  the <br/>other  planets  except  Mars,  Jupiter,  and  Saturn,  which  retain  their  respective  circles.  The  letter  a <br/>signifies  the  circle  of  the  sun;  b,  that  of  Mercury;  c,  that  of  Venus;  d,  (sic)  that  of  the  moon;  and  E, <br/>that  of  the  earth.  Inward  from  the  sphere  h  are  the  great  circles  of  damnation. <br/><br/>TABLE  VII.,  Figure  6.  In  Figure  6  the  letter  a  marks  the  center  of  eternity.  The  motion  of  the  rays <br/>toward  b,  d,  and  c  was  the  first  divine  manifestation  and  is  symbolized  by  the  equilateral  triangle,  b,  d, <br/>c.  The  eternal  world  within  the  inner  circle  became  manifest  in  the  water  (salt),  the  light  (mercury), <br/>and  the  fire  (sulphur)  of  the  archetypal  world,  represented  by  the  three  circles  (f,  e,  g)  within  the <br/>triangle  of  complete  equality  (h,  i,  k),  which  is  in  turn  surrounded  by  the  circle  of  the  high  throne.  The <br/>circle/is  named  understanding;  e,  wisdom;  g,  reason.  In  circle  i  is  the  word  Father;  in  circle  h,  Son; <br/>in  circle  k.  Spirit.  The  seven  outer  circles  are  the  seven  spirits  before  the  throne.  The  lower  part  of  the <br/>figure  is  similar  to  Figures  53  and  54.  The  outer  circles  are  the  angelic  world  ending  in  the  cognizable <br/>world  of  the  Sons  of  God.  Then  comes  the  circle  of  the  visible  constellations  and  fixed  stars;  within <br/>this  is  the  solar  system  with  the  sun  as  the  center  (Z).  Ungrund  means  the  Abyss. <br/><br/>TABLE  IX,  Figure  9.  Figure  9  is  a  synthesis  of  the  Old  and  New  Testaments  and  represents  the <br/>interblending  planes  of  being.  In  the  right  margin  the  seven  outer  circles  contain  the  names  of  the <br/>planetary  angels.  The  words  in  the  graduated  circles  from  the  top  triangle  downward  read:  (1)  Abyss <br/>of  Compassion;  {2)Zion;  (3)  The  New  Heaven  and  the  New  Earth;  (4)  The  New  Jerusalem;  (5) <br/>Paradise;  (6)  The  Bosom  of  Abraham;  (7)  The  Outer  Courts  of  the  Lord.  From  below  the  circles  of <br/>darkness  reach  upward,  each  divine  principle  being  opposed  by  an  infernal  opposite.  The  small  circle <br/>on  the  left  containing  a  triangle  and  cross  is  named  The  Tree  of  Life,  and  that  on  the  right  The  Tree  of <br/>the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil.  In  the  center  of  the  diagram  is  the  Trinity,  joined  with  the  superior <br/>and  inferior  planes  by  lines  of  activity. <br/><br/>TABLE  X,  Figures  10-15.  Figure  10  shows  the  New  Jerusalem  in  form  of  a  cube,  with  the  names  of  the <br/>twelve  tribes  of  Israel  written  on  the  twelve  lines  of  the  cube.  In  the  center  is  the  eye  of  God.  The <br/>words  round  the  outer  circle  are  from  the  Book  of  Revelation.  Figures  11, 12, 13, 14,  and  15  possibly <br/><br/><br/>are  cipher  symbols  of  the  angels  of  the  plagues,  the  name  of  the  Antichrist,  the  signature  of  the  beast <br/>of  Babylon,  and  the  name  of  the  woman  riding  on  the  beast  of  blasphemy. <br/><br/><br/>Table  VIII,  Figure  6. <br/><br/><br/>p^-i0  d4  C  Vif <br/><br/><br/>MA <br/><br/><br/>rf&#x00ab;  It-  cyl  c  vs  iir. <br/><br/><br/>Table  X,  Figures  10-15. <br/><br/><br/>Table  IX,  Figure  9. <br/><br/><br/>Table  XI,  Figures  i-ii <br/><br/><br/>p.  148 <br/><br/>TABLE  XI,  Figures  i.-ii.  Figure  1  is  the  solar  system  according  to  Genesis.  The  o  on  top  of  the  radius <br/>of  the  circle  is  the  dot  of  Eternity&#x2014;the  Beginning  of  Beginnings.  The  whole  diameter  is  the  outflow  of <br/>God,  manifesting  first  in  the  heaven  of  heavens&#x2014;the  Schamayim,  in  which  region  human <br/>understanding  cannot  function.  The  space  from  k  to  i  contains  the  heavens  of  Saturn,  Jupiter,  and <br/>Mars;  I  to  m,  the  heavens  of  Venus  and  Mercury;  m  to  h,  the  heavens  of  the  sun.  The  letter  e  is  the <br/>moon,  the  circle  of  the  earth. <br/><br/>Figure  2  is  the  globe  of  the  earth,  showing  the  houses  and  signs  of  the  zodiac.  Figure  3  is  the  character <br/>of  the  Universal  Mercury  (Divine  Life)  in  its  triune  aspect  of  mercury,  sulphur,  and  salt.  Figure  4  is <br/>true  saltpetre  purified  with  quicklime  and  alkali.  Figure  5  shows  the  exact  degree  or  angle  of  the <br/>planets'  places  as  well  as  the  individual  fixed  stars  in  the  zodiac.  The  letter  a  is  the  sun  and  b  is  the <br/>earth.  From  k  to  i  are  the  circles  of  Mercury  and  Venus;  g  to  h,  the  circles  of  earth  and  moon;/to  e <br/>and  e  to  c,  of  Jupiter  and  Saturn;  c  to  d,  the  starry  belt  or  zodiac.  Figure  6  is  the  Microcosm,  with  the <br/>planets  and  signs  of  the  zodiac  corresponding  to  the  different  parts  of  its  form.  The  words  upon  the <br/>figure  read:  Know  thyself.  In  words,  herbs,  and  stones  lies  a  great  power.  Figure  7  is  the  universal <br/>character  from  which  all  characters  have  been  taken.  Figures  8,  9,  and  10  are  left  to  the  solution  of  the <br/>reader.  Figure  11  is  the  radiating  Universal  Mercury. <br/><br/>TABLE  Xn,  Figures  12-19.  Figure  12  is  called  A  Mirror  of  Astrological  Aspects.  Below  it  is  an <br/><br/>astrologer's  wheel.  Figure  13  is  similar  to  Figure  12.  Figure  14  is  a  secret  alchemical  formula.  The <br/>words  around  the  circle  read:  Out  of  one  in  all  is  all.  Figure  15  is  an  unsatisfactory  attempt  to  show <br/>the  comparative  sizes  of  the  suns  and  planets  and  their  distances  from  each  other.  Figure  16  is  the <br/><br/><br/>solar  system  with  its  internal  and  spiritual  heavens.  A  B  is  the  solar  system;  C  is  the  sphere  of  fixed <br/>stars;  D,  E,  F,  G  are  the  systems  of  the  spiritual  worlds;  H  is  the  throne  of  the  living  God;  J,  K,  L,  M, <br/>and  N  are  the  Great  Beyond,  unmeasurable. <br/><br/>Figure  17  shows  the  creation  of  the  solar  system  out  of  the  ring  of  the  Divine  Eternity.  The  four  A's  are <br/><br/>the  Abyss,  B  is  the  first  revelation  of  God  out  of  the  Abyss,  and  from  this  revelation  C,  D,  E,  F,  and  G <br/>were  created.  C  and  D  represent  the  spiritual  hierarchies;  D  and  E,  the  upper  worlds,  or  constellations; <br/>E  and  F,  the  distance  from  Jupiter  to  the  upper  worlds;  F  and  G,  the  solar  system  with  its  planets  and <br/>their  heavens;  B  and  C  the  throne  of  Christ. <br/><br/>Figure  18  describes  the  division  according  to  Genesis  of  the  waters  above  the  heavens  (&#x00a3;))  from  the <br/>waters  below  (A,  B,  and  C).  Figure  19  is  the  mercury  of  the  philosophers,  essential  to  material <br/>existence. <br/><br/>TABLE XIII,  Figures  1-4.  Figure  1  is  Ain  Soph,  the  Incomprehensible  Abyss  of  Divine  Majesty,  an <br/>endless  welling  up,  limitless  in  time  and  space.  Figure  2  symbolizes  the  three  Divine  Principles- <br/>Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Ghost.  Around  the  triangle  is  written:  I  Shall  Be  That  I  Shall  Be.  At  the  apex  of <br/>the  triangle  is  the  word  Crown;  in  the  left  point.  Wisdom;  in  the  right  point.  Understanding.  Figure  3 <br/>represents  the  Trinity  with  its  outflow.  The  words  above  the  upper  sphere  are  Revelation  of  the <br/>Divine  Majesty  in  Jehovah  Elohim.  The  lower  circles  contain  the  names  of  the  Hierarchies <br/>controlling  the  lower  worlds.  The  words  within  the  circle  of  stars  read:  Lucifer  the  Son  of  the  Aurora <br/>of  the  morning.  The  letter  C  represents  the  Universal  Mercury.  The  words  within  the  circle  read:  The <br/>first  beginning  of  all  creatures.  Figure  4  represents  the  abode  of  Lucifer  and  his  angels,  the  Chaos <br/>spoken  of  in  Genesis. <br/><br/>TABLE  XIV,  Figures  5,  7,  8.  Figure  5  shows  the  triangle  of  triune  Divinity  in  the  midst  of  a  cross.  At <br/><br/>the  left  is  a  small  triangle  containing  the  words  The  Secrets  of  Elohim,  and  at  the  right  is  another <br/>inscribed  The  Secrets  of  Nature.  On  the  horizontal  arms  of  the  cross  are  the  words  The  Tree  of  Life <br/>and  The  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil.  The  plate  explains  the  interblending  of  the  spiritual <br/>and  infernal  powers  in  the  creation  of  the  universe.  Figure  7  is  called  The  Road  to  Paradise.  It <br/>probably  indicates  the  positions  of  the  sun,  moon,  and  planets  at  the  moment  of  their  genesis.  Figure <br/>8  is  the  earth  before  the  flood,  when  it  was  watered  by  a  mist  or  vapor.  The  words  at  the  left  are  The <br/>Tree  of  Life;  those  at  the  right.  The  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  good  and  Evil.  The  diagram  with  the <br/>symbol  of  Mars  is  devoted  to  a  consideration  of  the  rainbow. <br/><br/>TABLE  XV,  Figures  6,  9, 10.  Figure  6  is  similar  to  Figure  5  and  is  called  The  Secret  of  Nature.  An <br/>interesting  diagram  is  shown  on  either  side  of  the  central  figure,  each  consisting  of  a  triangle  with <br/>circles  radiating  from  its  points.  The  diagram  on  the  left  is  called  The  Secrets  of  the  Upper  World,  and <br/>the  one  on  right  The  Secrets  of  the  Underworld. <br/><br/>Figure  9  is  the  solar  system.  Around  the  central  part  are  the  words  The  Place  of  the  Damned.  Figure <br/>10  shows  the  dot,  or  point  of  rest,  surrounded  by  a  triangle  enclosing  a  circle  containing  the  names  of <br/>the  twelve  tribes  of  Israel.  It  represents  completion  of  the  process  of  regeneration  and  the <br/>consummation  of  the  Great  Work. <br/><br/><br/>Table  XIII,  Figures  1-4 <br/><br/><br/>Table  XV,  Figures  6, 9,  and  10 <br/><br/><br/>p.  149 <br/><br/><br/>Alchemy  and  Its  Exponents <br/><br/>IS  the  transmutation  of  base  metals  into  gold  possible?  Is  the  idea  one  at  which  the  learned  of  the <br/>modern  world  can  afford  to  scoff?  Alchemy  was  more  than  a  speculative  art:  it  was  also  an  operative <br/>art.  Since  the  time  of  the  immortal  Hermes,  alchemists  have  asserted  (and  not  without  substantiating <br/>evidence)  that  they  could  manufacture  gold  from  tin,  silver,  lead,  and  mercury.  That  the  galaxy  of <br/>brilliant  philosophic  and  scientific  minds  who,  over  a  period  of  two  thousand  years,  affirmed  the <br/>actuality  of  metallic  transmutation  and  multiplication,  could  be  completely  sane  and  rational  on  all <br/>other  problems  of  philosophy  and  science,  yet  hopelessly  mistaken  on  this  one  point,  is  untenable. <br/>Nor  is  it  reasonable  that  the  hundreds  declaring  to  have  seen  and  performed  transmutations  of  metals <br/>could  all  have  been  dupes,  imbeciles,  or  liars. <br/><br/>Those  assuming  that  all  alchemists  were  of  unsound  mentality  would  be  forced  to  put  in  this  category <br/>nearly  all  the  philosophers  and  scientists  of  the  ancient  and  mediaeval  worlds.  Emperors,  princes, <br/>priests,  and  common  townsfolk  have  witnessed  the  apparent  miracle  of  metallic  metamorphosis.  In <br/>the  face  of  existing  testimony,  anyone  is  privileged  to  remain  unconvinced,  but  the  scoffer  elects  to <br/>ignore  evidence  worthy  of  respectful  consideration.  Many  great  alchemists  and  Hermetic <br/>philosophers  occupy  an  honored  niche  in  the  Hall  of  Fame,  while  their  multitudinous  critics  remain <br/>obscure.  To  list  all  these  sincere  seekers  after  Nature's  great  arcanum  is  impossible,  but  a  few  will <br/>suffice  to  acquaint  the  reader  with  the  superior  types  of  intellect  who  interested  themselves  in  this <br/>abstruse  subject. <br/><br/>Among  the  more  prominent  names  are  those  of  Thomas  Norton,  Isaac  of  Holland,  Basil  Valentine <br/><br/>(the  supposed  discoverer  of  antimony),  Jean  de  Meung,  Roger  Bacon,  Albertus  Magnus,  Quercetanus <br/>Gerber  (the  Arabian  who  brought  the  knowledge  of  alchemy  to  Europe  through  his  writings), <br/>Paracelsus,  Nicholas  Flarnmel,  John  Frederick  Helvetius,  Raymond  LuUy,  Alexander  Sethon,  Michael <br/>Sendivogius,  Count  Bernard  of  Treviso,  Sir  George  Ripley,  Picus  de  Mirandola,  John  Dee,  Henry <br/>Khunrath,  Michael  Maier,  Thomas  Vaughan,  J.  B.  von  Helmont,  John  Heydon,  Lascaris,  Thomas <br/>Charnock,  Synesius  (Bishop  of  Ptolemais),  Morieu,  the  Comte  di  Cagliostro,  and  the  Comte  de  St.- <br/>Germain.  There  are  legends  to  the  effect  that  King  Solomon  and  Pythagoras  were  alchemists  and  that <br/>the  former  manufactured  by  alchemical  means  the  gold  used  in  his  temple. <br/><br/>Albert  Pike  takes  sides  with  the  alchemical  philosophers  by  declaring  that  the  gold  of  the  Hermetists <br/>was  a  reality.  He  says:  &quot;The  Hermetic  science,  like  all  the  real  sciences,  is  mathematically <br/>demonstrable.  Its  results,  even  material,  are  as  rigorous  as  that  of  a  correct  equation.  The  Hermetic <br/>Gold  is  not  only  a  true  dogma,  a  light  without  Shadow,  a  Truth  without  alloy  of  falsehood;  it  is  also  a <br/>material  gold,  real,  pure,  the  most  precious  that  can  be  found  in  the  mines  of  the  earth.&quot;  So  much  for <br/>the  Masonic  angle. <br/><br/>William  and  Mary  jointly  ascended  the  throne  of  England  in  1689,  at  which  time  alchemists  must <br/>have  abounded  in  the  kingdom,  for  during  the  first  year  of  their  reign  they  repealed  an  Act  made  by <br/>King  Henry  IV  in  which  that  sovereign  declared  the  multiplying  of  metals  to  be  a  crime  against  the <br/>crown.  In  Dr.  Sigismund  Bacstrom's  Collection  of  Alchemical  Manuscripts  is  a  handwritten  copy  of <br/>the  Act  passed  by  William  and  Mary,  copied  from  Chapter  30  of  Statutes  at  Large  for  the  first  year  of <br/>their  reign.  The  Act  reads  as  follows:  &quot;An  Act  to  repeal  the  Statute  made  in  the  5th  year  of  King  Henry <br/>IV,  late  king  of  England,  [wherein]  it  was  enacted,  among  other  things,  in  these  words,  or  to  this  effect, <br/>namely:  'that  none  from  henceforth  should  use  to  multiply  Gold  or  Silver  or  use  the  craft  of <br/>multiplication,  and  if  any  the  same  do  they  shall  incur  the  pain  of  felony.'  And  whereas,  since  the <br/>making  of  the  said  statute,  divers  persons  have  by  their  study,  industry  and  learning,  arrived  to  great <br/>skill  &amp;  perfection  in  the  art  of  melting  and  refining  of  metals,  and  otherwise  improving  and <br/><br/><br/>multiplying  them  and  their  ores,  which  very  much  abound  in  this  realm,  and  extracting  gold  and <br/>silver  our  of  the  same,  but  dare  not  to  exercise  their  said  skill  within  this  realm,  for  fear  of  falling <br/>under  the  penalty  of  the  said  statute,  but  exercise  the  said  art  in  foreign  parts,  to  the  great  loss  and <br/>detriment  of  this  realm:  Be  it  therefore  enacted  by  the  King's  and  Queen's  most  excellent  Majesties, <br/>by  and  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Lords  spiritual  and  temporal  and  Commons  in  this  present <br/>parliament  assembled,  that  from  henceforth  the  aforesaid  branch,  article,  or  sentence,  contained  in <br/>the  said  act,  and  every  word,  matter  and  thing  contained  in  the  said  branch  or  sentence,  shall  be <br/>repealed,  annulled,  revoked,  and  for  ever  made  void,  any  thing  in  the  said  act  to  the  contrary  in  any <br/>wise  whatsoever  notwithstanding.  Provided  always,  and  be  it  enacted  by  the  authority  aforesaid,  that <br/>all  the  gold  and  silver  that  shall  be  extracted  by  the  aforesaid  art  of  melting  or  refining  of  metals,  and <br/>otherwise  improving  and  multiplying  of  them  and  their  ores,  as  before  set  forth,  be  from  henceforth <br/>employed  for  no  other  use  or  uses  whatsoever  but  for  the  increase  of  monies;  and  that  the  place <br/>hereby  appointed  for  the  disposal  thereof  shall  be  their  Majesties  mint,  within  the  Tower  of  London, <br/>at  which  place  they  are  to  receive  the  full  and  true  value  of  their  gold  and  silver,  so  procured,  from <br/>time  to  time,  according  to  the  assay  and  fineness  thereof,  and  so  for  any  greater  or  less  weight,  and <br/>that  none  of  that  metal  of  gold  and  silver  so  refined  and  procured  be  permitted  to  be  used  or  disposed <br/>of  in  any  other  place  or  places  within  their  Majesties  dominions.&quot;  After  this  repealing  measure  had <br/>become  effective,  William  and  Mary  encouraged  the  further  study  of  alchemy. <br/><br/>Dr.  Franz  Hartmann  has  collected  reliable  evidence  concerning  four  different:  alchemists  who <br/>transmuted  base  metals  into  gold  not  once  but  many  times.  One  of  these  accounts  concerns  a  monk  of <br/>the  Order  of  St.  Augustine  named  Wenzel  Seller,  who  discovered  a  small  amount  of  mysterious  red <br/>powder  in  his  convent.  In  the  presence  of  Emperor  Leopold  I,  King  of  Germany,  Hungary,  and <br/>Bohemia,  he  transmuted  quantities  of  tin  into  gold.  Among  other  things  which  he  dipped  into  his <br/>mysterious  essence  was  a  large  silver  medal.  That  part  of  the  medal  which  came  in  contact  with  the <br/>gold-producing  substance  was  transmuted  into  the  purest  quality  of  the  more  precious  metal.  The <br/>rest  remained  silver.  With  regard  to  this  medal,  Dr.  Hartmann  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;The  most  indisputable  proof  (if  appearances  can  prove  anything)  of  the  possibility  of  transmuting <br/>base  metals  into  gold,  may  be  seen  by  everyone  who  visits  Vienna;  it  being  a  medal  preserved  in  the <br/>Imperial  treasury  chamber,  and  it  is  stated  that  this  medal,  consisting  originally  of  silver,  has  been <br/>partly  transformed  into  gold,  by  alchemical  means,  by  the  same  Wenzel  Seller  who  was  afterwards <br/>made  a  knight  by  the  Emperor  Leopold  I.  and  given  the  title  Wenzeslaus  Ritter  von  Reinburg.  &quot;(/n  the <br/>Pronaos  of  the  Temple  of  Wisdom.) <br/><br/>Space  limitations  preclude  a  lengthy  discussion  of  the  alchemists.  A  brief  sketch  of  the  lives  of  four <br/>should  serve  to  show  the  general  principles  on  which  they  worked,  the  method  by  which  they <br/>obtained  their  knowledge,  and  the  use  which  they  made  of  it.

This  man,  who  called  himself  Paracelsus,  declared  that  some  day  all  the <br/>doctors  of  Europe  would  turn  from  the  other  schools  and,  following  him,  revere  him  above  every <br/>other  physician.  The  accepted  date  of  the  birth  of  Paracelsus  is  December  17, 1493.  He  was  an  only <br/>child.  Both  his  father  and  mother  were  interested  in  medicine  and  chemistry.  His  father  was  a <br/><br/><br/>physician  and  his  mother  the  superintendent  of  a  hospital.  While  still  a  youth,  Paracelsus  became <br/>greatly  interested  in  the  writings  of  Isaac  of  Holland,  and  determined  to  reform  the  medical  science  of <br/>his  day. <br/><br/>When  twenty  years  old  he  began  a  series  of  travels  which  continued  for  about  twelve  years.  He  visited <br/>many  European  countries,  including  Russia.  It  is  possible  that  he  penetrated  into  Asia.  It  was  in <br/>Constantinople  that  the  great  secret  of  the  Hermetic  arts  was  bestowed  upon  him  by  Arabian  adepts. <br/>His  knowledge  of  the  Nature  spirits  and  the  inhabitants  of  the  invisible  worlds  he  probably  secured <br/>from  the  Brahmins  of  India  with  whom  he  came  in  contact  either  directly  or  through  their  disciples. <br/>He  became  an  army  physician,  and  his  understanding  and  skill  brought  him  great  success. <br/><br/>Upon  his  return  to  Germany,  he  began  his  long-dreamed-of  reformation  of  the  medical  arts  and <br/>sciences.  He  was  opposed  on  every  hand  and  criticized  unmercifully.  His  violent  temper  and <br/>tremendously  strong  personality  undoubtedly  precipitated  many  storms  upon  his  head  which  might <br/>have  been  avoided  had  he  been  of  a  less  caustic  disposition.  He  flayed  the  apothecaries,  asserting  that <br/>they  did  not  use  the  proper  ingredients  in  their  prescriptions  and  did  not  consider  the  needs  of  their <br/>patients,  desiring  only  to  collect  exorbitant  fees  for  their  concoctions. <br/><br/>The  remarkable  cures  which  Paracelsus  effected  only  made  his  enemies  hate  him  more  bitterly,  for <br/>they  could  not  duplicate  the  apparent  miracles  which  he  wrought.  He  not  only  treated  the  more <br/>common  diseases  of  his  day  but  is  said  to  have  actually  cured  leprosy,  cholera,  and  cancer.  His  friends <br/>claimed  for  him  that  he  all  but  raised  the  dead.  His  systems  of  healing  were  so  heterodox,  however, <br/>that  slowly  but  surely  his  enemies  overwhelmed  him  and  again  and  again  forced  him  to  leave  the <br/>fields  of  his  labors  and  seek  refuge  where  he  was  not  known. <br/><br/>There  is  much  controversy  concerning  the  personality  of  Paracelsus.  That  he  had  an  irascible <br/>disposition  there  is  no  doubt.  His  barred  for  physicians  and  for  women  amounted  to  a  mania;  for <br/>them  he  had  nothing  but  abuse.  As  far  as  can  be  learned,  there  was  never  a  love  affair  in  his  life.  His <br/>peculiar  appearance  and  immoderate  system  of  living  were  always  held  against  him  by  his  adversaries. <br/>It  is  believed  that  his  physical  abnormalities  may  have  been  responsible  for  much  of  the  bitterness <br/>against  society  which  he  carried  with  him  throughout  all  his  intolerant  and  tempestuous  life. <br/><br/>His  reputed  intemperance  brought  upon  him  still  more  persecution,  for  it  was  asserted  that  even <br/>during  the  time  of  his  professorship  in  the  University  of  Basel  he  was  seldom  sober.  Such  an <br/>accusation  is  difficult  to  understand  in  view  of  the  marvelous  mental  clarity  for  which  he  was  noted  at <br/>all  times.  The  vast  amount  of  writing  which  he  accomplished  (the  Strassburg  Edition  of  his  collected <br/>works  is  in  three  large  volumes,  each  containing  several  hundred  pages)  is  a  monumental <br/>contradiction  of  the  tales  regarding  his  excessive  use  of  alcoholics. <br/><br/>No  doubt  many  of  the  vices  of  which  he  is  accused  were  sheer  inventions  by  his  enemies,  who,  not <br/>satisfied  with  hiring  assassins  to  murder  him,  sought  to  besmirch  his  memory  after  they  had <br/>revengefully  ended  his  life.  The  manner  in  which  Paracelsus  met  his  death  is  uncertain,  but:  the  most <br/>credible  account  is  that  he  died  as  the  indirect  result  of  a  scuffle  with  a  number  of  assassins  who  had <br/>been  hired  by  some  of  his  professional  enemies  to  make  away  with  the  one  who  had  exposed  their <br/>chicanery. <br/><br/>Few  manuscripts  are  extant  in  the  handwriting  of  Paracelsus,  for  he  dictated  the  majority  of  his  works <br/>to  his  disciples,  who  wrote  them  down.  Professor  John  Maxson  Stillman,  of  Stanford  University,  pays <br/>the  following  tribute  to  his  memory:  &quot;Whatever  be  the  final  judgment  as  to  the  relative  importance  of <br/>Paracelsus  in  the  upbuilding  of  medical  science  and  practice,  it  must  be  recognized  that  he  entered <br/>upon  his  career  at  Basel  with  the  zeal  and  the  self-assurance  of  one  who  believed  himself  inspired <br/>with  a  great  truth,  and  destined  to  effect  a  great  advance  in  the  science  and  practice  of  medicine.  By <br/>nature  he  was  a  keen  and  open-minded  observer  of  whatever  came  under  his  observation,  though <br/><br/><br/>probably  also  not  a  very  critical  analyst  of  the  observed  phenomena.  He  was  evidently  an  unusually <br/>self-reliant  and  independent  thinker,  though  the  degree  of  originality  in  his  thought  may  be  a  matter <br/>of  legitimate  differences  of  opinion.  Certainly  once  having,  from  whatever  combination  of  influences, <br/>made  up  his  mind  to  reject  the  sacredness  of  the  authority  of  Aristotle,  Galen  and  Avicenna,  and <br/>having  found  what  to  his  mind  was  a  satisfactory  substitute  for  the  ancient  dogmas  in  his  own <br/>modification  of  the  neo-Platonic  philosophy,  he  did  not  hesitate  to  burn  his  ships  behind  him. <br/><br/>&quot;Having  cut  loose  from  the  dominant  Galenism  of  his  time,  he  determined  to  preach  and  teach  that <br/>the  basis  of  the  medical  science  of  the  future  should  be  the  study  of  nature,  observation  of  the  patient, <br/>experiment  and  experience,  and  not  the  infallible  dogmas  of  authors  long  dead.  Doubtless  in  the  pride <br/>and  self-confidence  of  his  youthful  enthusiasm  he  did  not  rightly  estimate  the  tremendous  force  of <br/>conservatism  against  which  he  directed  his  assaults.  If  so,  his  experience  in  Basel  surely  undeceived <br/>him.  From  that  time  on  he  was  to  be  a  wanderer  again,  sometimes  in  great  poverty,  sometimes  in <br/>moderate  comfort,  but  manifestly  disillusioned  as  to  the  immediate  success  of  his  campaign  though <br/>never  in  doubt  as  to  its  ultimate  success&#x2014;for  to  his  mind  his  new  theories  and  practice  of  medicine <br/>were  at  one  with  the  forces  of  nature,  which  were  the  expression  of  God's  will,  and  eventually  they <br/>must  prevail.&quot; <br/><br/>This  strange  man,  his  nature  a  mass  of  contradictions,  his  stupendous  genius  shining  like  a  star <br/>through  the  philosophic  and  scientific  darkness  of  mediaeval  Europe,  struggling  against  the  jealousy <br/>of  his  colleagues  as  well  as  against  the  irascibility  of  his  own  nature,  fought  for  the  good  of  the  many <br/>against  the  domination  of  the  few.  He  was  the  first  man  to  write  scientific  books  in  the  language  of  the <br/>common  people  so  that  all  could  read  them. <br/><br/>Even  in  death  Paracelsus  found  no  rest.  Again  and  again  his  bones  were  dug  up  and  reinterred  in <br/>another  place.  The  slab  of  marble  over  his  grave  bears  the  following  inscription:  &quot;Here  lies  buried <br/>Philip  Theophrastus  the  famous  Doctor  of  Medicine  who  cured  Wounds,  Leprosy,  Gout,  Dropsy  and <br/>other  incurable  Maladies  of  the  Body,  with  wonderful  Knowledge  and  gave  his  Goods  to  be  divided <br/>and  distributed  to  the  Poor.  In  the  Year  1541  on  the  24th  day  of  September  he  exchanged  Life  for <br/>Death.  To  the  Living  Peace,  to  the  Sepulchred  Eternal  Rest.&quot; <br/><br/>A.  M.  Stoddart,  in  her  Life  of  Paracelsus,  gives  a  remarkable  testimonial  of  the  love  which  the  masses <br/>had  for  the  great  physician.  Referring  to  his  tomb,  she  writes:  &quot;To  this  day  the  poor  pray  there. <br/>Hohenheim's  memory  has  'blossomed  in  the  dust'  to  sainthood,  for  the  poor  have  canonized  him. <br/>When  cholera  threatened  Salzburg  in  1830,  the  people  made  a  pilgrimage  to  his  monument  and <br/>prayed  him  to  avert  it  from  their  homes.  The  dreaded  scourge  passed  away  from  them  and  raged  in <br/>Germany  and  the  rest  of  Austria.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>ALBERTUS  MAGNUS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Jovius'  Vitae  Illustrium  Virorum. <br/><br/>Albert  de  Groot  was  born  about  1206  and  died  at  the  age  of  74.  It  has  been  said  of  him  that  he  was  &quot;magnus  in  magia, <br/>major  in  philosophia,  maximus  in  theologia.&quot;  He  was  a  member  of  the  Dominican  order  and  the  mentor  of  St.  Thomas <br/>Aquinas  in  alchemy  and  philosophy.  Among  other  positions  of  dignity  occupied  by  Albertus  Magnus  was  that  of  Bishop  of <br/>Regensburg.  He  was  beatified  in  1622.  Albertus  was  an  Aristotelian  philosopher,  an  astrologer,  and  a  profound  student  of <br/>medicine  and  physics.  During  his  youth,  he  was  considered  of  deficient  mentality,  but  his  since  service  and  devotion  were <br/>rewarded  by  a  vision  in  which  the  Virgin  Mary  appeared  to  him  and  bestowed  upon  him  great  philosophical  and <br/>intellectual  powers.  Having  become  master  of  the  magical  sciences,  Albertus  began  the  construction  of  a  curious <br/>automaton,  which  he  invested  with  the  powers  of  speech  and  thought.  The  Android,  as  it  was  called,  was  composed  of <br/>metals  and  unknown  substances  chosen  according  to  the  stars  and  endued  with  spiritual  qualities  by  magical  formulae  and <br/>invocations,  and  the  labor  upon  it  consumed  over  thirty  years.  St.  Thomas  Aquinas,  thinking  the  device  to  be  a  diabolical <br/>mechanism,  destroyed  it,  thus  frustrating  the  labor  of  a  lifetime.  In  spite  of  this  act,  Albertus  Magnus  left  to  St.  Thomas <br/>Aquinas  his  alchemical  formulae,  including  (according  to  legend)  the  secret  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone. <br/><br/>On  one  occasion  Albertus  Magnus  invited  William  II,  Count  of  Holland  and  King  of  the  Romans,  to  a  garden  party  in <br/>midwinter.  The  ground  was  covered  with  snow,  but  Albertus,  had  prepare  a  sumptuous  banquet  in  the  open  grounds  of <br/>his  monastery  at  Cologne.  The  guests  were  amazed  at  the  imprudence  of  the  philosopher,  but  as  they  sat  down  to  eat <br/>Albertus,  uttered  a  few  words,  the  snow  disappeared,  the  garden  was  filled  with  flowers  and  singing  birds,  and  the  air  was <br/>warm  with  the  breezes  of  summer.  As  soon  as  the  feast  was  over,  the  snow  returned,  much  to  the  amazement  of  the <br/>assembled  nobles.  (For  details,  see  The  Lives  of  Alchemystical  Philosophers.) <br/><br/>P-151 <br/><br/>It  was  supposed  that  one  early  teacher  of  Paracelsus  was  a  mysterious  alchemist  who  called  himself <br/>Solomon  Trismosin.  Concerning  this  person  nothing  is  known  save  that  after  some  years  of <br/>wandering  he  secured  the  formula  of  transmutation  and  claimed  to  have  made  vast  amounts  of  gold. <br/>A  beautifully  illuminated  manuscript  of  this  author,  dated  1582  and  called  Splendor  Solis,  is  in  the <br/>British  Museum.  Trismosin  claimed  to  have  lived  to  the  age  of  150  as  the  result  of  his  knowledge  of <br/>alchemy.  One  very  significant  statement  appears  in  his  Alchemical  Wanderings,  which  work  is <br/>supposed  to  narrate  his  search  for  the  Philosopher's  Scone:  &quot;Study  what  thou  art,  whereof  thou  art  a <br/>part,  what  thou  knowest  of  this  art,  this  is  really  what  thou  art.  All  that  is  without  thee  also  is  within, <br/>thus  wrote  Trismosin.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>RAYMOND  LULLY <br/><br/><br/>This  most  famous  of  all  the  Spanish  alchemists  was  born  about  the  year  1235.  His  father  was <br/>seneschal  to  James  the  First  of  Aragon,  and  young  Raymond  was  brought  up  in  the  court  surrounded <br/>by  the  temptations  and  profligacy  abounding  in  such  places.  He  was  later  appointed  to  the  position <br/>which  his  father  had  occupied.  A  wealthy  marriage  ensured  Raymond's  financial  position,  and  he <br/>lived  the  life  of  a  grandee. <br/><br/>One  of  the  most  beautiful  women  at:  the  court  of  Aragon  was  Donna  Ambrosia  Eleanora  Di  Castello, <br/>whose  virtue  and  beauty  had  brought  her  great  renown.  She  was  at  that  time  married  and  was  not <br/>particularly  pleased  to  discover  that  young  Lully  was  rapidly  developing  a  passion  for  her.  Wherever <br/>she  went  Raymond  followed,  and  at  last  over  a  trivial  incident  he  wrote  some  very  amorous  verses  to <br/>her,  which  produced  an  effect  quite  different  from  what  he  had  expected.  He  received  a  message <br/>inviting  him  to  visit  the  lady.  He  responded  with  alacrity.  She  told  him  that  it  was  only  fair  that  he <br/>should  behold  more  of  the  beauty  concerning  which  he  wrote  such  appealing  poems  and,  drawing <br/>aside  part  of  her  garments,  disclosed  that  one  side  of  her  body  was  nearly  eaten  away  by  a  cancer. <br/>Raymond  never  recovered  from  the  shock.  It  turned  the  entire  course  of  his  life.  He  renounced  the <br/>frivolities  of  the  court  and  became  a  recluse. <br/><br/>Sometime  afterwards  while  doing  penance  for  his  worldly  sins  a  vision  appeared  to  him  in  which <br/>Christ  told  him  to  follow  in  the  direction  in  which  He  should  lead.  Later  the  vision  was  repeated. <br/>Hesitating  no  longer,  Raymond  divided  his  property  among  his  family  and  retired  to  a  hut  on  the  side <br/>of  a  hill,  where  he  devoted  himself  to  the  study  of  Arabic,  that  he  might  go  forth  and  convert  the <br/>infidels.  After  six  years  in  this  retreat  he  set  out  with  a  Mohammedan  servant,  who,  when  he  learned <br/>that  Raymond  was  about  to  attack  the  faith  of  his  people,  buried  his  knife  in  his  master's  back. <br/>Raymond  refused  to  allow  his  would-be  assassin  to  be  executed,  but  later  the  man  strangled  himself <br/>in  prison. <br/><br/>When  Raymond  regained  his  health  he  became  a  teacher  of  the  Arabic  language  to  those  who <br/>intended  traveling  in  the  Holy  Land.  It  was  while  so  engaged  that  he  came  in  contact:  with  Arnold  of <br/>Villa  Nova,  who  taught  him  the  principles  or  alchemy.  As  a  result  of  this  training,  Raymond  learned <br/>the  secret  of  the  transmutation  and  multiplication  of  metals.  His  life  of  wandering  continued,  and <br/>during  the  course  of  it  he  arrived  at  Tunis,  where  he  began  to  debate  with  the  Mohammedan  teachers, <br/>and  nearly  lost  his  life  as  the  result  of  his  fanatical  attacks  upon  their  religion.  He  was  ordered  to <br/>leave  the  country  and  never  to  return  again  upon  pain  of  death.  Notwithstanding  their  threats  he <br/>made  a  second  visit  to  Tunis,  but  the  inhabitants  instead  of  killing  him  merely  deported  him  to  Italy. <br/><br/>An  unsigned  article  appearing  in  Household  Words,  No.  273,  a  magazine  conducted  by  Charles <br/>Dickens,  throws  considerable  light  on  LuUy's  alchemical  ability.  &quot;Whilst  at  Vienna  he  [Lully]  received <br/>flattering  letters  from  Edward  the  Second,  King  of  England,  and  from  Robert  Bruce,  King  of  Scotland, <br/>entreating  him  to  visit  them.  He  had  also,  in  the  course  of  his  travels,  met  with  John  Cremer,  Abbot  of <br/>Westminster,  with  whom  he  formed  a  strong  friendship;  and  it  was  more  to  please  him  than  the  king, <br/>that  Raymond  consented  to  go  to  England.  [A  tract  by  John  Cremer  appears  in  the  Hermetic  Museum, <br/>but  there  is  no  record  in  the  annals  of  Westminster  of  anyone  by  that  name.]  Cremer  had  an  intense <br/>desire  to  learn  the  last  great  secret  of  alchemy&#x2014;to  make  the  powder  of  transmutation&#x2014;and  Raymond, <br/>with  all  his  friendship,  had  never  disclosed  it.  Cremer,  however,  set  to  work  very  cunningly;  he  was <br/>not  long  in  discovering  the  object  that  was  nearest  to  Raymond's  heart&#x2014;the  conversion  of  the  infidels. <br/>He  told  the  king  wonderful  stories  of  the  gold  Lully  had  the  art  to  make;  and  he  worked  upon <br/>Raymond  by  the  hope  that  King  Edward  would  be  easily  induced  to  raise  a  crusade  against  the <br/>Mahommedans,  if  he  had  the  means. <br/><br/>&quot;Raymond  had  appealed  so  often  to  popes  and  kings  that  he  had  lost  all  faith  in  them;  nevertheless,  as <br/>a  last  hope,  he  accompanied  his  friend  Cremer  to  England.  Cremer  lodged  him  in  his  abbey,  treating <br/><br/><br/>him  with  distinction;  and  there  LuUy  at  last  instructed  him  in  the  powder,  the  secret  of  which  Cremer <br/>had  so  long  desired  to  know.  When  the  powder  was  perfected,  Cremer  presented  him  to  the  king,  who <br/>received  him  as  a  man  may  be  supposed  to  receive  one  who  could  give  him  boundless  riches. <br/>Raymond  made  only  one  condition;  that  the  gold  he  made  should  not  be  expended  upon  the  luxuries <br/>of  the  court  or  upon  a  war  with  any  Christian  king;  and  that  Edward  himself  should  go  in  person  with <br/>an  army  against  the  infidels.  Edward  promised  everything  and  anjlihing. <br/><br/>&quot;Raymond  had  apartments  assigned  him  in  the  Tower,  and  there  he  tells  us  he  transmuted  fifty <br/>thousand  pounds  weight  of  quicksilver,  lead,  and  tin  into  pure  gold,  which  was  coined  at  the  mint  into <br/>six  million  of  nobles,  each  worth  about  three  pounds  sterling  at  the  present  day.  Some  of  the  pieces <br/>said  to  have  been  coined  out  of  this  gold  are  still  to  be  found  in  antiquarian  collections.  [While <br/>desperate  attempts  have  been  made  to  disprove  these  statements,  the  evidence  is  still  about  equally <br/>divided.]  To  Robert  Bruce  he  sent  a  little  work  entitled  Of  the  Art  of  Transmuting  Metals.  Dr. <br/>Edmund  Dickenson  relates  that  when  the  cloister  which  Raymond  occupied  at  Westminster  was <br/>removed,  the  workmen  found  some  of  the  powder,  with  which  they  enriched  themselves. <br/><br/>&quot;During  LuUy's  residence  in  England,  he  became  the  friend  of  Roger  Bacon.  Nothing,  of  course,  could <br/>be  further  from  King  Edward's  thoughts  than  to  go  on  a  crusade.  Raymond's  apartments  in  the  Tower <br/>were  only  an  honorable  prison;  and  he  soon  perceived  how  matters  were.  He  declared  that  Edward <br/>would  meet  with  nothing  but  misfortune  and  misery  for  his  breach  of  faith.  He  made  his  escape  from <br/>England  in  1315,  and  set  off  once  more  to  preach  to  the  infidels.  He  was  now  a  very  old  man,  and  none <br/>of  his  friends  could  ever  hope  to  see  his  face  again. <br/><br/>&quot;He  went  first  to  Egypt,  then  to  Jerusalem,  and  thence  to  Tunis  a  third  time.  There  he  at  last  met  with <br/>the  martyrdom  he  had  so  often  braved.  The  people  fell  upon  him  and  stoned  him.  Some  Genoese <br/>merchants  carried  away  his  body,  in  which  they  discerned  some  feeble  signs  of  life.  They  carried  him <br/>on  board  their  vessel;  but,  though  he  lingered  awhile,  he  died  as  they  came  in  sight  of  Majorca,  on  the <br/>28th  of  June,  1315,  at  the  age  of  eighty-one.  He  was  buried  with  great  honour  in  his  family  chapel  at <br/>St.  Ulma,  the  viceroy  and  all  the  principal  nobility  attending.&quot; <br/><br/>NICHOLAS  FLAMMEL <br/><br/>In  the  latter  part  of  the  fourteenth  century  there  lived  in  Paris  one  whose  business  was  that  of <br/>illuminating  manuscripts  and  preparing  deeds  and  documents.  To  Nicholas  Flammel  the  world  is <br/>indebted  for  its  knowledge  of  a  most  remarkable  volume,  which  he  bought  for  a  paltry  sum  from  some <br/>bookdealer  with  whom  his  profession  of  scrivener  brought  him  in  contact.

ANGLT.  OELDI- <br/><br/>NIS  0ENEDICTINL <br/><br/>TRACTATVS  TERT/VS. <br/><br/><br/>TITLE  PAGE  OF  ALCHEMICAL  TRACT  ATTRIBUTED  TO  JOHN  CREMER. <br/><br/>From  Musseum  Hermeticum  Reformatum  et  Amplificatum. <br/><br/>John  Cremer,  the  mythical  Abbot  of  Westminster,  is  an  interesting  personahty  in  the  alchemical  imbroglio  of  the <br/>fourteenth  century.  As  it  is  not  reasonably  certain  that  m  abbot  by  such  a  name  ever  occupied  the  See  of  Westminster,  the <br/>question  naturally  arises,  &quot;Who  was  the  person  concealing  his  identity  under  the  Pseudonym  of  John  Cremer?&quot;  Fictitious <br/>characters  such  as  John  Cremer  illustrate  two  important  practices  of  mediaeval  alchemists:  (i)  many  persons  of  high <br/>political  or  religious  rank  were  secretly  engaged  in  Hermetic  chemical  research  but,  fearing  persecution  and  ridicule, <br/>published  their  findings  under  various  pseudonyms;  (2)  for  thousands  of  years  it  was  the  practice  of  those  initiates  who <br/>possessed  the  true  key  to  the  great  Hermetic  arcanum  to  perpetuate  their  wisdom  by  creating  imaginary  persons, <br/>involving  them  in  episodes  of  contemporaneous  history  and  thus  establishing  these  beings  as  prominent  members  of <br/>society&#x2014;in  some  cases  even  fabricating  complete  genealogies  to  attain  that  end.  The  names  by  which  these  fictitious <br/>characters  were  known  revealed  nothing  to  the  uniformed.  To  the  initiated,  however,  they  signified  that  the  personality  to <br/>which  they  were  assigned  had  no  existence  other  than  a  symbolic  one.  These  initiated  chroniclers  carefully  concealed  their <br/>arcanum  in  the  lives,  thoughts,  words,  and  acts  ascribed  to  these  imaginary  persons  and  thus  safely  transmitted  through <br/>the  ages  the  deepest  secrets  of  occultism  as  writings  which  to  the  unconversant  were  nothing  more  than  biographies. <br/><br/>P152 <br/><br/>in  his  own  words  as  preserved  in  his  Hieroglyphical  Figures:  &quot;Whilst  therefore,  I  Nicholas  Flammel, <br/>Notary,  after  the  decease  of  my  parents,  got  my  living  at  our  art  of  writing,  by  making  inventories, <br/>dressing  accounts,  and  summing  up  the  expenses  of  tutors  and  pupils,  there  fell  into  my  hands  for  the <br/>sum  of  two  florins,  a  guilded  book,  very  old  and  large.  It  was  not  of  paper,  nor  of  parchment,  as  other <br/>books  be,  but  was  only  made  of  delicate  rinds  (as  it  seemed  to  me)  of  tender  young  trees.  The  cover  of <br/>it  was  of  brass,  well  bound,  all  engraven  with  letters,  or  strange  figures;  and  for  my  part  I  think  they <br/>might  well  be  Greek  characters,  or  some  such  like  ancient  language.  Sure  I  am.  I  could  not  read  them, <br/>and  I  know  well  they  were  not  notes  nor  letters  of  the  Latin  nor  of  the  Gaul,  for  of  them  we <br/>understand  a  little. <br/><br/>&quot;As  for  that  which  was  within  it,  the  leaves  of  bark  or  rind,  were  engraven  and  with  admirable <br/>diligence  written,  with  a  point  of  iron,  in  fair  and  neat  Latin  letters  colored.  It  contained  thrice  seven <br/><br/><br/>leaves,  for  so  were  they  counted  in  the  top  of  the  leaves,  and  always  every  seventh  leaf  there  was <br/><br/>painted  a  virgin  and  serpent  swallowing  her  up.  In  the  second  seventh,  a  cross  where  a  serpent  was <br/>crucified;  and  the  last  seventh,  there  were  painted  deserts,  or  wildernesse,  in  the  midst  whereof  ran <br/>many  fair  fountains,  from  whence  there  issued  out  a  number  of  serpents,  which  ran  up  and  down  here <br/>and  there.  Upon  the  first  of  the  leaves,  was  written  in  great  capital  letters  of  gold,  Abraham  the  Jew, <br/>Prince,  Priest,  Levite,  Astrologer,  and  Philosopher,  to  the  Nation  of  the  Jews,  by  the  Wrath  of  God <br/>dispersed  among  the  Gauls,  sendeth  Health.  After  this  it  was  filled  with  great  execrations  and  curses <br/>(with  this  word  Maranatha,  which  was  often  repeated  there)  against  every  person  that  should  cast  his <br/>eyes  upon  it,  if  he  were  not  Sacrificer  or  Scribe. <br/><br/>&quot;He  that  sold  me  this  book  knew  not  what  it  was  worth  nor  more  than  I  when  I  bought  it;  I  believe  it <br/>had  been  stolen  or  taken  from  the  miserable  Jews,  or  found  in  some  part  of  the  ancient  place  of  their <br/>abode.  Within  the  book,  in  the  second  leaf,  he  comforted  his  nation,  counselling  them  to  fly  vices,  and <br/>above  all  idolatry,  attending  with  sweet  patience  the  coming  of  the  Messias,  Who  should  vanquish  all <br/>the  kings  of  the  earth  and  should  reign  with  His  people  in  glory  eternally.  Without  doubt  this  had <br/>been  some  very  wise  and  understanding  man. <br/><br/>&quot;In  the  third  leaf,  and  in  all  the  other  writings  that  followed,  to  help  his  captive  nation  to  pay  their <br/>tributes  unto  the  Roman  emperors,  and  to  do  other  things,  which  I  will  not  speak  of,  he  taught  them <br/>in  common  words  the  transmutation  of  metals;  he  painted  the  vessels  by  the  sides,  and  he  advertised <br/>them  of  the  colors,  and  of  all  the  rest,  saving  of  the  first  agent,  of  the  which  he  spake  not  a  word,  but <br/>only  (as  he  said)  in  the  fourth  and  fifth  leaves  entire  he  painted  it,  and  figured  it  with  very  great <br/>cunning  and  workman  ship:  for  although  it  was  well  and  intelligibly  figured  and  painted,  yet  no  man <br/>could  ever  have  been  able  to  understand  it,  without  being  well  skilled  in  their  Cabala,  which  goeth  by <br/>tradition,  and  without  having  well  studied  their  books. <br/><br/>&quot;The  fourth  and  fifth  leaves  therefore,  were  without  any  writing,  all  full  of  fair  figures  enlightened,  or <br/>as  it  were  enlightened,  for  the  work  was  very  exquisite.  First  he  painted  a  young  man  with  wings  at  his <br/>ancles,  having  in  his  hand  a  Caducean  rod,  writhen  about  with  two  serpents,  wherewith  he  struck <br/>upon  a  helmet  which  covered  his  head.  He  seemed  to  my  small  judgment,  to  be  the  God  Mercury  of <br/>the  pagans:  against  him  there  came  running  and  flying  with  open  wings,  a  great  old  man,  who  upon <br/>his  head  had  an  hour  glass  fastened,  and  in  his  hand  a  book  (or  syrhe)  like  death,  with  the  which,  in <br/>terrible  and  furious  manner,  he  would  have  cut  off  the  feet  of  Mercury.  On  the  other  side  of  the  fourth <br/>leaf,  he  painted  a  fair  flower  on  the  top  of  a  very  high  mountain  which  was  sore  shaken  with  the  North <br/>wind;  it  had  the  foot  blue,  the  flowers  white  and  red,  the  leaves  shining  like  fine  gold:  and  round <br/>about  it  the  dragons  and  griffons  of  the  North  made  their  nests  and  abode. <br/><br/>&quot;On  the  fifth  leaf  there  was  a  fair  rose  tree  flowered  in  the  midst  of  a  sweet  garden,  climbing  up <br/>against  a  hollow  oak;  at  the  foot  whereof  boiled  a  fountain  of  most  white  water,  which  ran  headlong <br/>down  into  the  depths,  notwithstanding  it  first  passed  among  the  hands  of  infinite  people,  who  digged <br/>in  the  earth  seeking  for  it;  but  because  they  were  blind,  none  of  them  knew  it,  except  here  and  there <br/>one  who  considered  the  weight.  On  the  last  side  of  the  fifth  leaf  there  was  a  king  with  a  great  fauchion, <br/>who  made  to  be  killed  in  his  presence  by  some  soldiers  a  great  multitude  of  little  infants,  whose <br/>mothers  wept  at  the  feet  of  the  unpitiful  soldiers:  the  blood  of  which  infants  was  afterwards  by  other <br/>soldiers  gathered  up,  and  put  in  a  great  vessel,  wherein  the  sun  and  the  moon  came  to  bathe <br/>themselves. <br/><br/>&quot;And  because  that  this  history  did  represent  the  more  part  of  that  of  the  innocents  slain  by  Herod, <br/>and  that  in  this  book  I  learned  the  greatest  part  of  the  art,  this  was  one  of  the  causes  why  I  placed  in <br/>their  church-yard  these  Hieroglyphic  Symbols  of  this  secret  science.  And  thus  you  see  that  which  was <br/>in  the  first  five  leaves. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;I  will  not  represent  unto  you  that  which  was  written  in  good  and  intelligible  Latin  in  all  the  other <br/><br/>written  leaves,  for  God  would  punish  me,  because  I  should  commit  a  greater  wickedness,  than  he  who <br/>(as  it  is  said)  wished  that  all  the  men  of  the  World  had  but  one  head  that  he  might  cut  it  off  with  one <br/>blow.  Having  with  me  therefore  this  fair  book,  I  did  nothing  else  day  nor  night,  but  study  upon  it, <br/>understanding  very  well  all  the  operations  that  it  showed,  but  not  knowing  with  what  matter  I  should <br/>begin,  which  made  me  very  heavy  and  solitary,  and  caused  me  to  fetch  many  a  sigh.  My  wife <br/>Perrenella,  whom  I  loved  as  myself,  and  had  lately  married  was  much  astonished  at  this,  comforting <br/>me,  and  earnestly  demanding,  if  she  could  by  any  means  deliver  me  from  this  trouble.  I  could  not <br/>possibly  hold  my  tongue,  but  told  her  all,  and  showed  this  fair  book,  whereof  at  the  same  instant  that <br/>she  saw  it,  she  became  as  much  enamoured  as  myself,  taking  extreme  pleasure  to  behold  the  fair <br/>cover,  gravings,  images,  and  portraits,  whereof  notwithstanding  she  understood  as  little  as  I:  yet  it <br/>was  a  great  comfort  to  me  to  talk  with  her,  and  to  entertain  myself,  what  we  should  do  to  have  the <br/>interpretation  of  them.&quot; <br/><br/>Nicholas  Flammel  spent  many  years  studying  the  mysterious  book.  He  even  painted  the  pictures  from <br/>it  all  over  the  walls  of  his  house  and  made  numerous  copies  which  he  showed  to  the  learned  men  with <br/>whom  he  came  in  contact,  but  none  could  explain  their  secret  significance.  At  last  he  determined  to  go <br/>forth  in  quest  of  an  adept,  or  wise  man,  and  after  many  wanderings  he  met  a  physician&#x2014;by  name <br/>Master  Canches~who  was  immediately  interested  in  the  diagrams  and  asked  to  see  the  original  book. <br/>They  started  forth  together  for  Paris,  and  or,  the  way  the  physician  adept  explained  many  of  the <br/>principles  of  the  hieroglyphics  to  Flammel,  but  before  they  reached  their  journey's  end  Master <br/>Canches  was  taken  ill  and  died.  Flammel  buried  him  at  Orleans,  but  having  meditated  deeply  on  the <br/>information  he  had  secured  during  their  brief  acquaintance,  he  was  able,  with  the  assistance  of  his <br/>wife,  to  work  out  the  formula  for  transmuting  base  metals  into  gold.  He  performed  the  experiment <br/>several  times  with  perfect  success,  and  before  his  death  caused  a  number  of  hieroglyphic  figures  to  be <br/>painted  upon  an  arch  of  St.  Innocent's  churchyard  in  Paris,  wherein  he  concealed  the  entire  formula <br/>as  it  had  been  revealed  to  him  from  the  Book  of  Abraham  the  Jew. <br/><br/>COUNT  BERNARD  OF  TREVISO <br/><br/>Of  all  those  who  sought  for  the  Elixir  of  Life  and  the  Philosopher's  Scone,  few  passed  through  the <br/>chain  of  disappointments  that  beset  Count  Bernard  of  Treviso,  who  was  born  in  Padua  in  1406  and <br/>died  in  1490.  His  search  for  the  Philosopher's  Stone  and  the  secret  of  the  transmutation  of  metals <br/>began  when  he  was  but  fourteen  years  of  age.  He  spent  not  only  a  lifetime  but  also  a  fortune  in  his <br/>quest.  Count  Bernard  went  from  one  alchemist  and  philosopher  to  another,  each  of  whom  unfolded <br/>some  pet  theorem  which  he  eagerly  accepted  and  experimented  with  but  always  without  the  desired <br/>result.  His  family  believed  him  to  be  mad  and  declared  that  he  was  disgracing  his  house  by  his <br/>experiments,  which  were  rapidly  reducing  him  to  a  state  of  penury.  He  traveled  in  many  countries, <br/>hoping  that  in  distant  places  he  would  find  wise  men  capable  of  assisting  him.  At  last  as  he  was <br/>approaching  his  seventy-sixth  year,  he  was  rewarded  with  success.  The  great  secrets  of  the  Elixir  of <br/>Life,  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  and  the  transmutation  of  metals  were  revealed  to  him.  He  wrote  a  little <br/>book  describing  the  results  of  his  labors,  and  while  he  lived  only  a  few  years  to  enjoy  the  fruitage  of <br/>his  discovery  he  was  thoroughly  satisfied  that  the  treasure  he  had  found  was  worth  the  lifetime  spent <br/>in  search  of  it.  An  example  of  the  industry  and  perseverance  displayed  by  him  is  to  be  found  in  one  of <br/>the  processes  which  some  foolish  pretender  coaxed  him  to  attempt  and  which  resulted  in  his <br/>spending  twenty  years  calcining  egg  shells  and  nearly  an  equal  period  distilling  alcohol  and  other <br/>substances.  In  the  history  of  alchemical  research  there  never  was  a  more  patient  and  persevering <br/>disciple  of  the  Great  Arcanum. <br/><br/>Bernard  declared  the  process  of  dissolution,  accomplished  not  with  fire  but  with  mercury,  to  be  the <br/>supreme  secret  of  alchemy, <br/><br/><br/>THE  SYMBOLS  OF  ABRAHAM  THE  JEW. <br/><br/><br/>From  Flammel's  Hieroglyphical  Figures. <br/><br/><br/>Robert  H.  Fryar,  in  a  footnote  to  his  reprint  of  the  Hieroglyphical  Figures  by  Nicholas  Flammel,  says:  &quot;One  thing  which <br/>seems  to  prove  the  reality  of  this  story  beyond  dispute,  is,  that  this  very  book  of  Abraham  the  Jew,  with  the  annotations  of <br/>'Flammel,'  who  wrote  from  the  instructions  he  received  from  this  physician,  was  actually  in  the  hands  of  Cardinal <br/>Richelieu,  as  Borel  was  told  by  the  Count  de  Cabrines,  who  saw  and  examined  it.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>P153 <br/><br/><br/>The  Theory  and  Practice  of  Alchemy <br/><br/>Part  One <br/><br/>ALCHEMY,  the  secret  art  of  the  land  of  Khem,  is  one  of  the  two  oldest  sciences  known  to  the  world. <br/>The  other  is  astrology.  The  beginnings  of  both  extend  back  into  the  obscurity  of  prehistoric  times. <br/>According  to  the  earliest  records  extant,  alchemy  and  astrology  were  considered  as  divinely  revealed <br/>to  man  so  that  by  their  aid  he  might  regain  his  lost  estate.  According  to  old  legends  preserved  by  the <br/>Rabbins,  the  angel  at  the  gate  of  Eden  instructed  Adam  in  the  mysteries  of  Qabbalah  and  of  alchemy, <br/>promising  that  when  the  human  race  had  thoroughly  mastered  the  secret  wisdom  concealed  v^dthin <br/>these  inspired  arts,  the  curse  of  the  forbidden  fruit  would  be  removed  and  man  might  again  enter  into <br/>the  Garden  of  the  Lord.  As  man  took  upon  himself  &quot;coats  of  skins&quot;  (physical  bodies)  at  the  time  of  his <br/>fall,  so  these  sacred  sciences  were  brought  by  him  into  the  lower  worlds  incarnated  in  dense  vehicles, <br/>through  which  their  spiritual  transcendental  natures  could  no  longer  manifest  themselves.  Therefore <br/>they  were  considered  as  being  dead  or  lost. <br/><br/>The  earthly  body  of  alchemy  is  chemistry,  for  chemists  do  not  realize  that  half  of  The  Book  ofTorah  is <br/>forever  concealed  behind  the  veil  of  Isis  (see  the  Tarot),  and  that  so  long  as  they  study  only  material <br/>elements  they  can  at  best  discover  but  half  of  the  mystery.  Astrology  has  crystallized  into  astronomy, <br/>whose  votaries  ridicule  the  dreams  of  ancient  seers  and  sages,  deriding  their  symbols  as  meaningless <br/>products  of  superstition.  Nevertheless,  the  intelligentsia  of  the  modern  world  can  never  pass  behind <br/>the  veil  which  divides  the  seen  from  the  unseen  except  in  the  way  appointed~f/ie  Mysteries. <br/><br/>What  is  life?  What  is  intelligence?  What  is  force?  These  are  the  problems  to  the  solution  of  which  the <br/>ancients  consecrated  their  temples  of  learning.  Who  shall  say  that  they  did  not  answer  those <br/>questions?  Who  would  recognize  the  answers  if  given?  Is  it  possible  that  under  the  symbols  of <br/>alchemy  and  astrology  lies  concealed  a  wisdom  so  abstruse  that  the  mind  of  this  race  is  not  qualified <br/>to  conceive  its  principles? <br/><br/>The  Chaldeans,  Phoenicians,  and  Babylonians  were  familiar  with  the  principles  of  alchemy,  as  were <br/>many  early  Oriental  races.  It  was  practiced  in  Greece  and  Rome;  was  the  master  science  of  the <br/>Egyptians.  Khem  was  an  ancient  name  for  the  land  of  Egypt;  and  both  the  words  alchemy  and <br/>chemistry  are  a  perpetual  reminder  of  the  priority  of  Egypt's  scientific  knowledge.  According  to  the <br/>fragmentary  writings  of  those  early  peoples,  alchemy  was  to  them  no  speculative  art.  They  implicitly <br/>believed  in  the  multiplication  of  metals;  and  in  the  face  of  their  reiterations  both  the  scholar  and  the <br/>materialist  should  be  more  kindly  in  their  consideration  of  alchemical  theorems.  Evolutionists  trace <br/>the  unfoldment  of  the  arts  and  sciences  up  through  the  growing  intelligence  of  the  prehistoric  man, <br/>while  others,  of  a  transcendental  point  of  view,  like  to  consider  them  as  being  direct  revelations  from <br/>God. <br/><br/>Many  interesting  solutions  to  the  riddle  of  alchemy's  origin  have  been  advanced.  One  is  that  alchemy <br/>was  revealed  to  man  by  the  mysterious  Egyptian  demigod  Hermes  Trismegistus.  This  sublime  figure, <br/>looming  through  the  mists  of  time  and  bearing  in  his  hand  the  immortal  Emerald,  is  credited  by  the <br/>Egyptians  as  being  the  author  of  all  the  arts  and  sciences.  In  honor  of  him  all  scientific  knowledge  was <br/>gathered  under  the  general  title  of  The  Hermetic  Arts.  When  the  body  of  Hermes  was  interred  in  the <br/>Valley  of  Ebron  (or  Hebron),  the  divine  Emerald  was  buried  with  it.  Many  centuries  afterward  the <br/>Emerald  was  discovered&#x2014;according  to  one  version,  by  an  Arabian  initiate;  according  to  another,  by <br/>Alexander  the  Great,  King  of  Macedon.  By  means  of  the  power  of  this  Emerald,  upon  which  were  the <br/>mysterious  inscriptions  of  the  Thrice  Great  Hermes&#x2014;thirteen  sentences  in  all&#x2014; Alexander  conquered <br/>all  the  then  known  world.  Not  having  conquered  himself,  however,  he  ultimately  failed.  Regardless  of <br/><br/><br/>his  glory  and  power,  the  prophecies  of  the  talking  trees  were  fulfilled,  and  Alexander  was  cut  down  in <br/>the  midst  of  his  triumph.  (There  are  persistent  rumors  to  the  effect  that  Alexander  was  an  initiate  of <br/>high  order  who  failed  because  of  his  inability  to  withstand  the  temptations  of  power.) <br/><br/>E.  Y.  Kenealy,  quoting  from  the  Cosmodromium  of  Doctor  Gobelin  Persona,  describes  the  incident  of <br/>Alexander  and  the  talking  trees,  into  the  presence  of  which  the  King  of  Macedon  is  said  to  have  been <br/>brought  while  on  his  campaign  in  India:  &quot;And  now  Alexander  marched  into  other  quarters  equally <br/>dangerous;  at  one  time  over  the  tops  of  mountains,  at  another  through  dark  valleys,  in  which  his  army <br/>was  attacked  by  serpents  and  wild  beasts,  until  after  three  hundred  days  he  came  into  a  most  pleasant <br/>mountain,  on  whose  sides  hung  chains  or  ropes  of  gold.  This  mountain  had  two  thousand  and  fifty <br/>steps  all  of  purest  sapphire,  by  which  one  could  ascend  to  the  summit,  and  near  this  Alexander <br/>encamped.  And  on  a  day,  Alexander  with  his  Twelve  Princes,  ascended  by  the  aforenamed  steps  to  the <br/>top  of  the  Mountain,  and  found  there  a  Palace  marvellously  beautiful,  having  Twelve  Gates,  and <br/>seventy  windows  of  the  purest  gold,  and  it  was  called  the  Palace  of  the  Sun,  and  there  was  in  it  a <br/>Temple  all  of  gold,  before  whose  gates  were  vine  trees  bearing  bunches  of  carbuncles  and  pearls,  and <br/>Alexander  and  his  Princes  having  entered  the  Palace,  found  there  a  Man  lying  on  a  golden  bedstead; <br/>he  was  very  stately  and  beautiful  in  appearance,  and  his  head  and  beard  were  white  as  snow.  Then <br/>Alexander  and  his  princes  bent  the  knee  to  the  Sage  who  spake  thus:  'Alexander,  thou  shalt  now  see <br/>what  no  earthly  man  hath  ever  before  seen  or  heard.'  To  whom  Alexander  made  answer:  'O,  Sage, <br/>most  happy,  how  dost  thou  know  me?'  He  replied:  'Before  the  wave  of  the  Deluge  covered  the  face  of <br/>the  earth  I  knew  thy  works.'  He  added:  'Wouldst  thou  behold  the  most  hallowed  Trees  of  the  Sun  and <br/>Moon,  which  announce  all  future  things?'  Alexander  made  answer:  'It  is  well,  my  lord;  greatly  do  we <br/>long  to  see  them.'  *  *  * <br/><br/>&quot;Then  the  Sage  said:  'Put  away  your  rings  and  ornaments,  and  take  off  your  shoes,  and  follow  me.' <br/>And  Alexander  did  so,  and  choosing  out  three  from  the  Princes,  and  leaving  the  rest  to  await  his <br/>return,  he  followed  the  Sage,  and  came  to  the  Trees  of  the  Sun  and  Moon.  The  Tree  of  the  Sun  has <br/>leaves  of  red  gold,  the  Tree  of  the  Moon  has  leaves  of  silver,  and  they  are  very  great,  and  Alexander,  at <br/>the  suggestion  of  the  Sage  questioned  the  Trees,  asking  if  he  should  return  in  triumph  to  Macedon?  to <br/>which  the  Trees  gave  answer.  No,  but  that  he  should  live  yet  another  year  and  eight  months,  after <br/>which  he  should  die  by  a  poisoned  cup.  And  when  he  inquired,  Who  was  he  who  should  give  him  that <br/>poison?  he  received  no  reply,  and  the  Tree  of  the  Moon  said  to  him,  that  his  Mother,  after  a  most <br/>shameful  and  unhappy  death,  should  lie  long  unburied,  but  that  happiness  was  in  store  for  his <br/>sisters.&quot;  (See  The  Book  of  Enoch,  The  Second  Messenger  of  God.) <br/><br/>In  all  probability,  the  so-called  talking  trees  were  merely  strips  of  wood  with  tables  of  letters  upon <br/>them,  by  means  of  which  oracles  were  evoked.  At  one  time  books  written  upon  wood  were  called <br/>&quot;talking  trees.&quot;  The  difficulty  in  deciding  the  origin  of  alchemy  is  directly  due  to  ignoring  the  lost <br/>continent  of  Atlantis.  The  Great  Arcanum  was  the  most  prized  of  the  secrets  of  the  Atlantean <br/>priestcraft.  When  the  land  of  Atlas  sank,  hierophants  of  the  Fire  Mystery  brought  the  formula  to <br/>Egypt,  where  it  remained  for  centuries  in  the  possession  of  the  sages  and  philosophers.  It  gradually <br/>moved  into  Europe,  where  its  secrets  are  still  preserved  intact. <br/><br/><br/>THE  LEAVES  OF  HERMES'  SACRED  TREE. <br/><br/>Redrawn  from  an  original  manuscript  dated  1577. <br/><br/><br/>In  his  Key  to  Alchemy,  Samuel  Norton  divides  into  fourteen  parts  the  processes  or  states  through  which  the  alchemical <br/>substances  pass  from  the  time  they  are  first  placed  in  the  test  tube  until  ready  as  medicine  for  plants,  minerals,  or  men: <br/><br/>1.  Solution,  the  act  of  passing  from  a  gaseous  or  solid  condition,  into  one  of  liquidity. <br/><br/>2.  Filtration,  the  mechanical  separation  of  a  liquid  from  the  undissolved  particles  suspended  in  it. <br/><br/>3.  Evaporation,  the  changing  or  converting  from  a  liquid  or  solid  state  into  a  vaporous  state  with  the  aid  of  heat. <br/><br/>4.  Distillation,  an  operation  by  which  a  volatile  liquid  may  be  separated  from  substances  which  it  holds  in  solution. <br/><br/>5.  Separation,  the  operation  of  disuniting  or  decomposing  substances. <br/><br/>6.  Rectification,  the  process  of  refining  or  purifying  any  substance  by  repeated  distillation. <br/><br/>7.  Calcination,  the  conversion  into  a  powder  or  calx  by  the  action  of  heat;  expulsion  of  the  volatile  substance  from  a <br/>matter. <br/><br/>8.  Commixtion,  the  blending  of  different  ingredients  into  new  compounds  or  mass. <br/><br/>9.  Purification  (through  putrefaction),  disintegration  by  spontaneous  decomposition;  decay  by  artificial  means. <br/><br/>10.  Inhibition,  the  process  of  holding  back  or  restraining. <br/><br/>11.  Fermentation,  the  conversion  of  organic  substances  into  new  compounds  in  the  presence  of  a  ferment. <br/><br/>12.  Fixation,  the  act  or  process  of  ceasing  to  be  a  fluid  and  becoming  firm;  state  of  being  fixed. <br/><br/>13.  Multiplication,  the  act  or  process  of  multiplying  or  increasing  in  number,  the  state  of  being  multiplied. <br/><br/>14.  Projection,  the  process  of  turning  the  base  Metals  into  gold. <br/>P154 <br/><br/>Those  disagreeing  with  the  legend  of  Hermes  and  his  Emerald  Tablet  see  in  the  two  hundred  angels <br/>who  descended  upon  the  mountains,  as  described  by  the  Prophet:  Enoch,  the  first  instructors  in  the <br/>alchemical  art.  Regardless  of  its  originator,  it  was  left  to  the  Egyptian  priests  to  preserve  alchemy  for <br/>the  modern  world.  Egypt,  because  of  the  color  of  its  earth,  was  called  &quot;the  black  empire&quot;  and  is <br/>referred  to  in  the  Old  Testament  as  &quot;the  land  of  darkness.&quot;  By  reason  of  its  possible  origin  there, <br/>alchemy  has  long  been  known  as  &quot;the  black  art, &quot;  not  in  the  sense  of  evil  but  in  the  sense  of  that <br/>darkness  which  has  always  enshrouded  its  secret  processes. <br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages,  alchemy  was  not  only  a  philosophy  and  a  science  but  also  a  religion.  Those <br/>who  rebelled  against  the  religious  limitations  of  their  day  concealed  their  philosophic  teachings  under <br/>the  allegory  of  gold-making.  In  this  way  they  preserved  their  personal  liberty  and  were  ridiculed <br/>rather  than  persecuted.  Alchemy  is  a  threefold  art,  its  mystery  well  symbolized  by  a  triangle.  Its <br/>symbol  is  3  times  3~three  elements  or  processes  in  three  worlds  or  spheres.  The  3  times  3  is  part  of <br/>the  mystery  of  the  33rd  degree  of  Freemasonry,  for  33  is  3  times  3,  which  is  9,  the  number  of  esoteric <br/>man  and  the  number  of  emanations  from  the  root  of  the  Divine  Tree.  It  is  the  number  of  worlds <br/>nourished  by  the  four  rivers  that  pour  out  of  the  Divine  Mouth  as  the  verbum  fiat.  Beneath  the  so- <br/>called  symbolism  of  alchemy  is  concealed  a  magnificent  concept,  for  this  ridiculed  and  despised  craft <br/>still  preserves  intact  the  triple  key  to  the  gates  of  eternal  life.  Realizing,  therefore,  that  alchemy  is  a <br/>mystery  in  three  worlds&#x2014;the  divine,  the  human,  and  the  elemental&#x2014;it  can  easily  be  appreciated  why <br/>the  sages  and  philosophers  created  and  evolved  an  intricate  allegory  to  conceal  their  wisdom. <br/><br/><br/>Alchemy  is  the  science  of  multipHcation  and  is  based  upon  the  natural  phenomenon  of  growth. <br/><br/>&quot;Nothing  from  nothing  comes,&quot;  is  an  extremely  ancient  adage.  Alchemy  is  not  the  process  of  making <br/>something  from  nothing;  it  is  the  process  of  increasing  and  improving  that  which  already  exists.  If  a <br/>philosopher  were  to  state  that  a  living  man  could  be  made  from  a  stone,  the  unenlightened  would <br/>probably  exclaim,  &quot;Impossible!&quot;  Thus  would  they  reveal  their  ignorance,  for  to  the  wise  it  is  known <br/>that  in  every  stone  is  the  seed  of  man.  A  philosopher  might  declare  that  a  universe  could  be  made  out <br/>of  a  man,  but  the  foolish  would  regard  this  as  an  impossibility,  not  realizing  that  a  man  is  a  seed  from <br/>which  a  universe  may  be  brought  forth. <br/><br/>God  is  the  &quot;within&quot;  and  the  &quot;without&quot;  of  all  things.  The  Supreme  One  manifests  Himself  through <br/>growth,  which  is  an  urge  from  within  outward,  a  struggle  for  expression  and  manifestation.  There  is <br/>no  greater  miracle  in  the  growing  and  multiplication  of  gold  by  the  alchemist  than  in  a  tiny  mustard <br/>seed  producing  a  bush  many  thousands  of  times  the  size  of  the  seed.  If  a  mustard  seed  produces  a <br/>hundred  thousand  times  its  own  size  and  weight  when  planted  in  an  entirely  different  substance  (the <br/>earth),  why  should  not  the  seed  of  gold  be  multiplied  a  hundred  thousand  times  by  art  when  that  seed <br/>is  planted  in  its  earth  (the  base  metals)  and  nourished  artificially  by  the  secret  process  of  alchemy? <br/><br/>Alchemy  teaches  that  God  is  in  everything;  that  He  is  One  Universal  Spirit,  manifesting  through  an <br/>infinity  of  forms.  God,  therefore,  is  the  spiritual  seed  planted  in  the  dark  earth  (the  material  universe). <br/>By  arc  it  is  possible  so  to  grow  and  expand  this  seed  that  the  entire  universe  of  substance  is  tinctured <br/>thereby  and  becomes  like  unto  the  seed&#x2014;pure  gold.  In  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  this  is  termed <br/>regeneration;  in  the  material  body  of  the  elements  it  is  called  transmutation.  As  it  is  in  the  spiritual <br/>and  material  universes,  so  it  is  in  the  intellectual  world.  Wisdom  cannot  be  imparted  to  an  idiot <br/>because  the  seed  of  wisdom  is  not  within  him,  but  wisdom  may  be  imparted  to  an  ignorant  person, <br/>however  ignorant  he  may  be,  because  the  seed  of  wisdom  exists  in  him  and  can  be  developed  by  art <br/>and  culture.  Hence  a  philosopher  is  only  an  ignorant  man  within  whose  nature  a  projection  has  taken <br/>place. <br/><br/>Through  art  (the  process  of  learning)  the  whole  mass  of  base  metals  (the  mental  body  of  ignorance) <br/>was  transmuted  into  pure  gold  (wisdom),  for  it  was  tinctured  ynth  understanding.  If,  then,  through <br/>faith  and  proximity  to  God  the  consciousness  of  man  may  be  transmuted  from  base  animal  desires <br/>(represented  by  the  masses  of  the  planetary  metals)  into  a  pure,  golden,  and  godly  consciousness, <br/>illumined  and  redeemed,  and  the  manifesting  God  within  that  one  increased  from  a  tiny  spark  to  a <br/>great  and  glorious  Being;  if  also  the  base  metals  of  mental  ignorance  can,  through  proper  endeavor <br/>and  training,  be  transmuted  into  transcendent  genius  and  wisdom,  why  is  the  process  in  two  worlds <br/>or  spheres  of  application  not  equally  true  in  the  third?  If  both  the  spiritual  and  mental  elements  of  the <br/>universe  can  be  multiplied  in  their  expression,  then  by  the  law  of  analogy  the  material  elements  of  the <br/>universe  can  also  be  multiplied,  if  the  necessary  process  can  be  ascertained. <br/><br/>That  which  is  true  in  the  superior  is  true  in  the  inferior.  If  alchemy  be  a  great  spiritual  fact,  then  it  is <br/>also  a  great  material  fact.  If  it  can  take  place  in  the  universe,  it  can  take  place  in  man;  if  it  can  take <br/>place  in  man,  it  can  take  place  in  the  plants  and  minerals.  If  one  thing  in  the  universe  grows,  then <br/>everything  in  the  universe  grows.  If  one  thing  can  be  multiplied,  then  all  things  can  be  multiplied,  &quot;for <br/>the  superior  agrees  with  the  inferior  and  the  inferior  agrees  with  the  superior.&quot;  But  as  the  way  for  the <br/>redemption  of  the  soul  is  concealed  by  the  Mysteries,  so  the  secrets  for  the  redemption  of  the  metals <br/>are  also  concealed,  that  they  may  not  fall  into  the  hands  of  the  profane  and  thereby  become  perverted. <br/><br/>If  any  would  grow  metals,  he  must  first  learn  the  secrets  of  the  metals:  he  must  realize  that  all  metals- <br/>-like  all  stones,  plants,  animals,  and  universes&#x2014;grow  from  seeds,  and  that  these  seeds  are  already  in <br/>the  body  of  Substance  (the  womb  of  the  World  Virgin);  for  the  seed  of  man  is  in  the  universe  before <br/>he  is  born  (or  grows),  and  as  the  seed  of  the  plant  exists  for  all  time  though  the  plant  live  but  a  part  of <br/>that  time,  so  the  seeds  of  spiritual  gold  and  material  gold  are  ever  present  in  all  things.  The  metals <br/>grow  throughout  the  ages,  because  life  is  imparted  to  them  from  the  sun.  They  grow  imperceptibly,  in <br/><br/><br/>form  like  tiny  shrubs,  for  ever5rthing  grows  in  some  way.  Only  the  methods  of  growth  differ,  according <br/>to  kind  and  magnitude. <br/><br/>One  of  the  great  axioms  is,  &quot;Within  everything  is  the  seed  of  everything,&quot;  although  by  the  simple <br/>processes  of  Nature  it  may  remain  latent  for  many  centuries,  or  its  growth  may  be  exceedingly  slow. <br/>Therefore,  every  grain  of  sand  contains  not  only  the  seed  of  the  precious  metals  as  well  as  the  seed  of <br/>the  priceless  gems,  but  also  the  seeds  of  sun,  moon,  and  stars.  As  within  the  nature  of  man  is  reflected <br/>the  entire  universe  in  miniature,  so  in  each  grain  of  sand,  each  drop  of  water,  each  tiny  particle  of <br/>cosmic  dust,  are  concealed  all  the  parts  and  elements  of  cosmos  in  the  form  of  tiny  seed  germs  so <br/>minute  that  even  the  most  powerful  microscope  cannot  detect  them.  Trillions  of  times  smaller  than <br/>the  ion  or  electron,  these  seeds&#x2014;unrecognizable  and  incomprehensible&#x2014;await  the  time  assigned  them <br/>for  growth  and  expression.  (Consider  the  monads  of  Leibnitz.) <br/><br/>There  are  two  methods  whereby  growth  may  be  accomplished.  The  first  is  by  Nature,  for  Nature  is  an <br/>alchemist  forever  achieving  the  apparently  impossible.  The  second  is  by  art,  and  through  art  is <br/>produced  in  a  comparatively  short  time  that  which  requires  Nature  almost  endless  periods  to <br/>duplicate.  The  true  philosopher,  desiring  to  accomplish  the  Magnum  Opus,  patterns  his  conduct <br/>according  to  the  laws  of  Nature,  recognizing  that  the  art  of  alchemy  is  merely  a  method  copied  from <br/>Nature  but  with  the  aid  of  certain  secret  formulse  greatly  shortened  by  being  correspondingly <br/>intensified.  Nature,  in  order  to  achieve  her  miracles,  must  work  through  either  extensiveness;  or <br/>intensiveness.  The  extensive  processes  of  Nature  are  such  as  are  used  in  the  transmutation  of  the <br/>pitch  of  black  carbon  into  diamonds,  requiring  millions  of  years  of  natural  hardening.  The  intensive <br/>process  is  art,  which  is  ever  the  faithful  servant  of  Nature  (as  Dr.  A.  Dee  says),  supplementing  her <br/>every  step  and  cooperating  with  her  in  all  her  ways.  &quot;So,  in  this  philosophical  work.  Nature  and  Art <br/>ought  so  lovingly  to  embrace  each  other,  as  that  Arf  may  not  require  what  Nature  denies,  nor  Nature <br/>deny  what  may  be  perfected  by  Art.  For  Nature  assenting,  she  demeans  herself  obediently  to  every <br/>artist,  whilst  by  their  industry  she  is  helped,  not  hindered. &quot;  (Dr.  A.  Dee  in  his  Chemical  Collections.) <br/><br/>By  means  of  this  art  the  seed  which  is  within  the  soul  of  a  stone  may  be  made  to  germinate  so <br/>intensively  that  in  a  few  moments  a  diamond  is  grown  from  the  seed  of  itself.  If  the  seed  of  the <br/>diamond  were  not  in  the  marble,  granite,  and  sand,  a  diamond  could  not  be  grown  therefrom.  But  as <br/>the  seed  is  within  all  these  things,  a  diamond  may  be  grown  out  of  any  other  substance  in  the  universe. <br/>In  some  substances,  however,  it  is  easier  to  perform  this  miracle  because  in  them  these  germs  have <br/>already  been  long  fertilized  and  are  thus  more  nearly  prepared  for  the  vivifying  process  of  the  art. <br/>Likewise,  to  teach  some  men  wisdom  is  easier  than  to  teach  others,  for  some  already  have  a <br/>foundation  upon  which  to  work,  while  in  others  the  thinking  faculties  are  entirely  dormant.  Alchemy, <br/>therefore,  should  be  regarded  as  the  art  of  increasing  and  bringing  into  perfect  flower  with  the <br/>greatest  possible  expedition.  Nature  may  accomplish  her  desired  end  or,  because  of  the <br/>destructiveness  exercised  by  one  element  over  another,  she  may  not;  but  with  the  aid  of  the  true  art. <br/>Nature  always  accomplishes  her  end,  for  this  art  is  not  subject  either  to  the  wastings  of  time  or  to  the <br/>vandalism  of  elemental  reactions. <br/><br/>In  his  History  of  Chemistry,  James  Campbell  Brown,  late  professor  of  chemistry  in  the  University  of <br/>Liverpool,  sums  up  the  ends  which  alchemists  sought  to  achieve,  in  the  following  paragraphs: <br/><br/>&quot;This,  therefore,  was  the  general  aim  of  the  alchemists&#x2014; to  carry  out  in  the  laboratory,  as  far  as <br/>possible,  the  processes  which  Nature  carried  out  in  the  interior  of  the  earth.  Seven  leading  problems <br/>occupied  their  attention:&#x2014; <br/><br/>&quot;i.  The  preparation  of  a  compound  named  elixir,  magisterium  medicine,  or  philosopher's  stone, <br/>which  possessed  the  property  of  transmuting  the  baser  metals  into  gold  and  silver,  and  of  performing <br/>many  other  marvelous  operations.  *  *  * <br/><br/><br/>P155 <br/><br/><br/>&quot;2.  The  creation  of  homunculi,  or  living,  beings,  of  which  many  wonderful  but  incredible  tales  are  told. <br/><br/>&quot;3.  The  preparation  of  the  alcahest  or  universal  solvent,  which  dissolved  every  substance  which  was <br/>immersed  in  it.  *  *  * <br/><br/>&quot;4.  Palingenesis,  or  the  restoration  of  a  plant  from  its  ashes.  Had  they  succeeded  in  this,  they  would <br/>have  hoped  to  be  able  to  raise  the  dead.  [Professor  Brovm  takes  a  great  deal  for  granted.] <br/><br/>&quot;5.  The  preparation  of  spiritus  mundi,  a  mystic  substance  possessing  many  powers,  the  principal  of <br/>which  was  its  capacity  of  dissolving  gold. <br/><br/>&quot;6.  The  extraction  of  the  quintessence  or  active  principle  of  all  substances. <br/><br/>&quot;7.  The  preparation  of  aurum  potabile,  liquid  gold,  a  sovereign  remedy,  because  gold  being  itself <br/>perfect  could  produce  perfection  in  the  human  frame.&quot; <br/><br/>ALCHEMICAL  SYMBOLISM <br/><br/>In  alchemy  there  are  three  symbolic  substances:  mercury,  sulphur,  and  salt.  To  these  was  added  a <br/>fourth  mysterious  life  principle  called  Azoth.  Concerning  the  first  three,  Herr  von  Welling  has  written: <br/>&quot;There  are  three  basic  chemical  substances  which  are  called  by  the  philosophers  salt,  sulphur,  and <br/>mercury,  but  which  are  not  to  be  confounded  in  any  way  with  the  crude  salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury <br/>taken  from  the  earth  or  secured  from  the  apothecary.  Salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury  each  has  a  triune <br/>nature,  for  each  of  these  substances  contains,  in  reality,  also  the  other  two  substances,  according  to <br/>the  secret  arcanum  of  the  wise.  The  body  of  salt  is,  therefore,  threefold,  namely  salt,  sulphur,  and <br/>mercury;  but  in  the  body  of  salt  one  of  the  three  (salt)  predominates.  Mercury  is  likewise  composed  of <br/>salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury  with  the  latter  element  predominating.  Sulphur,  similarly,  is  actually  salt, <br/>sulphur,  and  mercury,  with  sulphur  predominating.  These  nine  divisions~3  times  3,  plus  Azoth  (the <br/>mysterious  universal  life  force),  equals  10,  the  sacred  decad  of  Pythagoras.  Concerning  the  nature  of <br/>Azoth  there  is  much  controversy.  Some  view  it  as  the  invisible,  eternal  fire;  others  as  electricity;  still <br/>others  as  magnetism.  Transcendentalism  refer  to  it  as  the  astral  light. <br/><br/>&quot;The  universe  is  surrounded  by  the  sphere  of  the  stars.  Beyond  that  sphere  is  the  sphere  of <br/>Schamayim,  which  is  the  Divine  fiery  water,  the  first  outflow  of  the  Word  of  God,  the  flaming  river <br/>pouring  from  the  presence  of  the  Eternal.  Schamayim,  the  fiery  androgynous  water,  divides.  The  fire <br/>becomes  the  solar  fire  and  the  water  becomes  the  lunar  water.  Schamayim  is  the  universal  mercury&#x2014; <br/>sometimes  called  Azofh&#x2014; the  measureless  spirit  of  life.  The  spiritual  fiery  original  water&#x2014; Schamayim- <br/>-comes  through  Eden  (in  Hebrew,  vapor)  and  pours  itself  into  four  main  rivers  [the  elements].  This  is <br/>the  river  of  living  water~Azof/i  [the  fiery  mercurial  essence]  that  flows  out  from  the  throne  of  God <br/>and  the  Lamb.  In  this  Eden  [vaporous  essence  or  mist]  is  the  spiritual  earth  [incomprehensible  and <br/>intangible],  or  the  dust  Aphar,  out  of  which  God  formed  Adam  min  Haadamah,  the  spiritual  body  of <br/>man,  which  body  must  sometime  become  revealed.&quot; <br/><br/>In  another  part  of  his  writings  von  Welling  also  says  that  there  was  no  material  universe  until  Lucifer, <br/>attempting  to  perform  the  cosmic  alchemy,  misused  the  Schamayim,  or  the  Divine  Fire.  In  order  to <br/>reestablish  the  Schamayim  which  Lucifer  had  perverted,  this  universe  was  formed  as  a  means  of <br/>liberating  it  from  the  dark  cloud  within  which  it  was  locked  by  the  failure  of  Lucifer's  attempt  to <br/>control  it.  These  statements  clearly  emphasize  the  fact  that  the  early  philosophers  recognized  in  the <br/>Bible  a  book  of  chemical  and  alchemical  formulae.  It  is  essential  that  this  point  be  kept  in  mind  at  all <br/>times.  Woe  to  that  seeker  who  accepts  as  literal  the  rambling  allegories  of  the  alchemists.  Such  a  one <br/>can  never  enter  the  inner  sanctuary  of  truth.  Elias  Ashmole  in  his  Theatrum  Chemicum  Britannicum <br/><br/><br/>thus  describes  the  methods  employed  by  the  alchemists  to  conceal  their  true  doctrines:  &quot;Their <br/><br/>chiefest  study  was  to  wrap  up  their  Secrets  in  Fables,  and  spin  out  their  Fancies  in  Vailes  and <br/>shadows,  whose  Radii  seems  to  extend  every  way,  yet  so,  that  they  meet  in  a  Common  Center,  and <br/>point  onely  at  One  thing.&quot; <br/><br/>The  fact  that  the  Scriptures  reveal  a  hidden  knowledge,  if  considered  allegorically,  is  clearly <br/>demonstrated  by  a  parable  describing  King  Solomon,  his  wives,  concubines,  and  virgins,  which <br/>parable  occurs  in  Geheime  Figuren  der  Rosenkreuzer,  published  in  Ultona  in  1785.  Dr.  Hartmann, <br/>who  translated  part  of  this  work  into  English,  declared  that  the  wives  of  Solomon  represented  the  arts, <br/>the  concubines  the  sciences,  and  the  virgins  the  still  unrevealed  secrets  of  Nature.  By  order  of  the <br/>King  the  virgins  were  forced  to  remove  their  veils,  thus  signifying  that  by  means  of  wisdom  (Solomon) <br/>the  mystic  arts  were  forced  to  disclose  their  hidden  parts  to  the  philosopher,  while  to  the  uninitiated <br/>world  only  the  outside  garments  were  visible.  (Such  is  the  mystery  of  the  veil  of  Isis.) <br/><br/>As  the  alchemist  must  do  his  work  in  four  worlds  simultaneously  if  he  would  achieve  the  Magnum <br/>Opus,  a  table  showing  the  analogies  of  the  three  principles  in  the  four  worlds  may  clarify  the <br/>relationship  which  the  various  parts  bear  to  each  other.  The  early  masters  of  the  art  of  alchemical <br/>symbolism  did  not  standardize  either  their  symbols  or  their  terms.  Thus  it  required  great  familiarity <br/>with  the  subject  combined  with  considerable  intuitive  power  to  unravel  some  of  their  enigmatical <br/>statements.  The  third  and  fourth  divisions  of  the  following  table  are  given  alternative  renderings, <br/>owing  to  the  fact  that  some  authors  did  not  draw  a  clear  line  between  spirit  and  soul.  According  to  the <br/>Scriptures,  spirit  is  indestructible,  but  soul  is  destructible.  Obviously,  then,  they  are  not  synonymous. <br/>It  is  clearly  stated  that  &quot;the  soul  that  sinneth,  it  shall  die,&quot;  but  &quot;the  spirit  shall  return  unto  God  who <br/>gave  it.&quot;  The  table  of  analogies,  as  nearly  as  they  can  be  established,  is  as  follows: <br/><br/><br/>The  Triune  Power  in  Four  Worlds <br/><br/><br/>WORLD  OF <br/><br/>1.

Man <br/><br/>3.  Elements <br/><br/>4.  Chemicals <br/><br/><br/>Father <br/>Spirit <br/>Air <br/><br/>Sulphur <br/><br/><br/>Son <br/>Soul <br/>Water <br/>Mercury <br/><br/><br/>Mother <br/>Body <br/>Earth <br/>Salt <br/><br/><br/>The  main  point,  however,  is  proved:  the  alchemical  philosophers  used  the  symbols  of  salt,  sulphur, <br/>and  mercury  to  represent  not  only  chemicals  but  the  spiritual  and  invisible  principles  of  God,  man, <br/>and  the  universe.  The  three  substances  (salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury)  existing  in  four  worlds,  as  shown <br/><br/><br/>in  the  table,  sum  up  to  the  sacred  number  12.  As  these  12  are  the  foundations  of  the  Great  Work,  they <br/>are  called  in  Revelation  the  twelve  foundation  stones  of  the  sacred  city.  In  line  with  the  same  idea <br/>Pythagoras  asserted  that  the  dodecahedron,  or  twelve-faced  symmetrical  geometric  solid,  was  the <br/>foundation  of  the  universe.  May  there  not  be  a  relation  also  between  this  mysterious  3  times  4  and  the <br/>four  parties  of  three  which  in  the  legend  of  the  third  degree  of  Freemasonry  go  forth  to  the  four  angles <br/>of  the  cherubim,  the  composite  creature  of  four  parts? <br/><br/><br/>A  nftu- <br/><br/>Bptwc&#x2014;  <br/><br/> . <br/><br/>Caic,^  : <br/><br/>{jova.  <br/><br/>CiHit  <br/><br/>ir&lt;K  <br/><br/>IB <br/><br/>B,hfi  <br/><br/>TiillMtiLaiou <br/><br/>ill? <br/><br/>+^ <br/><br/>sis  DC <br/><br/>^  i <br/><br/>StiVO  <br/><br/>Sfii^'^&#x2014; <br/><br/>*^  / <br/><br/>&#x00a5;^ <br/><br/>lEa  &#x2014; <br/><br/>IS.*  <br/><br/>.Aunffi  ^ <br/><br/>AiJUA  ^. <br/><br/>Tkunt.  <br/><br/>E-Cel*  <br/><br/>a; <br/><br/>J[i]1hS,  <br/><br/>^&#x00ae; <br/><br/>'  l,lt^i*f^ &#x2014; <br/><br/>-Tk. <br/><br/>JiM^-  J, <br/><br/>if <br/><br/>&#x25a0;rl  &#x25a0;  ' <br/><br/>A  TABLE  OF  MEDLEVAL  ALCHEMICAL  SYMBOLS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Valentine's  The  Last  Will  and  Testament. <br/><br/>Hermetists  used  the  curious  symbols  shown  in  this  rare  table  to  represent  various  chemical  elements  and  alchemical <br/>processes.  The  full  meaning  of  these  strange  characters  has  never  been  revealed,  the  characters  concealing  effectually <br/>within  their  own  forms  the  occult  secrets  regarding  the  spiritual  nature  of  the  metals  and  elements  which  they  represent. <br/><br/>In  their  allegories  the  alchemists  also  wed  human,  animal,  and  plant  emblems;  sometimes  weird  composite  figures,  such <br/>as  the  dragon,  the  winged  serpent,  the  unicorn,  and  the  phoenix.  In  almost  every  case  they  symbolized  gold  as  a  king  with <br/>a  crown  on  his  head  and  often  with  a  scepter  in  his  hand.  Sometimes  they  depicted  him  with  the  ace  of  the  solar  disc <br/><br/><br/>surrounded  by  rays.  Silver  was  personified  as  a  woman  who  they  called  the  queen.  She  wore  no  crown  but  often  stood <br/>upon  a  lunar  crescent:  much  after  the  fashion  of  the  Madonna.  Mercury  was  typified  as  a  youth  with  wings,  often  with  two <br/>heads,  carrying  serpents  or  sometimes  the  caduceus.  Lead  they  symbolized  by  an  old  man  with  a  sc)i:he  in  his  hand;  iron <br/>by  a  soldier  dressed  in  armor.  To  aquafortis  was  given  the  curious  name  &quot;the  ostrich's  stomach,&quot;  and  to  the  attainment  of <br/>the  &quot;Great  Work&quot;  they  assigned  the  symbol  of  the  phoenix  sitting  upon  a  nest  of  fire.  The  union  of  elements  they <br/>symbolized  by  a  marriage,  the  Process  of  putrefaction  by  a  skull,  antimony  by  a  dragon. <br/><br/><br/>p.  156 <br/><br/><br/>The  following  table  shows  the  angles  to  which  the  parties  of  three  (salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury)  go  in <br/>search  of  CHiram: <br/><br/><br/>The  Four  &quot;Comers &quot;  of  Creation <br/><br/>The  Fixed  Signs  of  the  Zodiac <br/><br/>The  Parts  of  the  Cherubim <br/><br/>The  Four  Seasons <br/><br/>The  Ages  of  Man <br/><br/>The  Stages  of  Existence <br/><br/>The  Parts  of  Man's <br/>Constitution <br/><br/>The  Four  Elements <br/><br/><br/>East <br/><br/>South <br/><br/>Aquarius <br/><br/>Leo <br/><br/>Man <br/><br/>Lion <br/><br/>Spring <br/><br/>Summer <br/><br/>Childhood <br/><br/>Youth <br/><br/>Birth <br/><br/>Growth <br/><br/>Spirit <br/><br/>Soul <br/><br/>Air <br/><br/>Fire <br/><br/>West <br/><br/>North <br/><br/>Scorpio <br/><br/>Taurus <br/><br/>Eagle <br/><br/>Bull <br/><br/>Autumn <br/><br/>Winter <br/><br/>Maturity <br/><br/>Age <br/><br/>Maturity <br/><br/>Decay <br/><br/>Mind <br/><br/>Body <br/><br/>Water <br/><br/>Earth <br/><br/>One  more  table  should  prove  of  interest  to  Masonic  scholars:  one  showing  the  relationship  existing <br/>between  the  three  substances,  salt,  sulphur,  and  mercury,  and  certain  symbols  with  which  Masons  are <br/>familiar.

The  Three  Grand  Masters  Solomon <br/><br/><br/>Hiram <br/><br/><br/>Hiram  of  Tyre <br/><br/><br/>In  alchemy  is  found  again  the  perpetuation  of  the  Universal  Mystery;  for  as  surely  as  Jesus  died  upon <br/>the  cross,  Hiram  ^CHiram)  at  the  west  gate  of  the  Temple,  Orpheus  on  the  banks  of  the  river  Hebros, <br/>Christna  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges,  and  Osiris  in  the  coffin  prepared  by  Typhon,  so  in  alchemy, <br/>unless  the  elements  first  die,  the  Great  Work  cannot  be  achieved.  The  stages  of  the  alchemical <br/>processes  can  be  traced  in  the  lives  and  activities  of  nearly  all  the  world  Saviors  and  teachers,  and  also <br/>among  the  mythologies  of  several  nations.  It  is  said  in  the  Bible  that  &quot;except  a  man  be  born  again,  he <br/>cannot  see  the  kingdom  of  God.&quot;  In  alchemy  it  is  declared  that  without  putrefaction  the  Great  Work <br/>cannot  be  accomplished.  What  is  it  that  dies  on  the  cross,  is  buried  in  the  tomb  of  the  Mysteries,  and <br/>that  dies  also  in  the  retort  and  becomes  black  with  putrefaction?  Also,  what  is  it  that  does  this  same <br/>thing  in  the  nature  of  man,  that  he  may  rise  again,  phoenix-like,  from  his  own  ashes  {caput  mortuum)? <br/><br/><br/>The  solution  in  the  alchemical  retort,  if  digested  a  certain  length  of  time,  will  turn  into  a  red  elixir, <br/>which  is  called  the  universal  medicine.  It  resembles  a  fiery  water  and  is  luminous  in  the  dark.  During <br/>the  process  of  digestion  it  passes  through  many  colors  which  has  given  rise  to  its  being  called  the <br/>peacock  because  of  its  iridescence  during  one  of  the  periods  of  its  digestion.  If  the  augmentations  of <br/><br/><br/>its  power  be  carried  too  far,  the  test  tube  containing  the  substance  will  explode  and  vanish  as  dust. <br/>This  commonly  occurs  and  is  the  greatest  danger  involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  medicine  for  men <br/>and  metals.  If  developed  too  far,  it  will  also  seep  through  the  glass,  for  there  is  no  physical  container <br/>sufficiently  strong  to  hold  it.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  it  is  no  longer  a  substance  but  a  divine  essence <br/>partaking  of  the  interpenetrative  power  of  Divinity.  When  it  is  properly  developed,  this  universal <br/>solvent  in  liquid  form  will  dissolve  into  itself  all  other  metals.  In  this  high  state  the  universal  salt  is  a <br/>liquid  fire.  This  salt  dissolved  with  the  proper  amount  of  any  metal  and  run  through  the  different <br/>stages  of  digestion  and  rotations;  of  augmentations  will  eventually  become  a  medicine  for  the <br/>transmuting  of  inferior  metals. <br/><br/>The  True  Way  of  Nature  by  Hermes  Trismegistus,  given  out  by  a  genuine  Freemason,  I.C.H., <br/>describes  the  danger  of  over-augmenting  the  universal  salt:  &quot;But  this  multiplication  cannot  be  carried <br/>on  ad  infinitum  but  it  attains  completeness  in  the  ninth  rotation.  For  when  this  tincture  has  been <br/>rotated  nine  times  it  cannot  be  exalted  any  further  because  it  will  not  permit  any  further  separation. <br/>For  as  soon  as  it  perceives  only  the  smallest  degree  of  material  fire  it  goes  instantly  into  a  flux  and <br/>passes  through  the  glass  like  hot  oil  through  paper.&quot; <br/><br/>In  classifying  the  processes  through  which  the  chemical  elements  must  pass  before  the  Hermetic <br/>medicine  is  produced,  lack  of  uniformity  in  terminology  is  evidenced,  for  in  The  True  Way  of  Nature <br/>seven  stages  are  given,  while  in  the  Dictionnaire  Mytho-Hermetique  twelve  are  noted.  These  twelve <br/>are  linked  with  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  in  a  manner  worthy  of  consideration. <br/><br/>1.  Aries,  Calcination <br/><br/>2.  Taurus,  Congelation <br/><br/>3.  Gemini,  Fixation <br/><br/>4.  Cancer,  Dissolution <br/><br/>This  arrangement  opens  an  interesting  field  of  speculation  which  may  be  of  great  service  if <br/>intelligently  carried  out.  These  twelve  &quot;steps&quot;  leading  up  to  the  accomplishment  of  the  Magnum  Opus <br/>are  a  reminder  of  the  twelve  degrees  of  the  ancient  Rosicrucian  Mysteries.  To  a  certain  degree, <br/>Rosicrucianism  was  chemistry  theologized  and  alchemy  philosophized.  According  to  the  Mysteries, <br/>man  was  redeemed  as  the  result  of  his  passage  in  rotation  through  the  twelve  mansions  of  the <br/>heavens.  The  twelve  processes  by  means  of  which  the  &quot;secret  essence&quot;  may  be  discovered  remind  the <br/>student  forcibly  of  the  twelve  Fellow  Craftsmen  who  are  sent  forth  in  search  of  the  murdered  Builder <br/>of  the  Universe,  the  Universal  Mercury. <br/><br/>According  to  Solomon  Trismosin,  the  stages  through  which  matter  passes  in  its  journey  towards <br/>perfection  are  divided  into  twenty-two  parts,  each  of  which  is  represented  by  an  appropriate  drawing. <br/>There  is  an  important  connection  between  the  twenty-two  emblems  of  Trismosin,  the  twenty-two <br/>major  cards  of  the  Tarot,  and  the  twenty-two  letters  of  the  Hebrew  alphabet.  These  mysterious  Tarot <br/>cards  are  themselves  an  alchemical  formula,  if  properly  interpreted.  As  if  to  substantiate  the  claims  of <br/>mediaeval  philosophers  that  King  Solomon  was  a  master  of  alchemy.  Dr.  Franz  Hartmann  has  noted <br/>that  the  much-abused  and  misunderstood  Song  of  Solomon  is  in  reality  an  alchemical  formula.  The <br/>student  of  natural  philosophy  will  immediately  recognize  the  &quot;dark  maid  of  Jerusalem,&quot;  not  as  a <br/>person  but  as  a  material  sacred  to  the  sages.  Dr.  Hartmann  writes:  &quot;The  'Song  of  Solomon,'  in  the  Old <br/>Testament,  is  a  description  of  the  processes  of  Alchemy.  In  this  Song  the  Subjectum  is  described  in <br/>Cant,  i.,  5;  the  Lilium  artis  in  C.  n.,  1;  the  Preparation  and  Purification  in  C.  ii.,  4;  the  Fire  in  C.  n'.,  7, <br/>and  C.  iv.,  16,  the  Putrefaction  in  C.

A  miniature  universe  is  formed  which  the  philosophers <br/>have  affirmed  actually  rises  out  of  the  water  and  floats  in  the  air,  where  it  passes  through  all  the <br/>stages  of  cosmic  unfoldment  and  finally  disintegrates  into  dust  again.  Not  only  is  it  possible  to <br/>prepare  a  medicine  for  metals;  it  is  also  possible  to  prepare  a  tincture  for  minerals  by  means  of  which <br/>pieces  of  granite  and  marble  can  be  turned  into  precious  stones;  also  stones  of  inferior  quality  may  be <br/>improved. <br/><br/>As  one  of  the  great  alchemists  fittingly  observed,  man's  quest  for  gold  is  often  his  undoing,  for  he <br/>mistakes  the  alchemical  processes,  believing  them  to  be  purely  material.  He  does  not  realize  that  the <br/>Philosopher's  Gold,  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  and  the  Philosopher's  Medicine  exist  in  each  of  the  four <br/>worlds  and  that  the  consummation  of  the  experiment  cannot  be  realized  until  it  is  successfully  carried <br/>on  in  four  worlds  simultaneously  according  to  one  formula.  Furthermore,  one  of  the  constituents  of <br/>the  alchemical  formula  exists  only  within  the  nature  of  man  himself,  without  which  his  chemicals  will <br/>not  combine,  and  though  he  spend  his  life  and  fortune  in  chemical  experimentation,  he  will  not <br/>produce  the  desired  end.  The  paramount  reason  why  the  material  scientist  is  incapable  of  duplicating <br/>the  achievements  of  the  mediaeval  alchemists&#x2014;although  he  follow  every  step  carefully  and  accurately- <br/>-is  that  the  subtle  element  which  comes  out  of  the  nature  of  the  illuminated  and  regenerated <br/>alchemical  philosopher  is  missing  in  his  experimentation. <br/><br/>On  this  subject  Dr.  Franz  Hartmann  in  a  footnote  to  his  translation  of  extracts  from  Paracelsus <br/>clearly  expresses  the  conclusions  of  a  modern  investigator  of  alchemical  lore:  &quot;I  wish  to  warn  the <br/>reader,  who  might  be  inclined  to  try  any  of  the  alchemical  prescriptions  *  *  *,  not  to  do  so  unless  he  is <br/>an  alchemist,  because,  although  I  know  from  personal  experience  that  these  prescriptions  are  not <br/>only  allegorically  but  literally  true,  and  will  prove  successful  in  the  hands  of  an  alchemist,  they  would <br/>only  cause  a  waste  of  time  and  money  in  the  hands  of  one  who  has  not  the  necessary  qualifications.  A <br/>person  who  wants  to  be  an  alchemist  must  have  in  himself  the  'magnesia',  which  means,  the  magnetic <br/>power  to  attract  and  'coagulate'  invisible  astral  elements.&quot; <br/><br/>In  considering  the  formulae  on  the  following  pages,  it  must  be  recognized  that  the  experiments  cannot <br/>be  successfully  conducted  unless  the  one  who  performs  them  be  himself  a  Magus.  If  two  persons,  one <br/>an  initiate  and  the  other  unilluminated  in  the  supreme  art,  were  to  set  to  work,  side  by  side,  using  the <br/>same  vessels,  the  same  substances,  and  exactly  the  same  modus  operandi,  the  initiate  would  produce <br/>his  &quot;gold&quot;  and  the  uninitiated  would  not.  Unless  the  greater  alchemy  has  first  taken  place  within  the <br/>soul  of  man,  he  cannot  perform  the  lesser  alchemy  in  the  retort.  This  is  an  invariable  rule,  although  it <br/>is  cunningly  hidden  in  the  allegories  and  emblems  of  Hermetic  philosophy.  Unless  a  man  be  &quot;born <br/>again&quot;  he  cannot  accomplish  the  Great  Work,  and  if  the  student  of  alchemical  formulae  will  remember <br/>this,  it  will  save  him  much  sorrow  and  disappointment.  To  speak  of  that  part  of  the  mystery  which  is <br/>concerned  with  the  secret  life  principle  within  the  actual  nature  of  man,  is  forbidden,  for  it  is  decreed <br/>by  the  Masters  of  the  art  that  each  shall  discover  that  for  himself  and  on  this  subject  it  is  unlawful  to <br/>speak  at  greater  length. <br/><br/><br/>p-157 <br/><br/><br/>The  Theory  and  Practice  of  Alchemy <br/><br/>Part  Two <br/><br/>All  true  Philosophers  of  the  natural  or  Hermetic  sciences  begin  their  labors  with  a  prayer  to  the <br/>Supreme  Alchemist  of  the  Universe,  beseeching  His  assistance  in  the  consummation  of  the  Magnum <br/>Opus.  The  prayer  that  follows,  written  in  a  provincial  German  centuries  ago  by  an  adept  now <br/>unknown,  is  representative:  &quot;O  holy  and  hallowed  Trinity,  Thou  undivided  and  triple  Unity!  Cause  me <br/>to  sink  into  the  abyss  of  Thy  limitless  eternal  Fire,  for  only  in  that  Fire  can  the  mortal  nature  of  man <br/>be  changed  into  humble  dust,  while  the  new  body  of  the  salt  union  lies  in  the  light.  Oh,  melt  me  and <br/>transmute  me  in  this  Thy  holy  Fire,  so  that  on  the  day  at  Thy  command  the  fiery  waters  of  the  Holy <br/>Spirit  draw  me  out  from  the  dark  dust,  giving  me  new  birth  and  making  me  alive  with  His  breath. <br/>May  I  also  be  exalted  through  the  humble  humility  of  Thy  Son,  rising  through  His  assistance  out  of <br/>the  dust  and  ashes  and  changing  into  a  pure  spiritual  body  of  rainbow  colors  like  unto  the  transparent, <br/>crystal-like,  paradisiacal  gold,  that  my  own  nature  may  be  redeemed  and  purified  like  the  elements <br/>before  me  in  these  glasses  and  bottles.  Diffuse  me  in  the  waters  of  life  as  though  I  were  in  the  wine <br/>cellar  of  the  eternal  Solomon.  Here  the  fire  of  Thy  love  will  receive  new  fuel  and  will  blaze  forth  so <br/>that  no  streams  can  extinguish  it.  Through  the  aid  of  this  divine  fire,  may  I  in  the  end  be  found  worthy <br/>to  be  called  into  the  illumination  of  the  righteous.  May  I  then  be  sealed  up  with  the  light  of  the  new <br/>world  that  I  may  also  attain  unto  the  immortality  and  glory  where  there  shall  be  no  more  alternation <br/>of  light  and  darkness.  Amen.&quot; <br/><br/>THE  ORIGIN  OF  ALCHEMICAL  FORMULA <br/><br/>Apparently  but  few  of  the  mediaeval  alchemists  discovered  the  Great  Arcanum  without  aid,  some <br/>authors  declaring  that  none  of  them  attained  the  desired  end  without  the  assistance  of  a  Master  or <br/>Teacher.  In  every  instance  the  identity  of  these  Masters  has  been  carefully  concealed,  and  even  during <br/>the  Middle  Ages  speculation  ran  rife  concerning  them.  It  was  customary  to  call  such  illuminated  sages <br/>adepts,  a  title  which  indicated  that  they  possessed  the  true  secrets  of  transmutation  and <br/>multiplication.  These  adepts  were  polyonymous  individuals  who  unexpectedly  appeared  and <br/>disappeared  again,  leaving  no  trace  of  their  whereabouts.  There  are  indications  that  a  certain  degree <br/>of  organization  existed  among  them.  The  most  powerful  of  the  alchemical  organizations  were  the <br/>Rosicrucians,  the  Illuminati,  and  certain  Arabian  and  Syrian  sects. <br/><br/>I  n  the  documents  which  follow,  references  are  made  to  the  &quot;Brethren  &quot;or  &quot;Brothers.  &quot;  These  are  to <br/>signify  that  those  who  had  actually  accomplished  the  Magnum  Opus  were  banded  together  and <br/>known  to  each  other  by  cipher  codes  and  secret  signs  or  symbols.  Apparently  a  number  of  these <br/>illuminated  adepts  dwelt  in  Arabia,  for  several  of  the  great  European  alchemists  were  initiated  in  Asia <br/>Minor.  When  a  disciple  of  the  alchemical  arts  had  learned  the  supreme  secret,  he  guarded  it  jealously, <br/>revealing  to  no  man  his  priceless  treasure.  He  was  not  permitted  to  disclose  it  even  to  the  members  of <br/>his  immediate  family. <br/><br/>As  the  years  passed,  one  who  had  discovered  the  secret&#x2014;or,  more  properly,  one  to  whom  it  had  been <br/>revealed&#x2014;sought  for  some  younger  man  worthy  to  be  entrusted  with  the  formulae.  To  this  one,  and  to <br/>this  one  only,  as  a  rule,  the  philosopher  was  permitted  to  disclose  the  arcanum.  The  younger  man <br/>then  became  the  &quot;philosophical  son&quot;  of  the  old  sage,  and  to  him  the  latter  bequeathed  his  secrets. <br/>Occasionally,  however,  an  adept,  on  finding  a  sincere  and  earnest  seeker,  would  instruct  him  in  the <br/>fundamental  principles  of  the  art,  and  if  the  disciple  persisted,  he  was  quietly  initiated  into  the  august <br/>fraternity  of  the  Brethren.  In  such  manner  the  alchemical  processes  were  preserved,  but  the  number <br/>of  those  who  knew  them  did  not  increase  rapidly. <br/><br/><br/>During  the  sixteenth,  seventeenth,  and  eighteenth  centuries  a  considerable  number  of  alchemical <br/><br/>adepts  made  their  way  from  place  to  place  throughout  Europe,  appearing  and  disappearing <br/>apparently  at  will.  According  to  popular  tradition,  these  adepts  were  immortal,  and  kept  themselves <br/>alive  by  means  of  the  mysterious  medicine  that  was  one  of  the  goals  of  alchemical  aspiration.  It  is <br/>asserted  that  some  lived  hundreds  of  years,  taking  no  food  except  this  elixir,  a  few  drops  of  which <br/>would  preserve  their  youth  for  a  long  period  of  time.  That  such  mysterious  men  did  exist  there  can  be <br/>little  doubt,  as  their  presence  is  attested  by  scores  of  reliable  witnesses. <br/><br/>It  is  further  asserted  that  they  are  still  to  be  found  by  those  who  have  qualified  themselves  to  contact <br/>them.  The  philosophers  taught  that  like  attracts  like,  and  that  when  the  disciple  has  developed  a <br/>virtue  and  integrity  acceptable  to  the  adepts  they  will  appear  to  him  and  reveal  those  parts  of  the <br/>secret  processes  which  cannot  be  discovered  without  such  help.  &quot;Wisdom  is  as  a  flower  from  which <br/>the  bee  its  honey  makes  and  the  spider  poison,  each  according  to  its  own  nature.&quot;  (By  an  unknown <br/>adept.) <br/><br/>The  reader  must  bear  in  mind  at  all  times  that  the  formulee  and  emblems  of  alchemy  are  to  be  taken <br/>primarily  as  allegorical  symbols;  for  until  their  esoteric  significance  has  been  comprehended,  their <br/>literal  interpretation  is  valueless.  Nearly  every  alchemical  formula  has  one  element  purposely  omitted, <br/>it  being  decided  by  the  mediaeval  philosophers  that  those  who  could  not  with  their  own  intelligence <br/>discover  that  missing  substance  or  process  were  not  qualified  to  be  entrusted  with  secrets  which  could <br/>give  them  control  over  great  masses  of  humanity  and  likewise  subject  to  their  will  the  elemental <br/>forces  of  Nature. <br/><br/>THE  EMERALD  TABLE  OF  HERMES <br/><br/>The  oldest  and  most  revered  of  all  the  alchemical  formulae  is  the  sacred  Emerald  Tablet  of  Hermes. <br/>Authorities  do  not  agree  as  to  the  genuineness  of  this  Table,  some  declaring  it  to  be  a  post-Christian <br/>fraud,  but  there  is  much  evidence  that,  regardless  of  its  author,  the  Table  is  of  great  antiquity.  While <br/>the  symbol  of  the  Emerald  Table  is  of  special  Masonic  import&#x2014;relating  as  it  does  to  the  personality  of <br/>CHiram  (Hiram)~it  is  first  and  fundamentally  an  alchemical  formula,  relating  both  to  the  alchemy  of <br/>the  base  metals  and  the  divine  alchemy  of  human  regeneration. <br/><br/>In  Dr.  Sigismund  Bacstrom's  collection  of  alchemical  manuscripts  is  a  section  devoted  to  the <br/>translations  and  interpretations  of  this  remarkable  Tablet,  which  was  known  to  the  ancients  as  the <br/>Tabula  Smaragdina.  Dr.  Bacstrom  was  initiated  into  the  Brotherhood  of  the  Rose  Cross  on  the  island <br/>of  Mauritius  by  one  of  those  unknown  adepts  who  at  that  time  called  himself  Comte  de  Chazal.  Dr. <br/>Bacstrom's  translations  and  notes  on  the  Emerald  Tablet  are,  in  part,  as  follows,  the  actual  text  being <br/>reproduced  in  capital  letters: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Emerald  Table,  the  Most  Ancient  Monument  of  the  Chaldeans  concerning  the  Lapis <br/>Philosophorum  (the  stone  of  the  philosophers). <br/><br/>&quot;The  Emerald  Table  furnishes  the  origin  of  the  allegorical  history  of  King  Hiram  (rather  Chiram).  The <br/><br/>Chaldeans,  Egyptians,  and  Hebrews  in  what  concerns  Chiram  have  taken  their  knowledge  from  one <br/>and  the  same  fountain;  Homerus,  who  relates  this  history  in  a  different  manner,  followed  that <br/>original,  and  Virgil  followed <br/><br/><br/>THE  KEY  TO  ALCHEMY  ACCORDING  TO  THE  EGYPTIANS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Kircher's  CEdipus^gyptiacus. <br/><br/>The  priests  of  Egypt  not  only  used  the  scarab  as  a  symbol  of  regeneration  but  also  discovered  in  its  habits  many  analogies <br/>to  the  secret  process  whereby  base  metals  could  be  transmuted  into  gold.  They  saw  in  the  egg  of  the  scarab  the  seed  of  the <br/>metals,  and  the  above  figure  shows  the  path  of  this  seed  through  the  various  planetary  bodies  until,  finally  reaching  the <br/>center,  it  is  perfected  and  then  returns  again  to  its  source.  The  words  in  the  mall  spiral  at  the  top  read:  &quot;The  spiral <br/>Progress  of  the  mundane  spirit.&quot;  After  the  scarab  has  wound  its  way  around  the  spiral  to  the  center  of  the  lower  part  of  the <br/>figure,  it  returns  to  the  upper  world  along  the  path  bearing  the  words:  &quot;Return  of  the  spirit  to  the  center  of  unity.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>p.  158 <br/><br/><br/>Homerus,  as  Hesiodus  took  the  subject  for  his  Theogony  hkewise  from  thence,  which  Ovidius  took <br/>afterwards  for  a  pattern  for  his  Metamorphosis.  The  knowledge  of  Nature's  secret  operations <br/>constitutes  the  principal  sense  of  all  these  ancient  writings,  but  ignorance  framed  out  of  it  that <br/>external  or  veiled  mjithology  and  the  lower  class  of  people  turned  it  into  idolatry. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Genuine  Translation  from  the  Original  Very  Ancient  Chaldee  is  as  Follows: <br/><br/>&quot;THE  SECRET  WORKS  OF  CHIRAM  ONE  IN  ESSENCE,  BUT  THREE  IN  ASPECT. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;(The  two  first  large  words  mean  the  Secret  Work.) <br/><br/><br/>&quot;(The  second  line  in  large  letters,  reads:  Chiram  Telat  Machasot,  i.e.  Chiram  the  Universal  Agent, <br/>One  in  Essence  but  three  in  aspect.) <br/><br/><br/>'IT  IS  TRUE,  NO  LIE,  CERTAIN,  AND  TO  BE  DEPENDED  UPON,  THE  SUPERIOR  AGREES  WITH <br/>THE  INFERIOR,  AND  THE  INFERIOR  WITH  THE  SUPERIOR,  TO  EFFECT  THAT  ONE  TRULY <br/>WONDERFUL  WORK.  AS  ALL  THINGS  OWE  THEIR  EXISTENCE  TO  THE  WILL  OF  THE  ONLY <br/>ONE,  SO  ALL  THINGS  OWE  THEIR  ORIGIN  TO  THE  ONE  ONLY  THING,  THE  MOST  HIDDEN,  BY <br/>THE  ARRANGEMENT  OF  THE  ONLY  GOD.  THE  FATHER  OF  THAT  ONE  ONLY  THING  IS  THE <br/>SUN,  ITS  MOTHER  IS  THE  MOON,  THE  WIND  CARRIES  IT  IN  ITS  BELLY;  BUT  ITS  NOURSE  ISA <br/>SPIRITUOUS  EARTH.  THAT  ONE  ONLY  THING  (after  God)  IS  THE  FATHER  OF  ALL  THINGS  IN <br/>THE  UNIVERSE.  ITS  POWER  IS  PERFECT,  AFTER  IT  HAS  BEEN  UNITED  TO  A  SPIRITUOUS <br/>EARTH. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;(Process-First  Distillation.)  SEPARATE  THAT  SPIRITUOUS  EARTH  FROM  THE  DENSE  OR <br/>CRUDE  BY  MEANS  OF  A  GENTLE  HEAT,  WITH  MUCH  ATTENTION. <br/><br/>&quot;(Last  Digestion.)  IN  GREAT  MEASURE  IT  ASCENDS  FROM  THE  EARTH  UP  TO  HEAVEN,  AND <br/>DESCENDS  AGAIN,  NEWBORN,  ON  THE  EARTH,  AND  THE  SUPERIOR  AND  THE  INFERIOR <br/>ARE  INCREASED  IN  POWER.  The  Azoth  ascends  from  the  Earth,  from  the  bottom  of  the  Glass,  and <br/>redescends  in  Veins  and  drops  into  the  Earth  and  by  this  continual  circulation  the  Azoth  is  more  and <br/>more  subtilized.  Volatilizes  Sol  and  carries  the  volatilized  Solar  atoms  along  with  it  and  thereby <br/>becomes  a  Solar  Azoth,  i.e.  our  third,  and  genuine  Sophie  Mercury,  and  this  circulation  of  the  Solar <br/>Azoth  must  continue  until  it  ceases  of  itself,  and  the  Earth  has  sucked  it  all  in,  when  it  muse  become <br/>the  black  pitchy  matter,  the  Toad  [the  substances  in  the  alchemical  retort  and  also  the  lower  elements <br/>in  the  body  of  man],  which  denotes  complete  putrefaction  or  Death  of  the  Compound. <br/><br/>&quot;BY  THIS  THOU  WILT  PARTAKE  OF  THE  HONOURS  OF  THE  WHOLE  WORLD.  Without  doubt  as <br/>the  black,  pitchy  matter  will  and  must  of  necessity  become  White  and  Red,  and  the  Red  having  been <br/>carried  to  perfection,  medicinally  and  for  Metals,  is  then  fully  capable  to  preserve  mentem  sanam  in <br/>corpore  sano  until  the  natural  period  of  Life  and  promise  us  ample  means,  in  infinitum  multipliable, <br/>to  be  benevolent  and  charitable  without  any  diminution  of  our  inexhaustible  resources,  therefore  well <br/>may  it  be  called  the  Glory  [Honours]  of  the  Whole  World,  as  truly  the  study  and  contemplation  of  the <br/>L.  P.  [Lapis  Philosophorum],  harmonising  with  Divine  Truths,  elevates  the  mind  to  God  our  Creator <br/>and  merciful  Father,  and  if  He  should  permit  us  to  possess  it  practically  must  eradicate  the  very <br/>principle  of  Avarice,  Envy,  and  Evil  Inclinations,  and  cause  our  hearts  to  melt  in  gratitude  toward <br/>Him  that  has  been  so  kind  to  us!  Therefore  the  Philosophers  say  with  great  Truth,  that  the  L.  P.  either <br/>finds  a  good  man  or  makes  one. <br/><br/>&quot;AND  DARKNESS  WILL  FLY  FROM  THEE.  By  invigorating  the  Organs  the  Soul  makes  use  of  for <br/>communicating  with  exterior  objects,  the  Soul  must  acquire  greater  powers  not  only  for  conception <br/>but  also  for  retention,  and  therefore  if  we  wish  to  obtain  still  more  knowledge,  the  organs  and  secret <br/>springs  of  physical  life  being  wonderfully  strengthened  and  invigorated,  the  Soul  must  acquire  new <br/>powers  for  conceiving  and  retaining,  especially  if  we  pray  to  God  for  knowledge,  and  confirm  our <br/>prayers  by  faith,  all  Obscurity  must  vanish  of  course.  That  this  has  not  been  the  case  with  all <br/>possessors,  was  their  own  fault,  as  they  contented  themselves  merely  with  the  Transmutation  of <br/>Metals. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;(Use.)  THIS  IS  THE  STRENGTH  OF  ALL  POWERS.  This  is  a  very  strong  figure,  to  indicate  that  the <br/>L.  P.  positively  does  possess  all  the  Powers  concealed  in  Nature,  not  for  destruction  but  for  exaltation <br/>and  regeneration  of  matter,  in  the  three  Departments  of  Nature. <br/><br/>&quot;WITH  THIS  THOU  WILT  BE  ABLE  TO  OVERCOME  ALL  THINGS,  AND  TO  TRANSMUTE  ALL <br/><br/>Add <br/><br/>WHAT  IS  FINE  (&#x25a1;  &#x25a1;)  AND  WHAT  IS  COARSE  (&#x25a1;  &#x25a1;  ?  6^  &#x25a1;         ).  It  will  conquer  every  subtil <br/>Thing,  of  course,  as  it  refixes  the  most  subtil  Oxygen  into  its  own  fiery  Nature  and  that  with  more <br/>power,  penetration  and  virtue,  in  a  tenfold  ratio,  at  every  multiplication,  and  each  time  in  a  much <br/><br/><br/>shorter  period,  until  its  power  becomes  incalculable,  which  multiplied  power  also  penetrates <br/><br/>[overcomes]  every  Solid  Thing,  such  as  unconquerable  Gold  and  Silver,  the  otherwise  unalterable <br/>Mercury,  Crystals  and  Glass  Fluxes,  to  which  it  is  able  to  give  natural  hardness  and  fixity,  as <br/>Philaletha  does  attest,  and  is  proved  by  an  artificial  Diamond,  in  my  father's  time,  in  possession  of <br/>Prince  Lichtenstein  in  Vienna,  valued  at  Five  Hundred  Thousand  Ducats,  fixed  by  the  Lapis <br/>[Philosopher's  Stone]. <br/><br/>&quot;IN  THIS  MANNER  THE  WORLD  WAS  CREATED;  THE  ARRANGEMENTS  TO  FOLLOW  THIS <br/>ROAD  ARE  HIDDEN.  FOR  THIS  REASON  I  AM  CALLED  CHIRAM  TELAT MECHASOT,  ONE  IN <br/>ESSENCE,  BUT  THREE  IN  ASPECT.  IN  THIS  TRINITY  IS  HIDDEN  THE  WISDOM  OF  THE <br/>WHOLE  WORLD  (i.e.,  in  Chiram  and  its  Use).  It  is  thought  that  Hermes  was  Moses  or  Zoroaster, <br/>otherwise  Hermes  signifies  a  Serpent,  and  the  Serpent  used  to  be  an  Emblem  of  Knowledge  or <br/>Wisdom.  The  Serpent  is  met  with  ever3^here  amongst  the  Hieroglyphics  of  the  ancient  Egyptians,  so <br/>is  the  Globe  with  Wings,  the  Sun  and  Moon,  Dragons  and  Griffins,  whereby  the  Egyptians  denoted <br/>their  sublime  knowledge  of  the  Lapis  Philosophorum,  according  to  Suidas,  the  hints  in  the  Scriptures, <br/>and  even  De  Non  where  he  speaks  of  the  sanctuaries  of  the  ancient  Egyptian  Temples. <br/><br/>&quot;IT  IS  ENDED  NOW,  WHAT  I  HAVE  SAID  CONCERNING  THE  EFFECTS  OF  THE  SUN.  FINISH  OF <br/>THE  TABULA  SMARAGDINA.  What  I  have  said  or  taught  of  the  Solar  Work,  is  now  finished.  The <br/>perfect  Seed,  fit  for  multiplication. <br/><br/>&quot;This  I  know  is  acknowledged  to  be  the  genuine  Tabula  Smaragdina  Hermetis.&quot; <br/><br/>A  LETTER  FROM  THE <br/>BROTHERS  OF  R.  C.  (ROSE  CROSS) <br/><br/>Although  Eugenius  Philalethes  disclaimed  membership  in  the  Rosicrucian  Fraternity,  it  is  believed <br/>that  for  a  number  of  years  he  was  the  head  of  that  Order.  In  a  little  work  called  Lumen  de  Lumine,  or <br/>A  New  Magical  Light  Discovered  and  Communicated  to  the  World,  published  in  London  in  1651, <br/>Eugenius  Philalethes  gives  a  remarkable  letter,  presumably  from  the  Rosicrucian  Order. <br/>Accompanying  the  letter  is  an  emblematic  figure  setting  forth  in  symbolic  form  the  processes  and <br/>formulce  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone.  This  epistle  is  an  excellent  example  of  the  Rosicrucian  system  of <br/>combining  abstract  theological  speculations  with  concrete  chemical  formulse.  With  the  aid  of  the <br/>material  contained  in  various  parts  of  this  present  book  the  student  would  do  well  to  set  himself  the <br/>task  of  solving  the  riddle  contained  in  this  hieroglyph. <br/><br/>&quot;A  Letter  from  the  Brothers  ofR.  C.  Concerning  the  Invisible,  Magical  Mountain,  And  the  Treasure <br/>therein  Contained. <br/><br/>&quot;Every  man  naturally  desires  a  superiority,  to  have  treasures  of  Gold  and  Silver  [intellect  and  soul], <br/>and  to  seem  great  in  the  eyes  of  the  world.  God  indeed  created  all  things  for  the  use  of  man,  that  he <br/>might  rule  over  them,  and  acknowledge  therein  the  singular  goodness  and  omnipotence  of  God,  give <br/>Him  thanks  for  His  benefits,  honor  Him  and  praise  Him.  But  there  is  no  man  looks  after  these  things, <br/>otherwise  than  by  spending  his  days  idly;  they  would  enjoy  them  without  any  previous  labor  and <br/>danger;  neither  do  they  look  them  out  of  that  place  where  God  hath  treasured  them  up.  Who  expects <br/>also  that  man  should  seek  for  them  there,  and  to  those  that  seek  will  He  give  them.  But  there  is  not <br/>any  that  labors  for  a  possession  in  that  place,  and  therefore  these  riches  are  not  found:  For  the  way  to <br/>this  place,  and  the  place  itself  hath  been  unknown  for  a  long  time,  and  it  is  hidden  from  the  greatest <br/>part  of  the  world.  But  notwithstanding  it  be  difficult  and  laborious  to  find  Out  this  way  and  place,  yet <br/>the  place  should  be  sought  after. <br/><br/>&quot;But  it  is  not  the  will  of  God  to  conceal  anything  from  those  that  are  His,  and  therefore  in  this  last  age, <br/>before  the  final  judgment  comes,  all  these  things  shall  be  manifested  to  those  that  are  worthy:  As  He <br/><br/><br/>Himself  (though  obscurely,  lest  it  should  be  manifested  to,  the  unworthy)  hath  spoken  in  a  certain <br/><br/>place:  There  is  nothing  covered  that  shall  not  be  revealed,  and  hidden  that  shall  not  be  known.  We <br/>therefore  being  moved  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  do  declare  the  will  of  God  to  the  world,  which  we  have <br/>also  already  performed  and  published  in  several  languages.  But  most  men  either  revile,  or  contemne <br/>that,  our  Manifesto,  (the  Fama  and  Confessio  Fraternitatis)  or  else  waiving  the  Spirit  of  God,  they <br/>expect  the  proposals  thereof  from  us,  supposing  we  will  straightway  teach  them  how  to  make  gold  by <br/>Art,  or  furnish  them  with  ample  treasures,  whereby  they  may  live  pompously  in  the  face  of  the  world, <br/>swagger,  and  make  wars,  turn  usurers,  gluttons,  and  drunkards,  live  unchastely,  and  defile  their <br/>whole  life  With  several  other  sins,  all  which  things  are  contrary  to  the  blessed  will  of  God.  These  men <br/>should  have  learnt  from  those  Ten  Virgins  (whereof  five  that  were  foolish  demanded  oil  for  their <br/>lamps,  from  those  five  that  were  wise)  how  that  the  case  is  much  otherwise. <br/><br/>P159 <br/><br/>&quot;It  is  expedient  that  every  man  should  labor  for  this  treasure  by  the  assistance  of  God,  and  his  own <br/>particular  search  and  industry.  But  the  perverse  intentions  of  these  fellows  we  understand  out  of  their <br/>own  writings,  by  the  singular  grace  and  revelation  of  God.  We  do  stop  our  ears,  and  wrap  ourselves  as <br/>it  were  in  clouds,  to  avoid  the  bellowings  and  bowlings  of  those  men,  who  in  vain  cry  out  for  gold.  And <br/>hence  indeed  it  comes  to  pass  that  they  brand  us  with  infinite  calumnies  and  slanders,  which <br/>notwithstanding  we  do  not  resent  but  God  in  His  good  time  will  judge  them  for  it.  But  after  that  we <br/>had  well  known  (though  unknown  to  you)  and  perceived  also  by  your  writing  how  diligently  you  are <br/>to  peruse  the  Holy  Scripture,  and  seek  the  true  knowledge  of  God:  we  have  also  above  many <br/>thousands,  thought  you  worthy  of  some  answer,  and  we  signify  this  much  to  you  by  the  will  of  God <br/>and  the  admonition  of  the  Holy  Ghost. <br/><br/>&quot;There  is  a  mountain  situated  in  the  midst  of  the  earth,  or  center  of  the  world,  which  is  both  small  and <br/>great.  It  is  soft,  also  above  measure  hard  and  stony.  It  is  far  off,  and  near  at  hand,  but  by  the <br/>providence  of  God,  invisible.  In  it  are  hidden  most  ample  treasures,  which  the  world  is  not  able  to <br/>value.  This  mountain  by  envy  of  the  devil,  who  always  opposeth  the  glory  of  God  and  the  happiness  of <br/>man,  is  compassed  about  with  very  cruel  beasts  and  other  [sic]  ravenous  birds,  which  make  the  way <br/>thither  both  difficult  and  dangerous;  and  therefore  hitherto,  because  the  time  is  not  yet  come,  the  way <br/>thither  could  not  be  sought  after  nor  found  out.  But  now  at  last  the  way  is  to  be  found  by  those  that <br/>are  worthy,  but  notwithstanding  by  every  man's  self -labor  and  endeavors. <br/><br/>&quot;To  this  mountain  you  shall  go  in  a  certain  night  (when  it:  comes)  most  long  and  most  dark,  and  see <br/>that  you  prepare  yourselves  by  prayer.  Insist  upon  the  way  that:  leads  to  the  mountain,  but  ask  not  of <br/>any  man  where  the  way  lies:  only  follow  your  Guide,  who  will  offer  himself  to  you,  and  will  meet  you <br/>in  the  way  but  you  shall  not  know  him.  This  Guide  will  bring  you  to  the  mountain  at  midnight,  when <br/>all  things  are  silent  and  dark.  It  is  necessary  that  you  arm  yourselves  with  a  resolute  heroic  courage, <br/>lest  you  fear  those  things  that  will  happen,  and  so  fall  back.  You  need  no  sword,  nor  any  other  bodily <br/>weapons,  only  call  upon  God  sincerely  and  heartily. <br/><br/>&quot;When  you  have  discovered  the  mountain,  the  first  miracle  that  will  appear  is  this.  A  most  vehement <br/>and  very  great  wind,  that  will  shake  the  mountain  and  shatter  the  rocks  to  pieces.  You  shall  be <br/>encountered  also  by  lions  and  dragons  and  other  terrible  beasts,  but  fear  not  any  of  these  things.  Be <br/>resolute  and  rake  heed  that  you  return  not,  for  your  Guide  who  brought  you  thither  will  not  suffer  any <br/>evil  to  befall  you.  As  for  the  treasure,  it  is  not  yet  discovered  but  it  is  very  near.  After  this  wind  will <br/>come  an  earthquake,  that  will  overthrow  those  things  which  the  wind  hath  left  and  make  all  flat.  But <br/>be  sure  that  you  fall  not  off. <br/><br/>&quot;The  earthquake  being  past,  there  shall  follow  afire,  that  will  consume  the  earthly  rubbish,  and <br/>discover  the  treasure,  but  as  yet  you  cannot  see  it.  After  all  these  things  and  near  the  daybreak  there <br/>shall  be  a  great  calm,  and  you  shall  see  the  Day-Star  arise  and  the  dawning  will  appear,  and  you  shall <br/><br/><br/>perceive  a  great  treasure.  The  chiefest  thing  in  it,  and  the  most  perfect,  is  a  certain  exalted  tincture, <br/>with  which  the  world  (if  it  served  God  and  were  worthy  of  such  gifts)  might  be  tinged  and  turned  into <br/>most  pure  gold. <br/><br/>&quot;This  tincture  being  used,  as  your  Guide  shall  reach  you,  will  make  you  young  when  you  are  old,  and <br/>you  shall  perceive  no  disease  in  any  part  of  your  bodies.  By  means  of  this  tincture  also  you  shall  find <br/>pearls  of  that  excellency  which  cannot  be  imagined.  But  do  not  you  arrogate  anything  to  yourselves <br/>because  of  your  present  power,  but  be  contented  with  that  which  your  Guide  shall  communicate  to <br/>you.  Praise  God  perpetually  for  this  His  gift,  and  have  a  special  care  that  you  use  it  not  for  worldly <br/>pride,  but  employ  it  in  such  works  which  are  contrary  to  the  world.  Use  it  rightly  and  enjoy  it  so,  as  if <br/>you  had  it  not.  Live  a  temperate  life,  and  beware  of  all  sin,  otherwise  your  Guide  will  forsake  you,  and <br/>you  shall  be  deprived  of  this  happiness.  For  know  this  of  a  truth,  whosoever  abuseth  this  tincture  and <br/>lives  not  exemplarly,  purely,  and  devoutly  before  men  he  shall  lose  this  benefit,  and  scarce  any  hope <br/>will  there  be  left  ever  to  recover  it  afterwards.&quot; <br/><br/>If,  as  transcendentalists  believe,  the  initiations  into  the  Fraternity  of  the  Rose  Cross  were  given  in  the <br/>invisible  worlds  which  surround  and  interpenetrate  the  visible  universe,  it  is  not  beyond  the  range  of <br/>possibility  that  this  allegory  is  to  be  considered  in  the  light  of  an  initiatory  ritual  as  well  as  an <br/>alchemical  formula. <br/><br/>As  has  been  noted,  it  is  difficult  to  secure  a  complete  formula  for  any  of  the  alchemical  operations. <br/>The  one  presented  here  is  the  most  nearly  complete  of  any  available.  The  collecting  of  the  rays  and <br/>energies  of  the  celestial  bodies  as  precipitated  in  dew  is  a  process  which  Paracelsus  used  with  great <br/>success.  Bear  constantly  in  mind  that  these  processes  are  only  for  those  who  have  been  properly <br/>instructed  in  the  secret  art. <br/><br/>&quot;A  TRUE  REVELATION  OF  THE  MANUAL  OPERATION  FOR  THE  UNIVERSAL  MEDICINE <br/>COMMONLY  CALLED  'THE  PHILOSOPHER 'S  STONE. '  By  the  celebrated  philosopher  of  Leyden,  as <br/>attested  upon  his  deathbed  with  his  own  Blood,  Anno  Domini  1662.  To  my  Loving  Cousin  and  Son, <br/>the  True  Hermetic  Philosopher&#x2014; <br/><br/>&quot;Dear  Loving  Cousin  and  Son: <br/><br/>&quot;Although  I  had  resolved  never  to  give  in  writing  to  any  person  the  secret  of  the  Ancient  Sages,  yet <br/>notwithstanding  out  of  peculiar  affection  and  love  to  you,  I  have  taken  it  upon  me,  to  which  the <br/>nearness  of  our  relation  obliges  me,  and  especially  because  this  temporal  life  is  short,  and  Art  is  very <br/>dark  and  you  may  therefore  not  attain  the  wished  for  end;~but  my  Son  because  so  precious  a  jewel <br/>belongs  not  to  swine;  and  also  this  so  great  a  gift  of  God  maybe  treated  carefully  and  Christianlike,  in <br/>consideration  thereof  I  do  so  largely  declare  myself  to  thee. <br/><br/>&quot;I  conjure  thee  with  hand  and  mouth  sacredly; <br/><br/>&quot;1st.  That  most  especially  thou  faithfully  keep  the  same  from  all  wicked,  lustful  and  criminal  persons. <br/>&quot;2dly.  That  thou  exalt  not  thyself  in  any  way. <br/><br/>&quot;sdly.  That  thou  seek  to  advance  the  honor  of  thy  Creator  of  all  things  and  the  good  of  thy  neighbor, <br/><br/>preserve  it  sacredly  that  thy  Lord  may  not  have  cause  to  complain  of  thee  at  the  last  day.  I  have <br/>written  here  in  this  treatise  such  a  part  of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  just  as  I  myself  have  worked  this <br/>treasure  and  finished  it  with  my  fingers,  therefore  I  have  subscribed  all  this  work  with  my  blood,  lying <br/>on  my  deathbed  in  Leyden. <br/><br/><br/>&quot;THE  PROCESS&#x2014; In  the  Name  of  God,  take  of  the  purest  and  cleanest  salt,  sea  salt,  so  as  it  is  made  by <br/>the  sun  itself,  such  as  is  brought  by  shipping  from  Spain,  (I  used  salt  that  came  from  St.  Uber)  let  it  be <br/>dried  in  a  warm  stove,  grind  it  in  a  stone  mortar,  as  fine  as  possible  to  a  powder  that  it  may  be  so <br/>much  the  easier  dissolve  and  taken  up  by  our  Dew-water,  which  is  thus  to  be  had  in  the  months  of <br/>May  or  June:  When  the  Moon  is  at  the  full,  observe  when  the  dew  falls  with  an  East  or  South  East <br/>wind.  Then  you  must  have  sticks  about  one  and  a  half  feet  high  above  the  ground  when  driven  in  the <br/>Earth.  Upon  two  or  three  such  sticks,  lay  some  four  square  plates  of  glass,  and  as  the  dew  falls  it  easily <br/>fastens  on  the  glass  like  a  vapour,  then  have  glass  Vessels  in  readiness,  let  the  dew  drain  from  the <br/>sides  of  the  glasses  into  your  vessels.  Do  this  until  you  have  enough.  The  full  of  the  Moon  is  a  good <br/>season,  afterwards  it  will  be  hard.&quot; <br/><br/>The  solar  rays  descending  from  the  sun  carry  with  them  solar  sulphur&#x2014;the  Divine  Fire.  These  rays  are <br/>crystallized  by  contact  with <br/><br/><br/>THE  INVISIBLE  MAGICAL  MOUNTAIN. <br/><br/><br/>From  Phililethales'  Lumen  de  Lumine. <br/><br/><br/>On  Page  24  of  Lumen  de  Lumine,  Eugenius  Philalethes  describes  the  magical  mountain  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;This  is  that  emblematical  magical  type,  which  Thalia  delivered  to  me  in  the  invisible  Guiana.  The  first  and  superior  Part <br/>of  it  represents  the  Mountains  of  the  Moon.  The  philosophers  commonly  call  them  the  Mountains  of  India,  on  whose  tops <br/>grows  their  secret  and  famous  Lunaria.  It  is  an  Herb  easy  to  be  found,  but  [for  the  fact]  that  men  are  blind  discovers  itself <br/>and  shines  after  night  like  pearl.  The  earth  of  these  mountains  is  very  red  and  soft  beyond  all  expression.  It  is  full  of <br/>crystalline  rocks,  which  the  philosophers  call  their  glass  and  their  stone:  birds  and  fish  (say  they)  bring  it  to  them.  Of  these <br/>mountains  speaks  Hali  the  Arabian,  a  most  excellent  judicious  author:  'Go,  my  son,  to  the  Mountains  of  India,  and  to  their <br/>quarries  or  caverns,  and  take  thence  our  precious  stones  which  dissolve  or  melt  in  water,  when  they  are  mingled  therewith. <br/>Much  indeed  might  be  spoken  of  these  mountains,  if  it  were  lawful  to  publish  their  mysteries,  but  one  thing  I  shall  not <br/>forbear  to  tell  you.  They  are  very  dangerous  places  after  night,  for  they  are  haunted  with  fires  and  other  strange <br/>apparitions,  (as  a  I  am  told  by  the  Magi)  by  certain  spirits,  which  dabble  lasciviously  with  the  sperm  of  the  world  and <br/>imprint  their  imaginations  in,  producing  many  times  fantastic  and  monstrous  generations.  The  access  and  pilgrimage  to <br/>this  place,  with  the  difficulties  which  attend  them,  are  faithfully  and  magisterially  described  by  the  Brothers  of  R.C.&quot;  (Set <br/>accompanying  letter.) <br/><br/>p.  160 <br/><br/>the  lunar  rays.  The  solar  rays  are  also  met  by  the  emanations  pouring  upward  from  the  earth's  surface <br/>and  are  thus  still  further  crystallized  into  a  partly  tangible  substance,  which  is  soluble  in  pure  water. <br/>This  substance  is  the  &quot;Magical  Mountain  of  the  Moon&quot;  referred  to  in  the  R.  C.  letter.  The <br/>crystallization  of  the  solar  and  lunar  rays  in  water  (dew)  produces  the  virgin  earth&#x2014;a  pure,  invisible <br/>substance,  uncontaminated  by  material  matter.  When  the  virgin  earth  crystals  are  wet,  they  appear <br/>green;  when  dry,  white. <br/><br/>Von  Welling  makes  a  suggestion  for  the  extraction  of  the  solar  life  from  stagnant  water,  but  is  reticent <br/>both  as  to  naming  the  essence  extracted  and  also  as  to  the  various  processes  through  which  it  must <br/>pass  to  be  refined  and  increased  in  power.  His  hint,  however,  is  both  valuable  and  unusual: <br/><br/>&quot;Take  sweet  clean  water  and  seal  it  in  a  large  bottle,  leaving  about  one-fourth  empty.  Place  the  bottle <br/><br/>in  the  sun  for  some  weeks  until  it  rots,  showing  a  precipitation  in  the  bottom.  This  precipitation, <br/>when  properly  manipulated  by  distillation,  will  produce  a  clear,  fiery,  burning  oil,  the  constituents <br/>and  use  of  which  are  only  known  to  the  wise.&quot; <br/><br/>The  philosopher  of  Leyden  continues:  &quot;Now  when  you  have  enough  of  your  dew  close  your  glasses <br/>exactly,  and  keep  it  till  you  use  it,  that  none  of  its  spirits  may  evaporate,  which  may  easily  happen.  Set <br/>it  therefore  in  a  cool  place,  that  no  warmth  may  come  to  it,  or  else  the  subtle  spirit  will  rise  and  be <br/>gone;  which  will  not  so  happen  if  after  you  have  filled  your  glasses  with  Dew  quite  full,  you  close  them <br/>very  well  with  wax. <br/><br/>&quot;Now  in  the  Name  of  God,  take  of  this  Dew-water  as  much  as  thou  wilt,  put  in  a  clean  dissolving  glass, <br/>then  cast  a  little  of  your  forementioned  powdered  salt  into  it  to  be  dissolved,  and  continue  to  put  it  in <br/>till  your  Dew-water  will  dissolve  no  more  or  till  the  salt  lies  in  it  four  days  without  being  dissolved, <br/>then  it  has  enough,  and  unto  your  Dew  is  given  its  proper  powder.  Of  this  compounded  water,  take  as <br/>much  as  thou  wilt,  I  took  about  a  pound  and  a  half,  and  put  it  into  a  round  vial  with  a  short  neck,  fill  it <br/>with  out  water  and  lute  it  with  a  good  lute,  a  cover  and  stopple  that  fits  it  well,  that  the  subtle  and <br/>living  spirit  of  the  dew  may  not  fume  away,  for  if  they  should  the  soul  of  the  salt  will  never  be  stirred <br/>up,  nor  the  work  ever  brought  to  a  right  end.  Let  the  lute  dry  very  well  of  itself,  and  set  it  in  the <br/>furnace  of  B.  M.  to  putrefy.  Make  a  slow  fire  and  let  it  digest  for  forty  days  or  fifty,  and  that  the  fume <br/>of  the  water  be  continually  round  about  it,  and  you  will  see  your  matter  grow  black,  which  is  a  token <br/>of  its  putrefaction. <br/><br/>&quot;As  soon  as  you  have  taken  it  out,  have  your  dry  furnace  ready.  Set  your  glass  with  the  matter  into  an <br/>inner  globe  to  coagulate,  give  it  a  slow  degree  of  fire,  continue  it  equally  for  twelve  or  fifteen  days,  and <br/>your  matter  will  begin  to  coagulate  and  to  fasten  round  about  your  glass  like  a  gray  salt,  which  as  soon <br/><br/><br/>as  you  see  and  before  it  be  two  days,  slacken  the  fire  that  it  may  cool  leisurely.  Then  have  in  readiness <br/>your  putrefying  furnace  as  before.  Set  your  glass  therein  and  give  the  same  degree  of  fire  as  before. <br/>Let  it  stand  twelve  days,  and  again  you  will  see  the  matter  resolve  and  open  as  before,  and  open  itself, <br/>but  you  must  every  time  see  that  the  lute  and  your  glass  is  not  hurt.  When  you  set  your  glass  in  the <br/>putrefying  furnace,  take  care  that  the  neck  of  your  glass  is  covered  with  a  wooden  or  glass  stopper <br/>that  fits  it  exactly,  that  the  moisture  of  the  water  may  not  come  at  it. <br/><br/>&quot;When  you  see  it  black  set  your  glass  as  before  to  coagulate  and  when  it  begins  to  be  of  a  grayish  color <br/>and  whitish,  set  it  in  a  third  time  to  putrefy,  and  coagulate  to  the  fifth  time,  until  you  see  that  your <br/>water  in  its  dissolution  is  clean,  pellucid  and  clear,  and  that  it  appears  in  its  Calcination  of  a  fine <br/>white  like  Snow.  Then  it  is  prepared  and  becomes  a  Salt  fixed  which  will  melt  on  hot  Silver  plate  like <br/>wax;  but  before  you  set  this  your  Salt  out,  set  it  again  [in]  the  furnace  of  putrefaction  that  it  may <br/>dissolve  of  itself,  then  let  it  cool,  open  your  Glass  and  you  will  find  your  Matter  lessened  a  third  part. <br/>But  instead  of  your  former  Salt  Water  you  will  have  a  fine  Sweet  and  very  penetrating  Water  which <br/>the  Philosophers  have  hid  under  very  wonderful  Names&#x2014;It  is  the  Mercury  of  all  true  Philosophers, <br/>the  Water  out  of  which  comes  Gold  and  Silver,  for  they  say  its  Father  is  Gold  and  its  Mother  is  Silver. <br/>Thus  hast  thou  the  strength  of  both  these  Luminaries  conjoined  in  this  Water,  most  true,  in  its  right <br/>Pondus. <br/><br/>&quot;Prescription.  5  Drops  of  this  Water  taken  inwardly  strengthens  the  understanding  and  memory,  and <br/>opens  to  us  most  wonderful  and  sweet  things,  of  which  no  man  hath  heard,  and  of  which  I  dare  not <br/>further  write,  because  of  the  Oath  I  made  God  to  the  contrary.  Time  and  the  holy  use  of  this  blessed <br/>Water  will  teach  us,  as  soon  as  you  have  taken  it  inwardly  such  influence  will  happen  to  thee  as  if  the <br/>whole  heavens  and  all  the  stars  with  their  powers  are  working  in  thee.  All  Knowledge  and  secret  Arts <br/>will  be  opened  to  thee  as  in  a  dream,  but  the  most  excellent  of  all  is,  you  will  perfectly  learn  rightly  to <br/>know  all  creatures  in  their  Nature,  and  by  means  thereof,  the  true  understanding  of  God,  the  Creator <br/>of  us,  Heaven  and  Earth,  like  David  and  Moses  and  all  the  Saints  of  God,  for  the  wisdom  of  our <br/>fountain  of  living  Water  will  instruct  thee  as  it  did  Solomon  and  the  Brethren  of  our  fraternity.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  rare  treatise  on  Salt,  Sulphur  and  Mercury,  von  Welling  discloses  a  secret:  not  generally <br/><br/>revealed  in  alchemical  writings,  namely,  that  the  alchemists  were  concerned  not  only  with  the <br/>transmutation  of  metals  but  had  a  complete  cosmological  and  philosophical  system  based  upon  the <br/>Qabbalah. <br/><br/>According  to  von  Welling,  the  universal  salt  (in  watery  form)  is  a  positive  cure  for  all  the  physical <br/>ailments  of  mankind;  it  is  in  every  living  thing,  but  from  some  things  it  is  more  easily  secured  than <br/>from  others:  especially  is  this  true  of  virgin  earth;  it  is  the  universal  solvent,  the  alkahest.  The  same <br/>writer  also  states  that  in  the  first  stages  of  its  preparation  this  salt  will  cure  any  and  all  diseases  of  the <br/>heart.  The  anonymous  philosopher  of  Leyden  continues: <br/><br/>&quot;Would  you  now  proceed  further  with  our  blessed  Water  to  the  forementioned  intention  of  preparing <br/>a  Tincture  for  Metals,  hearken  my  Son~ <br/><br/>&quot;Take  in  the  NAME  of  the  Lord,  of  thy  Paradisiacal  Water,  of  heavenly  Water  of  Mercury,  as  much  as <br/>thou  wilt,  put  it  into  a  glass  to  dissolve,  and  set  it  in  a  slow  heat  of  Ashes,  that  it  may  just  feel  the <br/>warmth,  then  have  ready  well  purified  Gold  for  the  Red,  or  Silver  for  the  White  Elixir,  for  in  both  the <br/>Processes  are  the  same.  Let  your  Gold  or  Silver  be  beaten  as  thin  as  leaf  Gold,  cast  it  by  degrees  into <br/>your  dissolving  Glass,  that  contains  your  blessed  Water,  as  you  did  in  the  beginning  with  your  Salt, <br/>and  it  will  melt  like  Ice  in  Warm  Water,  and  continue  so  to  do  till  your  Gold  or  Silver  lie  therein  four <br/>days  without  dissolving,  then  it  has  received  its  due  Pondus.  Then  put  this  dissolution  as  before  into  a <br/>round  Glass,  fill  it  two  thirds  parts  full,  seal  it  hermetically  as  before,  let  your  Sigillum  be  well  dried. <br/>Set  it  in  the  furnace  of  Balneum  Vapori,  make  a  fire  and  let  it  remain  forty  days,  as  before,  then  will <br/><br/><br/>the  Gold  or  Silver  be  dissolved  radically  and  will  turn  of  the  deepest  black  in  the  world,  which  as  soon <br/>as  you  see,  have  your  other  drying  furnace  in  readiness.&quot; <br/><br/>Continuing:  &quot;Philosophers  say  there  is  no  true  solution  of  the  body  without  a  proceeding  coagulation <br/>of  the  spirit,  for  they  are  interchangeably  mixed  in  a  due  proportion,  whereby  the  bodily  essence <br/>becomes  of  a  spiritual  penetrating  nature.  On  the  other  hand,  the  incomprehensible  spiritual  essential <br/>virtue  is  also  made  corporeal  by  the  fire,  because  there  is  made  between  them  so  near  a  relation  or <br/>friendship,  like  as  the  heavens  operate  to  the  very  Depth  of  Earth,  and  producing  from  thence  all  the <br/>treasures  and  riches  of  the  whole  World. <br/><br/>&quot;Admirandum  Naturae  Operationem  in  Archidoxes  Cognitam. <br/><br/>&quot;With  this  Powder&#x2014; You  may  as  follows  project  on  metals.  Take  five  parts  of  fine  Gold  or  Silver <br/>according  as  you  work,  and  melt  it  in  a  Crucible.  Wrap  up  your  Medicine  in  Wax,  cast  it  therein,  give  a <br/>strong  fire  for  an  hour,  then  take  the  Crucible  out,  as  it  were,  calcined,  then  cast  one  part  on  ten  parts <br/>of  imperfect  metals,  be  it  what  it  will,  and  the  same  will  be  immediately  changed  into  purer  Metal, <br/>than  what  is  brought  out  of  the  Mines  and  produced  by  Melting;  and  when  you  augment  it  in  strength <br/>and  virtue  by  resolving  and  coagulating,  the  fifth  time  it  will  resolve  itself  in  three  days  and  be <br/>coagulated  in  twenty-four  hours  time,  to  an  incredible  and  most  highly  pellucid  Stone  or  Red  Shining <br/>burning  Coal.  For  the  white  work  it  will  become  like  a  white  stream  of  Lightning. <br/><br/>&quot;Of  this  last  coagulation  take  one  part,  cast  it  upon  five  thousand  of  melted  Gold  or  Silver  as  before.  It <br/>changes  the  same  into  perfect  Medicine,  one  part  whereof  will  tinge  one  hundred  thousand  parts  of <br/>melted  imperfect  Metals  into  the  very  finest  Gold  or  Silver.  So  far  I  have  brought  and  further  I  would <br/>not  come,  for  as  I  would  set  in  the  matter  [to  distill]  six  times  in  twelve  hours,  it  subtilized  so  highly <br/>that  the  most  part  (like  somewhat  most  wonderful  to  behold)  past  through  the  Glass  causing  an <br/>inexpressible  odoriferous  Smell.

Ai <br/><br/>THE  HERMETIC  AND  ALCHEMICAL <br/>FIGURES  OF  CLAUDIUS  DE  DOMINICO <br/>CELENTANO  VALLIS  NOVI  FROM  A <br/><br/>MANUSCRIPT  WRITTEN  AND <br/>ILLUMINATED  AT  NAPLES  A.D.  i6o6 <br/><br/>No  better  way  can  be  found  of  introducing  to  the  &quot;Royal  Art&quot;  a  seeker  after  the  mysteries  of <br/>symboHcal  philosophy  than  to  place  at  his  disposal  an  actual  example  of  alchemical  writing.  The  text <br/>of  this  manuscript  is  as  enigmatic  as  are  its  diagrams;  but  to  him  who  will  meditate  upon  the <br/>profound  significance  of  both,  the  deeper  issues  of  mysticism  in  due  time  will  be  made  clear.  An <br/>unknown  person  through  whose  hands  this  manuscript  passed  wrote  thus  of  it: <br/><br/>&quot;Because  of  its  drawings  and  illustrated  expositions,  the  manuscript  is  of  preeminent  importance  to <br/>the  Rosicrucians  and  the  contemporary  order  of  Freemasons.  The  first,  and  larger,  part  of  the <br/>illustrations  deals  with  the  Hermetic  philosophy,  explaining  its  teachings  and  doctrines.  Interspersed <br/>among  these  are  portraits  of  great  teachers  and  satirical  representations  of  bunglers  and  their <br/>mistaken  views.  The  systematically  arranged  part  shows  with  wonderful  clearness  the  color <br/>development  of  the  alchemical  processes  from  blue-gold  over  black  to  white  and  rose.  Throughout  it <br/>treats  of  the  change  in  human  beings  and  not  of  the  making  of  gold.  Ever  upon  the  Grade  of  Black <br/>(the  return  into  Chaos  from  which  new  creations  are  possible)  follows  the  Grade  of  the  Neophytes,  the <br/>New  Birth,  which  is  often  repeated  with  impressive  lucidity.  The  black  stage  occurs  as  usual  through <br/>fire.  This  unopened  and  unpublished  manuscript  belongs  to  the  order  of  the  most  important  Precepts <br/>and  Documents  of  the  Rosicrucians,  and  Freemasons.  A  search  through  the  museums  and  library <br/>collections  of  Germany  has  failed  to  reveal  any  item  of  even  a  similar  character.&quot; <br/><br/>In  addition  to  the  26  leaves  here  reproduced  there  are  ten  bottles  or  retorts,  each  half  filled  with <br/><br/>varicolored  substances.  These  bottles  can  be  so  easily  described  that  it  is  unnecessary  to  reproduce <br/>them.  The  first  bottle  (from  the  mouth  of  which  issues  a  golden  shrub  with  three  blossoms)  contains  a <br/>bluish-gray  liquid,  the  entire  figure  being  called  &quot;Our  Quicksilver.&quot;  Under  the  vessel  is  a  verse <br/>containing  the  significant  words:  &quot;He  will  have  white  garments  for  black  and  then  red.&quot;  The  second <br/>bottle  (from  the  neck  of  which  rise  four  golden  flowers)  also  contains  the  bluish-gray  substance <br/>termed  quicksilver.  Below  the  bottle  is  the  admonition  to  &quot;make  spirit  of  the  body  and  grace  of  the <br/>gross,  that  the  corporeal  may  become  incorporeal.&quot; <br/><br/>The  third  bottle  is  entirely  black  save  for  a  golden  tree  trunk  having  six  lopped-off  branches  and <br/>terminating  in  five  branches  which  end  in  knobs  and  protrude  from  the  neck  of  the  bottle.  The  state <br/>of  the  substance  is  termed  &quot;Blackness  showing  through  the  Head  of  the  Raven.&quot;  Under  the  bottle <br/>occurs  the  statement  that  &quot;the  tincture  of  the  Philosophers  is  hidden  in  the  air  like  the  soul  in  the <br/>human  body.&quot;  The  fourth  bottle  is  of  the  deepest  blackness  and  is  called  &quot;The  Head  of  the  Raven.&quot; <br/>Nothing  rises  from  the  neck  of  the  vessel,  for  the  earth  (its  contents)  is  described  as  &quot;submerged  in <br/>Chaos.&quot;  The  bottom  of  the  fifth  bottle  contains  a  bluish-gray,  spotted  liquid,  the  upper  part  being <br/>filled  with  a  brick-colored  substance.  Above  are  the  words:  &quot;Sixth  Raven's  Head&quot;;  below  is  added:  &quot;At <br/>the  bottom  of  the  vessel  worms  are  bom.&quot; <br/><br/>The  lower  half  of  the  sixth  bottle  is  of  a  bluish-gray,  the  u  per  half  black,  the  entire  figure  being <br/>termed  &quot;Seventh  Raven's  Head.&quot;  A  child  is  seated  beside  the  bottle,  concerning  whom  it  is  written: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;This  newly-bom,  black  son  is  called  Elixir  and  will  be  made  perfectly  white.&quot;  The  seventh  bottle  is <br/><br/>black  below  and  black  spotted  with  red  above.  The  process  is  thus  described:  &quot;Black  blacker  than <br/>black,  for  many  divers  colors  will  appear.  Those  black  clouds  will  [descend]  to  the  body  whence  they <br/>came,  and  the  junction  of  body,  soul,  and  spirit  has  been  completed  and  turned  to  ashes.&quot; <br/><br/>The  eighth  bottle  is  divided  horizontally  by  a  golden  band,  from  which  rises  a  golden  stem  ending  in <br/>five  leaves  protruding  from  the  neck  of  the  bottle.  The  contents  of  the  vessel  are  transparent,  and  it  is <br/>written  that  &quot;the  black  clouds  are  past  and  the  great  whiteness  has  been  completed.&quot;  The  ninth  bottle <br/>(from  the  neck  of  which  rises  a  golden  white  rose)  is  also  partly  filled  with  a  transparent  liquid.  The <br/>rose  is  made  to  say:  &quot;He  who  blanches  me  makes  me  red.&quot;  The  tenth  and  last  bottle  represents  the <br/>consummation  of  the  Great  Work.  The  lower  half  of  the  vessel  is  filled  with  the  blood-red  Elixir  and <br/>from  the  neck  rises  a  red  rose  with  many  petals  and  of  extreme  beauty.  After  declaring  all  the  planets <br/>to  have  been  present  at  the  consummation  of  the  Great  Work,  the  author  of  the  document  concludes: <br/>&quot;I  gave  to  the  Master  [spirit]  so  much  silver  and  gold  that  be  can  never  be  poor.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  dedication  the  author  and  illustrator  of  the  manuscript  declares  that  he  has  set  forth  all  the <br/>operations  of  the  Great  Work.  He  prays  to  the  Holy  Spirit  that  he  maybe  included  in  the  number  of <br/>those  who  have  pursued  this  most  noble  of  the  sciences  and  that  he  may  be  set  always  in  the  path  of <br/>righteousness.  Exclusive  of  his  own  researches,  the  main  sources  of  his  information  are  said  to  be  the <br/>writings  of  St.  Thomas  Aquinas,  Raymond  Lully,  and  Arnold  of  Villa  Nova. <br/><br/>To  protect  themselves  from  the  persecution  of  despotic  theology  the  medieval  alchemists  couched <br/>their  philosophy  in  Christian  terminology,  although  the  great  secrets  of  the  Art  were  derived  largely <br/>from  Egyptian  or  Arabian  adepts.  The  Mohammedans  were  masters  of  the  Hermetic  secrets  and  even <br/>the  great  Paracelsus  secured  from  them  the  major  part  of  his  knowledge.  In  their  manifestoes  the <br/>Rosicrucians  also  disclose  the  Arabian  source  of  their  secret  doctrine.  Hence  it  should  be  borne  in <br/>mind  that  the  relating  of  the  alchemical  teachings  to  Biblical  symbolism  was  a  gesture  of  expediency. <br/>In  their  search  of  the  Scriptures  for  the  arcana  of  Israel,  the  Qabbalists  substantiated  in  great  measure <br/>the  alchemical  interpretations  of  the  Bible,  for  the  soul  of  alchemy  is  one  with  that  of  Qabbalism.  Both <br/>schools  have  a  common  end,  being  who  concerned  with  the  mystery  of  human  regeneration,  despite <br/>apparent  discrepancies  in  their  symbolism. <br/><br/>The  publication  of  this  manuscript  places  at  the  student's  disposal  the  most  profound  secrets  of  the <br/>Hermetic  Art.  At  first  the  task  of  decipherment  may  seem  hopeless  and  the  superficially-minded  will <br/>be  tempted  to  scoff  at  the  possibility  of  real  knowledge  being  perpetuated  in  such  unconventional <br/>fashion.  The  scoffer  will  not  realize  that  one  of  the  purposes  of  the  document  is  to  awaken  ridicule <br/>and  thus  preserve  more  effectually  its  arcana  from  the  profane.  A  few  sheets  (such  as  those  here <br/>reproduced)  represent  the  life  work  of  one  who  has  consecrated  himself  to  the  task  of  tearing  aside <br/>the  veil  of  the  World  Virgin.  Years  of  research  and  experimentation,  days  of  incessant  labor,  nights  of <br/>prayer  and  meditation,  and  at  last  comes  the  realization  of  accomplishment!  This  is  the  real  story  told <br/>by  the  grotesque  figures  drawn  so  painstakingly  upon  the  faded,  worm-eaten  pages.  Those  who  have <br/>glimpsed  the  greater  realities  of  being  realize  that  the  fundamental  verities  of  life  find  at  best  only <br/>imperfect  expression  through  physical  symbols.  Only  those  who  have  passed  through  the  travail  of <br/>spiritual  birth  can  adequately  comprehend  and  properly  reverence  the  pathetic  efforts  to  portray  for <br/>others  that  knowledge  necessarily  locked  within  the  heart  of  the  one  who  knows. <br/><br/><br/>Leafi.  The  top  line  reads:  &quot;Our  earliest  medicine  was  made  of  natural  objects.&quot;  About  the  king  and <br/>queen  appears  the  statement  that  to  them  a  son  shall  be  born  &quot;in  two  trees  of  the  vine,&quot;  resembling <br/>his  father  and  without  equal  in  all  the  world.  About  the  vase  is  written:  &quot;Green  and  white.&quot;  &quot;The  vase <br/>flame  color,  the  flowers  green.&quot;  &quot;Our  water,  our  silver.&quot;  The  lines  below  read:  &quot;The  material  of  the <br/>Philosopher's  Stone  is  that  thick,  viscous  water,  which  either  heat  or  cold  congeals.  It  is  Mercury <br/>boiled  down  and  thickened,  cooked  in  neutral  earth  with  sulphurous  heat  and  is  called  the  Prime <br/>Material  of  the  metals.  In  caverns  yet  dark,  and  forbidding  mountains,  if  a  Stone  be  found  which  a <br/>thousand  years  ago  Nature  made  out  of  her  fruits,  it  will  bring  him  that  has  it  out  of  trouble.  *  *  * <br/>Listen  carefully  to  all  my  verses;  I  speak  them  without  veil  and  without  deception. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  2.  At  the  top  is  a  quotation  from  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  concerning  the  composition  of  the <br/>Philosopher's  Stone,  which  is  described  as  of  the  purest  transparency;  in  it  all  the  forms  of  the <br/>elements  and  their  contrarieties  were  visible.  Beneath  the  figure  of  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  is  a  short <br/>paragraph  praising  the  excellence  of  the  Philosophic  Stone,  declaring  that  from  the  one  substance  can <br/>be  derived  three  and  from  the  three,  two.  To  the  right  of  St.  Thomas  Aquinas  is  a  likeness  of  Raymond <br/>LuUy  seated  in  the  door  of  his  hermitage.  Under  his  feet  appears  a  quotation  from  this  celebrated <br/>alchemist,  beginning  with  the  question,  &quot;What  is  the  Philosopher's  Stone?&quot;  After  declaring  it  to  be  a <br/>reddish,  fixed  mercury,  Lully  swears  to  the  Almighty  that  he  has  told  the  truth  and  that  it  is  not <br/>permissible  to  say  more.

The  writing  at  the  top  of  the  page  reads:  &quot;Death  of  Saturn;  Hfe  of  Mercury.&quot;  After  describing <br/>the  use  of  the  saturnine  substances,  the  key  to  the  process  is  declared  to  be  depicted  below.  The  verse <br/>reads  &quot;This  [the  stone]  is  made  of  four  elements.  This  is  the  truth  in  all  Nature.  Take  it  in  hand,  bright <br/>and  shining,  with  all  diligence  and  great  care  and  then  try  to  bind  all  securely  together  side  by  side,  so <br/>the  fire  may  cause  alarm.&quot;  Above  the  human  figure  is  written:  &quot;Saturn  is  almost  dead.&quot;  To  the  right  if <br/>the  devouring  serpent  is  a  statement  of  Albertus  Magnus  that  Saturn  and  Mercury  are  the  first <br/>principles  of  the  Stone.  It  also  declares  that  Nature  wisely  provided  a  mixture  of  elements  so  that <br/>earth  can  communicate  its  dryness  to  fire,  fire  its  heat  to  air,  air  its  moisture  to  water,  and  water  its <br/>coldness  to  earth.  (Text  about  the  vase  is  illegible  in  original.) <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  4-  At  the  top:  &quot;Let  them  beheve  that .  everything  is  possible.  The  art  is  fleeting,  bright  and  rare, <br/>and  not  believed  by  the  foolish.&quot;  The  words  between  the  sun  and  crescent  read  &quot;It  is  hidden,&quot;  and  on <br/>the  panel  across  the  body  &quot;The  Book  of  life  and  true  Treasury  of  the  World.&quot;  The  panel  to  the  left  of <br/>the  figure  says  &quot;Moving  almost  all,  and  the  soul  of  its  body  returns  to  the  place  from  which  it  had  fled, <br/>and  ripens  seven  months  or  nine,  and  the  King  crowned  with  his  diadem  appears.&quot;  The  right  panel <br/>states:  &quot;There  are  three  Mercuries:  animal,  vegetable,  and  mineral.&quot;  The  text  below  is  of  such  a  cryptic <br/>nature  that  to  translate  it  is  well  nigh  impossible.  It  declares  that  by  putting  fire  beneath  the  feet  of <br/>the  symbolic  figure  it  is  possible  to  extract  therefrom  the  sun  and  the  moon  which  the  human  body  is <br/>shown  elevating  to  a  position  of  dignity  above  its  head. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  5-  In  the  upper  panel  it  is  declared  that  the  sun-bird  battles  with  the  earth-serpent,  who,  tearing <br/>out  his  own  entrails,  gives  them  to  the  bird.  The  spirit  is  vivified  and  Lazarus  with  joy  is  raised  from <br/>the  dead.  Above  the  bird  is  written:  &quot;This  is  the  sun  in  the  form  of  a  bird,&quot;  and  above  the  dragon  &quot;This <br/>is  the  dragon  devouring  the  bird.  The  first  operation.&quot;  The  panel  of  text  at  the  lower  left  reads  in <br/>substance:  &quot;When  our  sperm  (quicksilver)  is  mixed  with  the  mother  of  elements  (earth),  the  action  is <br/>called  coitus.  The  detention  by  the  earth  of  a  bit  of  quicksilver  is  called  conception.  The  earth  grows <br/>and  multiplies  and  the  operation  is  called  impregnation.  When  earth  is  whitened  with  water  and <br/>made  of  uniform  color  and  appearance,  it  is  called  birth  and  the  King  is  born  out  of  fire.&quot;  The  text  at <br/>lower  right  was  deliberately  mutilated  to  conceal  a  too  evident  secret. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  6.  This  plate  shows  all  the  secrets  of  the  great  Stone.  In  the  center  stands  the  Paschal  Virgin,  in <br/>her  hair  the  prime  virtue  which  is  described  as  an  herb  flourishing  in  wells.  The  hands  hold  the <br/>symbols  of  the  spiritual  and  material  elements.  The  statement  at  the  upper  left  is  to  the  effect  that <br/>there  are  four  spirits  with  two  faces,  which  are  called  the  elements.  At  the  upper  right  it  is  written  that <br/>fire  lives  on  air,  air  on  water,  water  on  earth,  and  thus  the  Stone  lives  Peacefully  on  all  the  pure <br/>elements.  Under  the  sun  appears  the  word  Summer;  under  the  moon.  Autumn.  About  the  tree  on  the <br/>left  with  its  attendant  eyes  are  the  words:  &quot;Turn  away  your  eyes  to  [from?]  the  fire.  There  is  space <br/>[?].&quot;  About  the  tree  to  the  right.  &quot;Open  your  eyes  to  the  fire.  There  is  time.&quot;  The  lower  panel  opens <br/>Mdth  this  sentence  &quot;I  am  exalted  above  the  circles  of  world.&quot; <br/><br/>P-A3 <br/><br/><br/>Leafy.  The  verse  at  the  top  reads:,&quot;  This  Stone  is  so  noble  and  worthy  that  Nature  has  hidden  it  in  her <br/>recesses.  Its  soul  is  all  fair,  and  pure,  for  it  is  the  true  sun.  I  inform  you  of  this.  Keep  it  removed,  apart <br/>and  separated.  Whatever  boon  you  crave,  it  will  come  to  you  bounteously,  without  sin,  with  pleasure <br/>and  delight.&quot;  The  seated  figure  on  the  left  holding  aloft  the  hammer  is  described  as  breaking  hard <br/>stone,  while  the  words  beside  the  man  with  the  retort  read:  &quot;Breaking  of  stone  our  replenishment.&quot; <br/>Between  the  standing  figures  below  is  the  exclamation;  &quot;O  Sages,  seek  and  ye  shall  find  my  Stone!&quot; <br/>Under  the  outstretched  hand  of  the  man  with  a  basket  appear  the  words:  &quot;Draw  out  sorerem  [?]  in <br/>the  bottom.&quot;  Below  the  pool  which  the  man  on  the  left  is  stirring  appears  the  simple  statement:  &quot;Our <br/>healing  water.&quot;  The  faces  of  the  four  men  are  extremely  well  drawn. <br/><br/><br/>Leafs.  Under  the  sun,  moon,  and  Mercury  are  the  words  Three  and  One,  an  inference  that  the  three <br/>are  one.  The  words  under  the  flower  stems  read:  &quot;Whiteness  forty  days  after  ashes.&quot;  Under  the <br/>blossoms  is  written:  (left)  &quot;Minor  time  of  the  Stone&quot;;  (right)  &quot;The  selected  red.&quot;  Between  the  arms  of <br/>the  central  figure  appears:  &quot;Let  one  pound  of  Mercury  be  placed.&quot;  To  the  left  is  written:  &quot;If  you  who <br/>read  shall  have  known  this  figure,  you  will  possess  the  whole  science  of  the  Stone&quot;;  to  the  right:  &quot;And <br/>if  you  do  not  acknowledge  it,  you  will  be  stiff-necked  and  dull.&quot;  Above  the  sun  is  the  word  Father; <br/>above  the  satyr,  &quot;Ferment  of  the  work.&quot;  Beside  the  child  is  the  sentence:  &quot;The  son  of  the  moon  would <br/>threw  the  Stone  into  the  fire&#x2014;his  mother.&quot;  Above  the  flaming  basket  is  written:  &quot;I  am  the  true  Stone.&quot; <br/>Under  the  central  figure  are  the  words:  &quot;A  moderate  fire  is  the  master  of  the  work.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leafg.  In  the  upper  left  it  is  written  that  without  the  hght  of  the  Moon  the  Sun  does  not  heat  the <br/>earth  and  that  into  the  Moon  the  Sun  emits  its  fruits.  In  the  upper  right  the  true  herb  of  the <br/>philosophers  is  described,  and  it  is  declared  that  whoever  believes  in  and  it  shall  be  [spiritually]  rich. <br/>The  panel  concludes  thus:  &quot;Understand  thoroughly  what  it  is  that  the  man  has  in  either  hand  if  you <br/>wish  to  be  enlightened.&quot;  The  text  to  the  left  above  the  sun  reads:  &quot;Entirely  without  the  Sun  and  Moon, <br/>make  dye;  dissolve,  congeal,  and  like  produces  for  itself  like.&quot;  The  words  to  the  right  of  the  man <br/>holding  the  Philosopher's  herb  declare  sublimation  to  be  the  beginning,  the  middle  and  the  end  of  the <br/>Great  Work.  The  last  sentence  reads:  &quot;Out  of  the  Sun  and  Moon  make  a  thing  of  equal  parts,  and  by <br/>their  union,  God  willing,  let  the  Philosopher's  Stone  be  made.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leafio.  The  two  short  hnes  of  text  at  upper  left  read:  &quot;Some  take  a  recent  stone.&quot;  The  hnes  to  the <br/>right  of  the  symbol  of  Mars  (iron)  admonish  the  student  to  control  his  appetites  and  apply  his  mind  to <br/>the  accumulation  of  knowledge.  No  satisfactory  translation  can  be  found  for  the  words  under  the <br/>outstretched  arm  of  the  man  holding  the  upper  part  of  the  tree.  The  lower  panel  reads  thus:  &quot;After  the <br/>Stone  has  been  well  refined  it  will  appear  to  penetrate  thoroughly.  It  should  be  put  into  its  vessel  with <br/>its  water.  Close  it  well  with  a  little  fire,  and  await  the  wonders  of  Nature.&quot;  The  large  red  oval  filling  the <br/>lower  half  of  the  leaf  is  evidently  the  egg  or  vessel  of  the  Sages.  The  tree  is  a  symbol  of  the  growth  of <br/>the  sacred  metals,  for  the  alchemists  affirmed  that  the  metals  are  like  plants  and  grow  in  the  rocks, <br/>spreading  their  branches  (veins)  through  the  interstices. <br/><br/>p.A4 <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  11.  The  fount  is  described  as  that  from  which  the  two  Mercuries  of  the  Philosophers  are  extracted. <br/>At  the  upper  left  is  described  the  white  Mercury  and  at  the  right  the  red  Mercury.  The  text  about  the <br/>fountain  declares  that  Saturn  collects  the  white  Mercury,  which  is  called  the  Water  of  Earth;  and  the <br/>Earth  collects  the  red  Mercury,  which  is  called  the  Water  of  Heaven.  The  text  to  the  left  of  the  frog <br/>reads:  &quot;Through  Him  who  created  the  Heavens  and  the  Earth  I  am  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  and  in  my <br/>body  I  carry  something  the  wise  seek.  If  such  a  charm  be  extracted  from  me,  it  will  be  a  sweet <br/>refreshment  for  you.  I  am  an  animal  having  father  and  mother,  and  father  and  mother  were  created; <br/>and  in  my  body  are  contained  the  four  elements,  and  I  am  before  father  and  mother  and  I  am  a <br/>poisonous  animal.&quot;  The  lines  at  the  right  describe  distilling  and  calcining  processes. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  12.  The  three  words  at  the  top  read:  &quot;This  is  Nature.&quot;  The  Unes  above  the  donkey  read:  &quot;This  is <br/>the  Philosophers'  donkey  who  wished  to  rise  to  the  practice  of  the  Philosopher's  Some.&quot;  The  three <br/>lines  below  the  animal  are  translated:  &quot;Frogs  gather  in  multitudes  but  science  consists  of  clear  water <br/>made  from  the  Sun  and  Moon.&quot;  The  text  under  the  symbolic  bird  is  as  follows:  &quot;This  is  fortune  with <br/>two  wings.  Whosoever  has  it  knows  that  fruit  will  in  such  away  be  produced.  A  great  philosopher  has <br/>shown  that  the  stone  is  a  certain  white  sun,  to  see  which  needs  a  telescope.  To  dissolve  it  in  water <br/>requires  the  Sun  and  Moon,  and  here  one  must  open  200  telescopes,  putting  body  and  soul  in  one <br/>mass.  And  here  is  lost  the  mass;  other  sages  cook  the  frogs  and  add  nothing,  if  the  juice  of  the  Wise <br/>you  wish  to  enjoy.&quot;  To  the  Greeks  the  frog  symbolized  both  metempsychosis  and  earthly  humidity. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  13.  This  Page  contains  but  two  figures.  At  the  left  stands  Morienus,  the  philosopher,  pointing <br/>towards  the  salamander  who  &quot;lives  and  grows  in  fire.&quot;  Morienus,  who  was  born  in  the  twelfth  century, <br/>became  the  disciple  of  the  great  Arabian  alchemist  Adfar,  from  whom  he  learned  the  Hermetic  arts. <br/>Morienus  prepared  the  Philosophical  Elixir  for  the  Sultan  of  Egypt,  inscribing  upon  the  vase  in  which <br/>he  placed  the  precious  substance  the  words:  &quot;He  who  possesses  all  has  no  need  of  others.&quot;  He  spent <br/>many  years  as  a  hermit  near  Jerusalem.  The  lines  below  the  salamander  are:  &quot;Let  the  fire  be  of  a <br/>perfect  red  color;  the  earth  white,  the  water  clear.  Then  compound  them  by  philosophical  means  and <br/>calcine  them  as  many  times  with  the  water  which  the  body  had  as  to  turn  it  white  by  its  kindness. <br/>Having  done  this,  you  will  have  the  greatest  treasure  in  the  world.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  14-  The  three  words  at  the  top  of  the  left  page  are  translated:  &quot;The  man  that  digs.&quot;  Above  the <br/>birds  it  is  declared  that  none  but  the  cocks  of  Hermes,  the  two  Mercuries,  shall  put  hand  to  the  plow, <br/>and  only  after  irrigation  will  the  earth  bring  forth  her  fruits.  The  seated  man  is  Count  Bernard  of <br/>Treviso,  who  says:  &quot;Work  the  earth  with  Mercury.&quot;  (See  chapter  on  Alchemy  and  Its  Exponents.)  The <br/>three  sentences  to  the  Count's  left  read:  &quot;Go  to  the  fire  and  with  Mercury,  thy  brother,  await  me  for  a <br/>month.  Crumble  the  stone  I  gave  thee  and  I  shall  go  to  the  fire.  Thy  death,  my  life.  I  shall  net  die  but, <br/>living,  tell  of  the  works  of  this,  my  master.&quot;  Bernard  of  Treviso  in  his  alchemical  speculation <br/>emphasized  the  necessity  of  meditation  upon  the  philosophical  writings  of  the  great  adepts  rather <br/>than  chemical  experimentation.  He  ultimately  discovered  the  &quot;Stone.&quot; <br/><br/>P-A5 <br/><br/><br/>! <br/><br/><br/>V&quot;&quot;-'  /'^K' <br/>&quot;3'.As  /-iij  &quot;^F^i <br/><br/>Jj.^yj    ^r.-    .'^MmJ    ^4.  ,nr* <br/><br/>yVlLJ.Il../^  .  --J.^ <br/><br/>pj^r*^  fr*F^^     J^n^k       ^&#x00a3;jif- 1 -^***wu <br/><br/><br/>^'-^'''^ <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  15.  The  first  sentence  reads:  &quot;The  fruit  of  plants  by  virtue  of  the  Sun,  our  Stone.&quot;  The  boy  holding <br/>the  dish  is  made  to  say:  &quot;Drink  here  all  ye  that  are  athirst.  Come  unto  me,  run  to  the  waters.  Here <br/>drink,  without  price,  and  drink  your  fill.  Open  your  eyes  and  see  the  wonders  of  the  earth.  They  learn, <br/>my  thirsty  twenty  and  four.&quot;  Beneath  the  boy  are  the  words:  &quot;In  the  beginning  God  created  the <br/>Heavens  and  the  Earth,  and  divided  the  waters  from  the  waters.  Bless  the  waters  which  are  above  the <br/>Heavens.&quot;  The  circle  contains  this  statement:  &quot;The  earth  without  form  and  void.  Out  of  the  stars  come <br/>the  rains.&quot;  The  lower  left  panel  continues  the  alchemical  process,  ending  with  admonition  to <br/>renounce  the  misery  of  worldly  existence.  Above  is  a  prayer  to  the  Virgin  Mary  which  opens  thus: <br/>&quot;Hail  Mary,  full  of  grace,  the  Lord  be  with  thee.  Blessed  thou  among  women.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leafi6.  The  first  sentence  reads:  &quot;The  dead  bodies  remain;  the  spirits  are  freed  by  the  death  in  the <br/>bodies.  You  will  ride  with  that  death  with  a  scjiihe,  and  the  light  of  the  Sun,  the  Moon,  and  the  fixed <br/>stars.&quot;  Over  the  scythe  is  written:  &quot;Subject  to  the  Sun,  the  Moon  and  Azoth,  complete  the  Work.&quot;  The <br/>four  words  in  the  curve  of  the  scythe  blade  say:  &quot;Man's  head,  head  of  raven.&quot;  The  three  lines  to  the <br/>right  are  interpreted  thus:  &quot;This  figure  is  called  Laton,  for  it  looks  black  in  a  vessel,  and  is  the <br/>beginning  of  corruption.&quot;  The  text  below  the  ladder  states:  &quot;This  is  the  ladder  of  primitive  matter <br/>which  when  placed  in  a  vessel  turns  black,  the  gradually  changes  to  white  by  the  scale  [ladder]  of <br/>digestion,  according  to  the  degree  of  heat.&quot;  Here  a  ladder  is  used  to  signify  the  natural  steps  up  which <br/>matter  must  ascend  before  it  can  attain  to  a  truly  spiritual  state. <br/><br/><br/>Leafiy.  The  verse  at  the  top  of  the  page  reads:  &quot;Not  only  must  this  material  be  fixed,  but  it  must  be <br/>allowed  to  enter  into  everything  so  that  this  material  may  be  well  completed  and  have  infinite  virtue. <br/>Then  by  making  it  thick,  it  becomes  at  once  all  white,  sublimation  from  white  it  becomes  shining.&quot; <br/>Above  the  sun  are  the  words:  &quot;God  and  Nature  do  nothing  in  vain.&quot;  The  man  on  the  left  is  a  mediaeval <br/>conception  of  Hermes,  the  great  Egyptian  philosopher;  the  one  on  the  right  is  Christopher,  the <br/>philosopher  of  Paris.  Above  the  latter  is  written:  &quot;If  the  Stone  is  black,  it  is  not  useless.&quot;  The  words <br/>over  the  retort  are:  &quot;There  is  air,  fire,  water,  and  earth.&quot;  Below  is  added:  &quot;A  dissolution  of  the  body  is <br/>the  first  step.  &quot;  The  curious  chemical  apparatus  must  be  considered  purely  symbolic  in  this  work  and, <br/>as  its  author  himself  says,  is  intended  to  give  only  a  hint  of  the  &quot;Art.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Iff <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  18.  At  the  left  holding  a  book  stands  Aristotle,  who  is  described  as  the  most  learned  of  all  the <br/>Greeks.  The  tree  surmounted  by  the  Sun  and  Mon.  is  accompanied  by  the  wards:  &quot;When  the  Stone  is <br/>dead,  that  is  changed  to  water,  in  this  it  will  produce  flowers.&quot;  Beneath  Aristotle  and  the  prostrate <br/>human  figure  from  which  rises  the  flowering  tree  are  these  statements:  &quot;He  who  makes  everything <br/>descend  from  heaven  to  earth,  and  then  ascend  from  earth  to  heaven,  has  information  about  the <br/>Stone.  For  in  Mercury  there  is  something  the  wise  seek,  not  invoked  except  by  white  or  red  ferment.&quot; <br/>The  first  part  of  this  quotation  is  based  upon  the  Emerald  Tablet  of  Hermes  (which  see).  In  ordinary <br/>man,  the  spirit  is  figuratively  absorbed  by  the  body;  but  in  the  true  philosopher,  the  spirit  is  so  greatly <br/>increased  in  power  that  it  absorbs  into  itself  and  is  nourished  by  man's  corporeal  body. <br/><br/>p.A6 <br/><br/><br/>Leafig.  At  the  top  it  reads:  &quot;He  that  comes  to  know  this  figure  will  have  knowledge  of  the  Stone.&quot;  The <br/>seated  man  probably  represents  Paracelsus.  To  his  right  are  the  words:  &quot;I  am  neither  tree  nor  animal, <br/>nor  stone  nor  vegetable,  but  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  trampled  on  by  men,  cast  into  the  fire  by  my <br/>father,  and  in  fire  I  rejoice.&quot;  The  four  words  to  the  left  say  &quot;In  dryness  is  the  Stone.&quot;  Below  the  man  is <br/>the  Philosophic  Egg  containing  the  words:  &quot;It  is  the  end  in  which  the  beginning  rests.&quot;  The  capital  T <br/>stands  for  &quot;Tincture.&quot;  The  text  to  the  right  states:  &quot;In  Stone  it  is  formed,  as  Gerber  writes  in  his  book <br/>very  learnedly,  and  possessing  so  much  of  its  nature  that  it  changes  into  clear,  living  water;  and  it  has <br/>the  power  to  make  folks  rich,  satisfied,  and  free  from  all  cares,  so  they  will  be  always  happy  if  they <br/>attain  by  their  wit  to  the  secret.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leaf20.  At  the  top  is  written:  &quot;Rains  are  made  by  six  stars.&quot;  Under  the  inverted  man  it  reads: <br/>&quot;Receive  new  spirit.  Arise,  for  you  are  asleep.&quot;  The  two  sentences  about  the  large  figure  read: <br/>&quot;Remember  Mercury,  for  ashes  thou  art  and  unto  ashes  thou  shalt  return.  I  thirst  and  am  dead.&quot; <br/>Above  the  seven  globes  at  the  left  is  the  admonition:  &quot;If  he  thirst,  give  him  a  drink  and  he  shall  live.&quot; <br/>Over  the  small  man  is  written:  &quot;Hermes,  the  father  of  philosophers.&quot;  The  curved  line  of  writing  to <br/>which  Hermes  points  says:  &quot;The  measure  of  the  drink.&quot;  Under  the  central  pedestal  appears:  &quot;The  light <br/>of  my  eyes  is  a  lantern  to  my  feet.&quot;  Below  is  added:  &quot;If  the  beginning  is  unknown,  the  rest  is <br/>unknown.&quot;  Above  the  figure  rising  from  the  flames  on  the  right  is  the  statement:  &quot;He  was  resurrected <br/>after  new  Moon,&quot;  and  under  the  eagle:  &quot;Thou  shalt  not  fly  further  with  me.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  21.  The  upper  line  reads:  &quot;Two  things  and  double,  but  finally  one  is  dissolved  into  the  first  and <br/>they  make  sperm.&quot;  The  four  capitals.  lAA  T,  are  the  initial  letters  of  the  names  of  the  elements:  Ignis, <br/>Aer,  Aqua,  and  Terra.  The  writing  under  them  reads:  &quot;Our  fire  is  water;  if  you  can  give  fire  to  fire,  fire <br/>and  Mercury  will  suffice.&quot;  Along  the  arm  appear  the  words:  &quot;The  Art  of  the  Stone  is,&quot;  and  on  the <br/>ribbon:  &quot;Swift,  brief,  bright,  and  rare.&quot;  The  two  lines  under  the  ribbon  read:  &quot;Every  hand  is  a  key, <br/>because  it  was  called  the  herb  celandine&quot;;  under  the  Sun:  &quot;I  am  the  gift  of  God  &quot;  The  verse  reads:  &quot;So <br/>that  you  remain  contented  in  all  matters,  I  must  listen  attentively.  My  body  [is]  naked,  clean,  and <br/>shining,  and  I  run  like  oil  ready  to  drop,  resplendent  like  bright  gold,  and  then  succumb  to  the  plague <br/>in  its  bright  and  cheerful  little  chamber  [retort].&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  22.  The  verse  in  the  upper  left  is  as  fohows:  &quot;This  group  is  composed  of  three  stones:  lunar,  solar, <br/>and  mercurial.  In  the  lunar  is  white  sulphur;  in  the  solar,  red  sulphur,  in  the  mercurial,  both;  i.e. <br/>white  and  red,  and  this  is  the  strength  of  all  instruction.&quot;  In  the  bottle  at  the  left  are  the  words: <br/>&quot;Dissolving,  calcination,  sublimation  complete  the  instruction&quot;;  and  at  the  base:  &quot;Wash,  congeal,  and <br/>coagulate. &quot;  Under  the  central  tower  is  written:  &quot;Metallic  salts,  however,  are  hidden  by  one  letter&quot;; <br/>around  the  bottom  of  the  red  circle:  &quot;Dryness,  coldness,  humidity,  heat,  and  dryness.&quot;  On  the  points <br/>below  are  the  names  of  the  four  elements.  The  initial,  I A  A  T  appear  four  times  with  the  same <br/>meaning  as  that  already  given.  The  three  powers  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone  are  symbolized  by  the <br/>heads  of  the  cherubs  in  the  circle  in  the  upper  left  corner. <br/><br/>p.

The  writing  at  the  upper  left  is,  in  substance,  the  Lord's  Prayer,  with  the  addition  of  the <br/>words  Jesus  and  Mary  at  the  end.  The  inverted  words  in  the  banner  read:  &quot;Ye  can  do  nothing  without <br/>me,  for  God  has  so  promised,  saying  'So  be  it.'&quot;  The  text  under  the  angel  reads:  &quot;By  this  plague  he  will <br/>be  damned  who  knows  he  is  dead,  all  cold  in  a  black  body.  And  let  this  be  thy  first  comfort:  then  he <br/>will  burn  unto  calcination.  When  I  have  reduced  him  within  this  door,  know  for  certain  that  I  shall  be <br/>blessed  if  I  shall  know  how  to  cultivate  the  garden.&quot;  The  main  part  of  the  leaf  is  devoted  to  an <br/>elaborate  symbolic  drawing  of  alchemical  equipment,  under  which  are  the  words:  &quot;The  furnace  of <br/>distillation,  congealing,  rectification,  perfection,  fixation:  quintessence  of  the  Philosophers.&quot;  By <br/>&quot;quintessence&quot;  should  be  understood  the  &quot;fifth  essence&quot;  of  the  most  wise. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  24.  The  words  at  the  top  read:  &quot;I,  the  bird  [the  adept],  speak  into  thine  ears  from  the  Sun,  Moon <br/>and  Azoth.  The  work  is  perfected  with  little  labor.&quot;  The  panel  to  the  left  describes  the  nature  of <br/>primordial  matter  and  the  drink  of  the  Philosophers.  The  text  to  the  right  reads:  &quot;This  is  my  beloved <br/>Son  whom  I  saw  and  loved.  If  he  be  resurrected,  He  will  remain  at  home,  and  in  that  house  the  spirit <br/>will  be  the  soul  and  the  body;  for  Mercury  may  be  called  the  son  of  the  Sun  and  the  Moon.&quot;  Under  the <br/>child's  figure  is  added:  &quot;If  he  were  not  dead,  I  should  not  have  been  his  mother.  I  bore  him  after  death <br/>before  he  was  born  in  the  world;  under  my  feet  I  have  what  was  his,  and  out  of  me  and  my  Son  and <br/>the  foundation  of  my  feet  the  Philosopher's  Stone  is  made.&quot;  At  the  lower  left  the  three  constituents  of <br/>the  Stone  are  shown  elevated  upon  a  pedestal  to  signify  their  dignity. <br/><br/><br/>1/ <br/><br/><br/>1^ AiH.

Above  the  figure  of  the  Queen  are  three  hues  stating,  in  substance,  that  in  the  beginning  of <br/>the  book  it  was  written  of  her  that  from  her  maternal  breasts  she  nourished  the  Sun,  and  that  he  who <br/>was  capable  of  converting  her  into  Primal  matter  possessed  rare  skill.  Opposite  the  Queen's  head  are <br/>the  words:  &quot;In  the  highest  mountains  this  water&quot;  and  &quot;I  am  the  light  of  the  Philosophers.&quot;  To  the  left <br/>of  the  Queen  is  an  admonition  to  strike  the  sons  whom  she  bears.  She  calls  herself  &quot;The  mother  of  the <br/>Sun,  the  sister  of  the  Moon,  and  the  servant  and  spouse  of  Mercury.&quot;  On  the  right  she  is  made  to <br/>exclaim:  &quot;I  cannot  be  crowned  unless  these  sons  of  mine  become  ashes. &quot;  The  sons  are  shown  directly <br/>below.  The  verse  under  the  Queen  continues  the  alchemical  processes,  describing  the  method  in <br/>which  the  exudations  from  the  substance  should  be  preserved. <br/><br/><br/>Leaf  26.  This  page,  which  concludes  that  part  of  the  Hermetic  manuscript  bearing  the  symbols  of  the <br/>Secret  Work,  contains  a  number  of  emblems  not  directly  correlated.  At  the  top  is  the  head  of  the <br/>King&#x2014;the  most  common  of  alchemical  figures.  To  the  right  of  the  King  is  an  alchemical  vessel <br/>designated  the  Hermetic  Seal.  Below  is  the  head  of  a  ferocious  bird,  here  designated  a  griffon.  To  the <br/>left  of  the  King  is  a  headless  figure  elevating  a  Sun,  or  spiritual  face.  This  figure  is  the  world,  which <br/>must  be  headless,  since  its  spiritual  and  rational  part  is  not  material  and  consequently,  is  invisible. <br/>Below  is  a  circle  unaccompanied  by  descriptive  matter.  Directly  under  the  King's  head  is  a  vase  of <br/>flowers,  in  which  rises  the  golden  plant  of  the  Philosophers.  At  the  bottom  of  the  page  is  additional <br/>alchemical  equipment,  this  also  being  termed  a  Hermetic  Seal. <br/><br/><br/>p.  161 <br/><br/><br/>The  Chemical  Marriage <br/><br/>THE  self-admitted  author  of  The  Chemical  Marriage,  Johann  Valentin  Andrese,  born  in <br/>Wiirttemberg  in  1586,  was  twenty-eight  years  of  age  when  that  work  was  first  published.  It  was <br/>presumably  written  about  twelve  years  prior  to  its  publication&#x2014;or  when  the  author  was  fifteen  or <br/>sixteen  years  old.  The  fact  is  almost  incredible  that  one  so  young  could  produce  a  volume  containing <br/>the  wealth  of  symbolic  thought  and  philosophy  hidden  between  the  lines  of  The  Chemical  Marriage. <br/>This  book  makes  the  earliest  known  reference  to  Christian  Rosencreutz,  and  is  generally  regarded  as <br/>the  third  of  the  series  of  original  Rosicrucian  manifestoes.  As  a  symbolic  work,  the  book  itself  is <br/>hopelessly  irreconcilable  with  the  statements  made  by  Andreae  concerning  it.  The  story  of  The <br/>Chemical  Marriage  relates  in  detail  a  series  of  incidents  occurring  to  an  aged  man,  presumably  the <br/>Father  C.R.C.  of  the  Fama  and  Confessio.  If  Father  C.R.C.  was  born  in  1378,  as  stated  in  the  Confessio, <br/>and  is  identical  with  the  Christian  Rosencreutz  of  The  Chemical  Marriage,  he  was  elevated  to  the <br/>dignity  of  a  Knight  of  the  Golden  Stone  in  the  eighty-first  year  of  his  life  (1459).  In  the  light  of  his  own <br/>statements,  it  is  inconceivable  that  Andreae  could  have  been  Father  Rosy  Cross. <br/><br/>Many  figures  found  in  the  various  books  on  symbolism  published  in  the  early  part  of  the  seventeenth <br/>century  bear  a  striking  resemblance  to  the  characters  and  episodes  in  The  Chemical  Marriage.  The <br/>alchemical  wedding  may  prove  to  be  the  key  to  the  riddle  of  Baconian  Rosicrucianism.  The  presence <br/>in  the  German  text  of  The  Chemical  Marriage  of  some  words  in  English  indicates  its  author  to  have <br/>been  conversant  also  with  that  language.  The  following  summary  of  the  main  episodes  of  the  seven <br/>days  of  The  Chemical  Marriage  will  give  the  reader  a  fairly  comprehensive  idea  of  the  profundity  of <br/>its  symbolism. <br/><br/>THE  FIRST  DAY <br/><br/>Christian  Rosencreutz,  having  prepared  in  his  heart  the  Paschal  Lamb  together  with  a  small <br/>unleavened  loaf,  was  disturbed  while  at  prayer  one  evening  before  Easter  by  a  violent  storm  which <br/>threatened  to  demolish  not  only  his  little  house  but  the  very  hill  on  which  it  stood.  In  the  midst  of  the <br/>tempest  he  was  touched  on  the  back  and,  turning,  he  beheld  a  glorious  woman  with  wings  filled  with <br/>eyes,  and  robed  in  sky-colored  garments  spangled  with  stars.  In  one  hand  she  held  a  trumpet  and  in <br/>the  other  a  bundle  of  letters  in  every  language.  Handing  a  letter  to  C.R.C,  she  immediately  ascended <br/>into  the  air,  at  the  same  time  blowing  upon  her  trumpet  a  blast  which  shook  the  house.  Upon  the  seal <br/>of  the  letter  was  a  curious  cross  and  the  words  In  hoc  signo  vinces.  Within,  traced  in  letters  of  gold  on <br/>an  azure  field,  was  an  invitation  to  a  royal  wedding. <br/><br/>C.R.C.  was  deeply  moved  by  the  invitation  because  it  was  the  fulfillment  of  a  prophecy  which  he  had <br/>received  seven  years  before,  but  so  unworthy  did  he  feel  that  he  was  paralyzed  with  fear.  At  length, <br/>after  resorting  to  prayer,  he  sought  sleep.  In  his  dreams  he  found  himself  in  a  loathsome  dungeon <br/>with  a  multitude  of  other  men,  all  bound  and  fettered  with  great  chains.  The  grievousness  of  their <br/>sufferings  was  increased  as  they  stumbled  over  each  other  in  the  darkness.  Suddenly  from  above <br/>came  the  sound  of  trumpets;  the  cover  of  the  dungeon  was  lifted,  and  a  ray  of  light  pierced  the  gloom. <br/>Framed  in  the  light  stood  a  hoary-headed  man  who  announced  that  a  rope  would  be  lowered  seven <br/>times  and  whoever  could  cling  to  the  rope  would  be  drawn  up  to  freedom. <br/><br/>Great  confusion  ensued.  All  sought  to  grasp  the  rope  and  many  were  pulled  away  from  it  by  others. <br/>C.R.C.  despaired  of  being  saved,  but  suddenly  the  rope  swung  towards  him  and,  grasping  it,  he  was <br/>raised  from  the  dungeon.  An  aged  woman  called  the  &quot;Ancient  Matron&quot;  wrote  in  a  golden  yellow  book <br/>the  names  of  those  drawn  forth,  and  each  of  the  redeemed  was  given  for  remembrance  a  piece  of  gold <br/>bearing  the  symbol  of  the  sun  and  the  letters  DLS.  C.R.C.,  who  had  been  injured  while  clinging  to  the <br/><br/><br/>rope,  found  it  difficult  to  walk.  The  aged  woman  bade  him  not  to  worry,  but  to  thank  God  who  had <br/><br/>permitted  him  to  come  into  so  high  a  light.  Thereupon  trumpets  sounded  and  C.R.C.  awoke,  but  so <br/>vivid  was  the  dream  that  he  was  still  sensible  of  the  wounds  received  while  asleep. <br/><br/>With  renewed  faith  C.  R.  C.  arose  and  prepared  himself  for  the  Hermetic  Marriage.  He  donned  a <br/>white  linen  coat  and  bound  a  red  ribbon  crosswise  over  his  shoulders.  In  his  hat  he  stuck  four  roses <br/>and  for  food  he  carried  bread,  water,  and  salt.  Before  leaving  his  cottage,  he  knelt  and  vowed  that <br/>whatever  knowledge  was  revealed  to  him  he  would  devote  to  the  service  of  his  neighbor.  He  then <br/>departed  from  his  house  with  joy. <br/><br/>THE  SECOND  DAY <br/><br/>As  he  entered  the  forest  surrounding  his  little  house,  it  seemed  to  C.R.C.  that  all  Nature  had  joyously <br/>prepared  for  the  wedding.  As  he  proceeded  singing  merrily,  he  came  to  a  green  heath  in  which  stood <br/>three  great  cedars,  one  bearing  a  tablet  with  an  inscription  describing  the  four  paths  that  led  to  the <br/>palace  of  the  King:  the  first  short  and  dangerous,  the  second  circuitous,  the  third  a  pleasant  and  royal <br/>road,  and  the  fourth  suitable  only  for  incorruptible  bodies.  Weary  and  perplexed,  C.R.C.  decided  to <br/>rest  and,  cutting  a  slice  of  bread,  was  about  to  partake  thereof  when  a  white  dove  begged  it  from  him. <br/>The  dove  was  at  once  attacked  by  a  raven,  and  in  his  efforts  to  separate  the  birds  C.R.C.  unknowingly <br/>ran  a  considerable  distance  along  one  of  the  four  paths&#x2014;that  leading  southward.  A  terrific  wind <br/>preventing  him  from  retracing  his  steps,  the  wedding  guest  resigned  himself  to  the  loss  of  his  bread <br/>and  continued  along  the  road  until  he  espied  in  the  distance  a  great  gate.  The  sun  being  low,  he <br/>hastened  towards  the  portal,  upon  which,  among  other  figures,  was  a  tablet  bearing  the  words  Procul <br/>hincprocul  iteprofani. <br/><br/>A  gatekeeper  in  sky-colored  habit  immediately  asked  C.R.C.  for  his  letter  of  invitation  and,  on <br/>receiving  it,  bade  him  enter  and  requested  that  he  purchase  a  token.  After  describing  himself  as  a <br/>Brother  of  the  Red  Rosie  Cross,  C.R.C.  received  in  exchange  for  his  water  bottle  a  golden  disk  bearing <br/>the  letters  S  C.  Night  drawing  near,  the  wanderer  hastened  on  to  a  second  gate,  guarded  by  a  lion,  and <br/>to  which  was  affixed  a  tablet  with  the  words  Date  et  dabitur  volis,  where  he  presented  a  letter  given <br/>him  by  the  first  gatekeeper.  Being  urged  to  purchase  a  token  bearing  the  letters  SM,  he  gave  his  little <br/>package  of  salt  and  then  hastened  on  to  reach  the  palace  gates  before  they  were  locked  for  the  night. <br/><br/>A  beautiful  virgin  called  Virgo  Lucifera  was  extinguishing  the  castle  lights  as  C.R.C.  approached,  and <br/>he  was  barely  able  to  squeeze  through  the  closing  gates.  As  they  closed  they  caught  part  of  his  coat, <br/>which  he  was  forced  to  leave  behind.  Here  his  name  was  written  in  the  Lord  Bridegroom's  little <br/>vellum  book  and  he  was  presented  with  a  new  pair  of  shoes  and  also  a  token  bearing  the  letters  SPN. <br/>He  was  then  conducted  by  pages  to  a  small  chamber  where  the  &quot;ice-grey  locks&quot;  were  cut  from  the <br/>crown  of  his  head  by  invisible  barbers,  after  which  he  was  ushered  into  a  spacious  hall  where  a  goodly <br/>number  of  kings,  princes,  and  commoners  were  assembled.  At  the  sound  of  trumpets  each  seated <br/>himself  at  the  table,  taking  a  position  corresponding  to  his  dignity,  so  that  C.R.C.  received  a  very <br/>humble  seat.  Most  of  the  pseudo-philosophers  present  being  vain  pretenders,  the  banquet  became  an <br/>orgy,  which,  however,  suddenly  ceased  at  the  sound  of <br/><br/><br/>Ar&#x20ac;4napuhliC4tavilefcmt  -, <br/><br/>'Ergo :  JteMarfaniaioh^ce^orctfJet^ <br/>z^Jtno fuhfirne  rojkt. <br/><br/><br/>Anna  M  DCZVL <br/><br/>TITLE  PAGE  OF  1616  EDITION  OF  CHYMISCHE  HOCHZEIT:  CHRISTIAN  ROSENCREUTZ. <br/><br/>From  Rosencreutz'  Chemical  Marriage. <br/><br/>The  most  remarkable  of  all  the  publications  involved  in  the  Rosicrucian  controversy  is  that  of  The  Chemical  Marriage, <br/>published  in  Strasbourg.  This  work,  which  is  very  rare,  should  be  reproduced  in  exact  facsimile  to  provide  students  with <br/>the  opportunity  of  examining  the  actual  text  for  the  various  forms  of  cipher  employed.  Probably  no  other  volume  in  the <br/>history  or  literature  created  such  a  profound  disturbance  as  this  unpretentious  little  book.  Immediately  following  its <br/>publication  the  purpose  for  which  the  volume  was  intended  became  the  subject  of  popular  speculation.  It  was  both <br/>attacked  and  defended  by  theologians  and  philosophers  alike,  but  when  the  various  contending  elements  are  simmered <br/>down  the  mysteries  surrounding  the  book  remain  unsolved.  That  its  author  was  a  man  of  exceptional  learning  was <br/>admitted,  and  it  is  noteworthy  that  those  minds  which  possessed  the  deepest  understanding  of  Nature's  mysteries  were <br/>among  those  profoundly  impressed  by  the  contents  of  The  Chemical  Marriage. <br/><br/>p.  162 <br/><br/>Stately  and  inspired  music.  For  nearly  half  an  hour  no  one  spoke.  Then  amidst  a  great  sound  the  door <br/>of  the  dining  hall  swung  open  and  thousands  of  lighted  tapers  held  by  invisible  hands  entered.  These <br/>were  followed  by  the  two  pages  lighting  the  beautiful  Virgo  Lucifera  seated  on  a  self-moving  throne. <br/>The  white-and-gold-robed  Virgin  then  rose  and  announced  that  to  prevent  the  admission  of  unworthy <br/>persons  to  the  mystical  wedding  a  set  of  scales  would  be  erected  the  following  day  upon  which  each <br/>guest  would  be  weighed  to  determine  his  integrity.  Those  unwilling  to  undergo  this  ordeal  she  stated <br/>should  remain  in  the  dining  hall.  She  then  withdrew,  but  many  of  the  tapers  stayed  to  accompany  the <br/>guests  to  their  quarters  for  the  night. <br/><br/>Most  of  those  present  were  presumptuous  enough  to  believe  that  they  could  be  safety  weighed,  but <br/>nine&#x2014;including  C.R.C.~felt  their  shortcomings  so  deeply  that  they  feared  the  outcome  and  remained <br/>in  the  hall  while  the  others  were  led  away  to  their  sleeping  chambers.  These  nine  were  bound  with <br/><br/><br/>ropes  and  left  alone  in  darkness.  C.R.C.  then  dreamed  that  he  saw  many  men  suspended  over  the <br/><br/>earth  by  threads,  and  among  them  flew  an  aged  man  who,  cutting  here  and  there  a  thread,  caused <br/>many  to  fall  to  earth.  Those  who  in  arrogance  had  soared  to  lofty  heights  accordingly  fell  a  greater <br/>distance  and  sustained  more  serious  injury  than  the  more  humble  ones  who,  falling  but  a  short <br/>distance,  often  landed  without  mishap.  Considering  this  dream  to  be  a  good  omen,  C.R.C.  related  it  to <br/>a  companion,  continuing  in  discourse  with  him  until  dawn. <br/><br/>THE  THIRD  DAY <br/><br/>Soon  after  dawn  the  trumpets  sounded  and  the  Virgo  Lucifera,  arrayed  in  red  velvet,  girded  with  a <br/>white  sash,  and  crowned  with  a  laurel  wreath,  entered  accompanied  by  two  hundred  men  in  red-and- <br/>white  livery.  She  intimated  to  C.R.C.  and  his  eight  companions  that  they  might  fare  better  than  the <br/>other,  self-satisfied  guests.  Golden  scales  were  then  hung  in  the  midst  of  the  hall  and  near  them  were <br/>placed  seven  weights,  one  good-sized,  four  small,  and  two  very  large.  The  men  in  livery,  each  carrying <br/>a  naked  sword  and  a  strong  rope,  were  divided  into  seven  groups  and  from  each  group  was  chosen  a <br/>captain,  who  was  given  charge  of  one  of  the  weights.  Having  remounted  her  high  throne,  Virgo <br/>Lucifera  ordered  the  ceremony  to  begin.  The  first  to  step  on  the  scales  was  an  emperor  so  virtuous <br/>that  the  balances  did  not  tip  until  six  weights  had  been  placed  upon  the  opposite  end.  He  was <br/>therefore  turned  over  to  the  sixth  group.  The  rich  and  poor  alike  stood  upon  the  scales,  but  only  a  few <br/>passed  the  test  successfully.  To  these  were  given  velvet  robes  and  wreaths  of  laurel,  after  which  they <br/>were  seated  upon  the  steps  of  Virgo  Lucif era's  throne.  Those  who  failed  were  ridiculed  and  scourged. <br/><br/>The  &quot;inquisition&quot;  being  finished,  one  of  the  captains  begged  Virgo  Lucifera  to  permit  the  nine  men <br/>who  had  declared  themselves  unworthy  also  to  be  weighed,  and  this  caused  C.R.C.  anguish  and  fear. <br/>Of  the  first  seven  one  succeeded  and  was  greeted  with  joy.  C.R.C.  was  the  eighth  and  he  not  only <br/>withstood  all  the  weights  but  even  when  three  men  hung  on  the  opposite  end  of  the  beam  he  could <br/>not  be  moved.  A  page  cried  out:  &quot;THAT  IS  HE!&quot;  C.R.C.  was  quickly  set  at  liberty  and  permitted  to <br/>release  one  of  the  captives.  He  chose  the  first  emperor.  Virgo  Lucifera  then  requested  the  red  roses <br/>that  C.R.C.  carried,  which  he  immediately  gave  her.  The  ceremony  of  the  scales  ended  about  ten <br/>o'clock  in  the  forenoon. <br/><br/>After  agreeing  upon  the  penalties  to  be  imposed  upon  those  whose  shortcomings  had  been  thus <br/>exposed,  a  dinner  was  served  to  all.  The  few  successful  &quot;artists,&quot;  including  C.R.C.,  were  given  the  chief <br/>seats,  after  which  the  Golden  Fleece  and  a  Flying  Lion  were  bestowed  upon  them  in  the  name  of  the <br/>Bridegroom.  Virgo  Lucifera  then  presented  a  magnificent  goblet  to  the  guests,  stating  that  the  King <br/>had  requested  all  to  share  its  contents,  Following  this,  C.R.C.  and  his  companions  were  taken  out <br/>upon  a  scaffolding  where  they  beheld  the  various  penalties  suffered  by  those  who  failed.  Before <br/>leaving  the  palace,  each  of  the  rejected  guests  was  given  a  draught  of  forgetfulness.  The  elect  then <br/>returned  to  the  castle,  where  to  each  was  assigned  a  learned  page,  who  conducted  them  through  the <br/>various  parts  of  the  edifice.  C.R.C.  saw  many  things  his  companions  were  not  privileged  to  behold, <br/>including  the  Royal  Sepulcher,  where  he  learned  &quot;more  than  is  extant  in  all  books.&quot;  He  also  visited  a <br/>magnificent  library  and  an  observatory  containing  a  great  globe  thirty  feet  in  diameter  and  with  all <br/>the  countries  of  the  world  marked  upon  it. <br/><br/>At  supper  the  various  guests  propounded  enigmas  and  C.R.C.  solved  the  riddle  which  Virgo  Lucifera <br/>asked  concerning  her  own  identity.  Then  entered  the  dining  hall  two  youths  and  six  virgins <br/>beautifully  robed,  followed  by  a  seventh  virgin  wearing  a  coronet.  The  latter  was  called  the  Duchess, <br/>and  was  mistaken  for  the  Hermetic  Bride.  The  Duchess  told  C.R.C.  that  he  had  received  more  than <br/>the  others,  therefore  should  make  a  greater  return.  The  Duchess  then  asked  each  of  the  virgins  to  pick <br/>up  one  of  the  seven  weights  which  still  remained  in  the  great  room.  To  Virgo  Lucifera  was  given  the <br/>heaviest  weight,  which  was  hung  in  the  Queen's  chamber  during  the  singing  of  a  hymn.  In  the  second <br/>chamber  the  first  virgin  hung  her  weight  during  a  similar  ceremony;  thus  they  proceeded  from  room <br/>to  room  until  the  weights  had  been  disposed  of.  The  Duchess  then  presented  her  hand  to  C.  R.  C.  and <br/><br/><br/>his  companions  and,  followed  by  her  virgins,  withdrew.  Pages  then  conducted  the  guests  to  their <br/>sleeping  chambers.  The  one  assigned  to  C.R.C.  was  hung  with  rare  tapestries  and  with  beautiful <br/>paintings. <br/><br/>THE  FOURTH  DAY <br/><br/>After  washing  and  drinking  in  the  garden  from  a  fountain  which  bore  several  inscriptions&#x2014;among <br/>them  one  reading,  &quot;Drink,  brothers,  and  live&quot;~the  guests,  led  by  Virgo  Lucifera,  ascended  the  365 <br/>steps  of  the  royal  winding  stairs.  The  guests  were  given  wreaths  of  laurel  and,  a  curtain  being  raised, <br/>found  themselves  in  the  presence  of  the  King  and  Queen.  C.R.C.  was  awestruck  by  the  glory  of  the <br/>throne  room  and  especially  by  the  magnificence  of  the  Queen's  robes,  which  were  so  dazzling  that  he <br/>could  not  gaze  upon  them.  Each  guest  was  presented  to  the  King  by  one  of  the  virgins  and  after  this <br/>ceremony  the  Virgo  Lucifera  made  a  short  speech  in  which  she  recited  the  achievements  of  the <br/>honest  &quot;artists&quot;  and  begged  that  each  be  questioned  as  to  whether  she  had  properly  fulfilled  her  duty. <br/>Old  Atlas  then  stepped  forward  and  in  the  name  of  their  Royal  Majesties  greeted  the  intrepid  band  of <br/>philosophers  and  assured  Virgo  Lucifera  that  she  should  receive  a  royal  reward. <br/><br/>The  length  of  the  throne  room  was  five  times  its  width.  To  the  west  was  a  great  porch  in  which  stood <br/><br/>three  thrones,  the  central  one  elevated.  On  each  throne  sat  two  persons:  on  the  first  an  ancient  king <br/>with  a  young  consort;  on  the  third  a  black  king  with  a  veiled  matron  beside  him;  and  on  the  central <br/>throne  two  young  persons  over  whose  heads  hung  a  large  and  costly  crown,  about  which  hovered  a <br/>little  Cupid  who  shot  his  arrows  first  at  the  two  lovers  and  then  about  the  hall.  Before  the  Queen  a <br/>book  bound  in  black  velvet  lay  on  a  small  altar,  on  which  were  golden  decorations.  Beside  this  were  a <br/>burning  candle,  a  celestial  globe,  a  small  striking-watch,  a  little  crystal  pipe  from  which  ran  a  stream <br/>of  clear  blood-red  liquor,  and  a  skull  with  a  white  serpent  crawling  in  and  out  of  the  orbits.  After  their <br/>presentations,  the  guests  retired  down  the  winding  stairs  to  the  great  hall. <br/><br/><br/>Here  foIlow^tK  the^isftK  conwynm^  aH <br/><br/><br/>nay  nftrrn^f <br/><br/>'Ji n*it  nrJttitiitit-  jarjatf <br/><br/><br/>KEY  TO  THE  GREAT  PHILOSOPHICAL  SECRET. <br/><br/><br/>From  Ashmole's  Theatrum  Chemicum  Britannicum. <br/><br/><br/>This  plate,  which  is  the  key  to  mystic  Christian  alchemy,  is  missing  from  almost  every  copy  of  the  Theatrum  Chemicum <br/>Britannicum,  a  work  compiled  by  Elias  Ashmole  and  containing  about  a  score  of  pieces  by  English  poets  treating  of  the <br/>Philosopher's  Stone  and  the  Hermetic  mysteries.  In  view  of  the  consistent  manner  in  which  the  plate  disappeared,  it  is <br/>possible  that  the  diagram  was  purposely  removed  because  it  revealed  too  plainly  the  Rosicrucian  arcana.  Worthy  of  notice <br/>also  is  the  care  with  which  owners'  names  have  been  effaced  from  early  books  pertaining  to  alchemy  and  Hermeticism. <br/>The  original  names  are  usually  rendered  illegible  being  covered  with  heavy  ink  lines,  the  procedure  often  seriously <br/>defacing  the  volume.  While  an  occasional  exception  is  found,  in  practically  every  instance  the  mutilated  books  either  deal <br/>with  Rosicrucianism  or  contain  cryptic  writings  of  suspected  Rosicrucian  origin.  It  is  presumed  that  this  Practice  of <br/>obliterating  the  owners  names  was  to  prevent  the  early  Rosicrucians  and  Hermetists  from  being  discovered  through  the <br/>volumes  composing  their  libraries.  Elias  Ashmole's  plate  shows  the  analogies  between  the  life  of  Christ  and  the  four  grand <br/>divisions  of  the  alchemical  process.  Herein  is  also  revealed  the  teaching  that  the  Philosopher's  Stone  itself  is  a  macrocosm <br/>and  a  microcosm,  embodying  the  principles  of  astronomy  and  cosmogony,  both  universal  and  human. <br/><br/><br/>p.  163 <br/><br/><br/>Later  the  Virgo  Lucifera  announced  that  a  comedy  was  to  be  performed  for  the  benefit  of  the  six  royal <br/>guests  in  a  building  called  the  House  of  the  Sun.  C.R.C.  and  his  companions  formed  part  of  the  royal <br/>procession,  which  after  a  considerable  walk  arrived  at  the  theater.  The  play  was  in  seven  acts,  and <br/>after  its  happy  ending  all  returned  through  the  garden  and  up  the  winding  stairs  to  the  throne  room. <br/>C.R.C.  noticed  the  young  King  was  very  sad  and  that  at  the  banquet  following  he  often  sent  meat  to <br/>the  white  serpent  in  the  skull.  The  feast  over,  the  young  King,  holding  in  his  hand  the  little  black  book <br/>from  the  altar,  asked  the  guests  if  they  would  all  be  true  to  him  through  prosperity  and  adversity,  and <br/>when  they  tremblingly  agreed  he  asked  that  each  should  sign  his  name  in  the  little  black  book  as  proof <br/>of  his  fealty.  The  royal  persons  then  drank  from  the  little  crystal  fountain,  the  others  afterwards  doing <br/>likewise.  This  was  called  the  &quot;Draught  of  Silence.&quot;  The  royal  persons  then  sadly  shook  hands  with  all <br/>present.  Suddenly  a  little  bell  tinkled  and  immediately  the  kings  and  queens  took  off  their  white <br/>garments  and  donned  black  ones,  the  room  was  hung  in  sable  draperies,  and  the  tables  were  removed. <br/>The  eyes  of  the  royal  persons  were  bound  with  six  black  taffeta  scarfs  and  six  coffins  were  placed  in <br/>the  center  of  the  room.  An  executioner,  a  Moor,  robed  in  black  and  bearing  an  axe,  entered,  and <br/>beheaded  in  turn  each  of  the  six  royal  persons.  The  blood  of  each  was  caught  in  a  golden  goblet,  which <br/>was  placed  in  the  coffins  with  the  body.  The  executioner  was  also  decapitated  and  his  head  placed  in  a <br/>small  chest. <br/><br/>The  Virgo  Lucifera,  after  assuring  C.R.C.  and  his  companions  that  all  should  be  well  if  they  were <br/>faithful  and  true,  ordered  the  pages  to  conduct  them  to  their  rooms  for  the  night  while  she  remained <br/>to  watch  with  the  dead.  About  midnight  C.R.C.  awakened  suddenly  and,  looking  from  his  window, <br/>beheld  seven  ships  sailing  upon  a  lake.  Above  each  hovered  a  flame;  these  he  believed  to  be  the  spirits <br/>of  the  beheaded.  When  the  ships  reached  shore,  the  Virgo  Lucifera  met  them  and  on  each  of  six  of  the <br/>vessels  was  placed  a  covered  coffin.  As  soon  as  the  coffins  had  been  thus  disposed  of,  the  lights  were <br/>extinguished  and  the  flames  passed  back  over  the  lake  so  that  there  remained  but  one  light  for  a <br/>watch  in  each  ship.  After  beholding  this  strange  ceremony,  C.R.C.  returned  to  his  bed  and  slept  till <br/>morning. <br/><br/>THE  FIFTH  DAY <br/><br/>Rising  at  daybreak  and  entreating  his  page  to  show  him  other  treasures  of  the  palace,  C.R.C.  was <br/>conducted  down  many  steps  to  a  great  iron  door  bearing  a  curious  inscription,  which  he  carefully <br/>copied.  Passing  through,  he  found  himself  in  the  royal  treasury,  the  light  in  which  came  entirely  from <br/>some  huge  carbuncles.  In  the  center  stood  the  triangular  sepulcher  of  Lady  Venus.  Lifting  a  copper <br/>door  in  the  pavement,  the  page  ushered  C.R.C.  into  a  crypt  where  stood  a  great  bed  upon  which,  when <br/>his  guide  had  raised  the  coverlets,  C.R.C.  beheld  the  body  of  Venus.  Led  by  his  page,  C.R.C.  then <br/>rejoined  his  companions,  saying  nothing  to  them  of  his  experience. <br/><br/>Virgo  Lucifera,  robed  in  black  velvet  and  accompanied  by  her  virgins,  then  led  the  guests  out  into  the <br/>courtyard  where  stood  six  coffins,  each  with  eight  pallbearers.  C.R.C.  was  the  only  one  of  the  group  of <br/>&quot;artists&quot;  who  suspected  the  royal  bodies  were  no  longer  in  these  coffins.  The  coffins  were  lowered  into <br/>graves  and  great  stones  rolled  over  them.  The  Virgo  Lucifera  then  made  a  short  oration  in  which  she <br/>exhorted  each  to  assist  in  restoring  the  royal  persons  to  life,  declaring  that  they  should  journey  with <br/>her  to  the  Tower  of  Olympus,  where  the  medicines  necessary  to  the  resurrection  of  the  six  royal <br/>persons  could  alone  be  found.  C.R.C.  and  his  companions  followed  Virgo  Lucifera  to  the  seashore, <br/>where  all  embarked  on  seven  ships  disposed  according  to  a  certain  strange  order.  As  the  ships  sailed <br/>across  the  lake  and  through  a  narrow  channel  into  the  open  sea,  they  were  attended  by  sirens, <br/>nymphs,  and  sea  goddesses,  who  in  honor  of  the  wedding  presented  a  great  and  beautiful  pearl  to  the <br/>royal  couple.  When  the  ships  came  in  sight  of  the  Tower  of  Olympus,  Virgo  Lucifera  ordered  the <br/>discharge  of  cannon  to  signal  their  approach.  Immediately  a  white  flag  appeared  upon  the  tower  and <br/>a  small  gilded  pinnace,  containing  an  ancient  man&#x2014;the  warden  of  the  tower &#x2014;with  his  white-clad <br/>guards  came  out  to  meet  the  ships. <br/><br/><br/>The  Tower  of  Olympus  stood  upon  an  island  which  was  exactly  square  and  was  surrounded  by  a  great <br/>wall.  Entering  the  gate,  the  group  was  led  to  the  bottom  of  the  central  tower,  which  contained  an <br/>excellent  laboratory  where  the  guests  were  fain  to  beat  and  wash  plants,  precious  stones,  and  all  sorts <br/>of  things,  extract  their  juice  and  essence,  and  put  these  latter  into  glasses.  Virgo  Lucifera  set  the <br/>&quot;artists&quot;  to  work  so  arduously  that  they  felt  they  were  mere  drudges.  When  the  day's  work  was <br/>finished,  each  was  assigned  a  mattress  on  the  stone  floor.  Being  unable  to  sleep,  C.R.C.  wandered <br/>about  contemplating  the  stars.  Chancing  upon  a  flight  of  steps  leading  to  the  top  of  the  wall,  he <br/>climbed  up  and  looked  out  upon  the  sea.  Remaining  here  for  some  time,  about  midnight  he  beheld <br/>seven  flames  which,  passing  over  the  sea  towards  him,  gathered  themselves  on  the  top  of  the  spire  of <br/>the  central  tower.  Simultaneously  the  winds  arose,  the  sea  became  tempestuous,  and  the  moon  was <br/>covered  with  clouds.  With  some  fear  C.R.C.  ran  down  the  stairs  and  returned  to  the  tower  and,  lying <br/>down  on  his  mattress,  was  lulled  to  sleep  by  the  sound  of  a  gently  flowing  fountain  in  the  laboratory. <br/><br/>THE  SIXTH  DAY <br/><br/>The  next  morning  the  aged  warden  of  the  tower,  after  examining  the  work  performed  by  the  wedding <br/>guests  in  the  laboratory  and  finding  it  satisfactory,  caused  ladders,  ropes,  and  large  wings  to  be <br/>brought  forth,  and  addressed  the  assembled  &quot;artists&quot;  thus:  &quot;My  dear  sons,  one  of  these  three  things <br/>must  each  of  you  this  day  constantly  bear  about  with  him.&quot;  Lots  were  cast  and  to  C.R.C,  much  to  his <br/>chagrin,  fell  a  heavy  ladder.  Those  who  secured  wings  had  them  fastened  to  their  backs  so  cunningly <br/>that  it  was  impossible  to  detect  that  they  were  artificial.  The  aged  warden  then  locked  the  &quot;artists&quot;  in <br/>the  lower  room  of  the  tower,  but  in  a  short  time  a  round  hole  was  uncovered  in  the  ceiling  and  Virgo <br/>Lucifera  invited  all  to  ascend.  Those  with  wings  flew  at  once  through  the  opening,  those  with  ropes <br/>had  many  difficulties,  while  C.R.C.  with  his  ladder  made  reasonable  speed.  On  the  second  floor  the <br/>wedding  guests,  musicians,  and  Virgo  Lucifera  gathered  about  a  fountain-like  contrivance  containing <br/>the  bodies  of  the  six  royal  persons. <br/><br/>Virgo  Lucifera  then  placed  the  if  Moor's  head  in  a  kettle-like  receptacle  in  the  upper  part  of  the <br/>fountain  and  poured  upon  it  the  substances  prepared  on  the  previous  day  in  the  laboratory.  The <br/>virgins  placed  lamps  beneath.  These  substances  when  they  boiled  passed  out  through  holes  in  the <br/>sides  of  the  kettle  and,  falling  upon  the  bodies  in  the  fountain  below,  dissolved  them.  The  six  royal <br/>bodies  having  been  reduced  thus  to  a  liquid  state,  a  tap  was  opened  in  the  lower  end  of  the  fountain <br/>and  the  fluid  drained  into  an  immense  golden  globe,  which,  when  filled,  was  of  great  weight.  All  but <br/>the  wedding  guests  then  retired  and  shortly  a  hole  in  the  ceiling  opened  as  before  and  the  guests <br/>ascended  pell-mell  to  the  third  floor.  Here  the  globe  were  suspended  by  a  strong  chain.  The  walls  of <br/>the  apartment  were  of  glass,  and  mirrors  were  so  arranged  that  the  sun's  rays  were  concentrated  upon <br/>the  central  globe,  thus  causing  it  to  become  very  hot.  Later  the  sun's  rays  were  deflected  and  the  globe <br/>permitted  to  cool,  after  which  it  was  cut  open  with  a  diamond,  revealing  a  beautiful  white  egg. <br/>Carrying  this  with  her,  Virgo  Lucifera  departed. <br/><br/>The  guests,  having  ascended  through  another  trap  door,  found <br/><br/><br/>THE  UNIVERSE  CREATED  BY  THE  DUAL  PRINCIPLE  OF  LIGHT  AND  DARKNESS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Fludd's  Philosophia  Mosaica. <br/><br/>The  Supreme  Deity  is  symbolized  by  the  small  globe  at  the  top,  which  is  divided  into  two  hemispheres,  the  dark  half <br/>representing  the  divine  darkness  with  which  the  Deity  surround  Himself  and  which  serves  as  His  hiding  place.  The <br/>radiant  hemisphere  signifies  the  divine  light  which  is  in  God  and  which,  pouring  forth,  manifests  as  the  objective  creative <br/>power.  The  large  dark  globe  to  the  left  and  beneath  the  dark  half  of  the  upper  sphere  signifies  the  potential  darkness <br/>which  was  upon  the  face  of  the  primordial  deep  and  within  which  moved  the  Spirit  of  God.  The  light  globe  to  the  right  is <br/>the  Deity  who  is  revealed  out  of  the  darkness.  Here  the  shining  Word  has  dissipated  the  shadows  and  a  glorious  universe <br/>has  been  formed.  The  divine  power  of  this  radiant  globe  is  cognizable  to  man  as  the  sun.  The  large  light  and  a  dark  section <br/>represents  the  created  universes  partaking  of  the  light  and  darkness  which  are  in  the  nature  of  the  Creator.  The  dark  half <br/>represents  the  Deep,  or  Chaos,  the  Eternal  Waters  pouring  forth  out  of  the  Deity;  the  light  half-circle  containing  the  figure <br/>of  Apollo  represents  the  diurnal  hemisphere  of  the  world,  which  in  the  ancient  Mysteries  was  ruled  over  by  Apollo.  The <br/>dark  half-circle  is  the  nocturnal  hemisphere  ruled  over  by  Dionysius  (Dionysos),  whose  figure  is  faintly  visible  in  the <br/>gloom. <br/><br/>p.  164 <br/><br/>themselves  upon  the  fourth  floor,  where  stood  a  square  kettle  filled  with  silver  sand  warmed  by  a <br/>gentle  fire.  The  great  white  egg  was  placed  upon  the  warm  sand  to  mature.  In  a  short  time  it  cracked <br/>and  there  emerged  an  ugly,  ill-tempered  bird,  which  was  fed  with  the  blood  of  the  beheaded  royal <br/>persons  diluted  with  prepared  water.  At  each  feeding  its  feathers  changed  color;  from  black  they <br/>turned  to  white  and  at  last  they  became  varicolored,  the  disposition  of  the  bird  improving  the  while. <br/>Dinner  was  then  served,  after  which  Virgo  Lucifera  departed  with  the  bird.  The  guests  ascended  with <br/><br/><br/>ropes,  ladders,  and  wings  to  the  fifth  floor,  where  a  bath  colored  with  fine  white  powder  had  been <br/>prepared  for  the  bird,  which  enjoyed  bathing  in  it  until  the  lamps  placed  beneath  the  bath  caused  the <br/>water  to  become  uncomfortably  warm.  When  the  heat  had  removed  all  the  bird's  feathers  it  was  taken <br/>out,  but  the  fire  continued  until  nothing  remained  in  the  bath  save  a  sediment  in  the  form  of  a  blue <br/>stone.  This  was  later  pounded  up  and  made  into  a  pigment;  with  this,  all  of  the  bird  except  the  head <br/>was  painted. <br/><br/>The  guests  thereupon  ascended  to  the  sixth  floor,  where  stood  a  small  altar  resembling  that  in  the <br/>King's  throne  room.  The  bird  drank  from  the  little  fountain  and  was  fed  with  the  blood  of  the  white <br/>serpent  which  crawled  through  the  openings  in  the  skull.  The  sphere  by  the  altar  revolved <br/>continuously.  The  watch  struck  one,  two,  and  then  three,  at  which  time  the  bird,  laying  its  neck  upon <br/>the  book,  suffered  itself  to  be  decapitated.  Its  body  was  burned  to  ashes,  which  were  placed  in  a  box  of <br/>cypress  wood.  Virgo  Lucifera  told  C.R.C.  and  three  of  his  comrades  that  they  were  lazy  and  sluggish <br/>&quot;labourators&quot;  and  would  therefore  be  excluded  from  the  seventh  room.  Musicians  were  sent  for,  who <br/>with  cornets  were  to  &quot;blow&quot;  the  four  in  ridicule  from  the  chamber.  C.R.C.  and  his  three  companions <br/>were  disheartened  until  the  musicians  told  them  to  be  of  good  cheer  and  led  them  up  a  winding  stair <br/>to  the  eighth  floor  of  the  tower  directly  beneath  the  roof.  Here  the  old  warden,  standing  upon  a  little <br/>round  furnace,  welcomed  them  and  congratulated  them  upon  being  chosen  by  Virgo  Lucifera,  for  this <br/>greater  work.  Virgo  Lucifera  then  entered,  and  after  laughing  at  the  perplexity  of  her  guests,  emptied <br/>the  ashes  of  the  bird  into  another  vessel,  filling  the  cypress  box  with  useless  matter.  She  thereupon <br/>returned  to  the  seventh  floor,  presumably  to  mislead  those  assembled  there  by  setting  them  to  work <br/>upon  the  false  ashes  in  the  box. <br/><br/>C.R.C.  and  his  three  friends  were  set  to  work  moistening  the  bird's  ashes  with  specially  prepared <br/>water  until  the  mixture  became  of  doughlike  consistency,  after  which  it  was  heated  and  molded  into <br/>two  miniature  forms.  Later  these  were  opened,  disclosing  two  bright  and  almost  transparent  human <br/>images  about  four  inches  high  (homunculi),  one  male  and  the  other  female.  These  tiny  forms  were <br/>laid  upon  satin  cushions  and  fed  drop  by  drop  with  the  blood  of  the  bird  until  they  grew  to  normal <br/>size  and  of  great  beauty.  Though  the  bodies  had  the  consistency  of  flesh,  they  showed  no  signs  of  life, <br/>for  the  soul  was  not  in  them.  The  bodies  were  next  surrounded  with  torches  and  their  faces  covered <br/>with  silk.  Virgo  Lucifera  then  appeared,  bearing  two  curious  white  garments.  The  virgins  also  entered, <br/>among  them  six  bearing  great  trumpets.  A  trumpet  was  placed  upon  the  mouth  of  one  of  the  two <br/>figures  and  C.R.C.  saw  a  tiny  hole  open  in  the  dome  of  the  tower  and  a  ray  of  light  descend  through <br/>the  tube  of  the  trumpet  and  enter  the  body.  This  process  was  repeated  three  times  on  each  body.  The <br/>two  newly  ensouled  forms  were  then  removed  upon  a  traveling  couch.  In  about  half  an  hour  the <br/>young  King  and  Queen  awakened  and  the  Virgo  Lucifera  presented  them  with  the  white  garments. <br/>These  they  donned  and  the  King  in  his  own  person  most  graciously  returned  thanks  to  C.R.C.  and  his <br/>companions,  after  which  the  royal  persons  departed  upon  a  ship.  C.R.C.  and  his  three  privileged <br/>friends  then  rejoined  the  other  &quot;artists,&quot;  making  no  mention  of  that  which  they  had  seen.  Later  the <br/>entire  party  were  assigned  handsome  chambers,  where  they  rested  till  morning. <br/><br/>THE  SEVENTH  DAY <br/><br/>In  the  morning  Virgo  Lucifera  announced  that  each  of  the  wedding  guests  had  become  a  &quot;Knight  of <br/>the  Golden  Stone. &quot;  The  aged  warden  then  presented  each  man  with  a  gold  medal,  bearing  on  one  side <br/>the  inscription  &quot;At.  Nat.  Mi. &quot;  and  on  the  other,  &quot;Tem.  Na.  F.&quot;  The  entire  company  returned  in  twelve <br/>ships  to  the  King's  palace.  The  flags  on  the  vessels  bore  the  signs  of  the  zodiac,  and  C.R.C.  sat  under <br/>that  of  Libra.  As  they  entered  the  lake,  many  ships  met  them  and  the  King  and  Queen,  together  with <br/>their  lords,  ladies,  and  virgins,  rode  forth  on  a  golden  barge  to  greet  the  returning  guests.  Atlas  then <br/>made  a  short  oration  in  the  King's  behalf,  also  asking  for  the  royal  presents.  In  reply  the  aged  warden <br/>delivered  to  Cupid,  who  hovered  about  the  royal  pair,  a  small,  curious-shaped  casket.  C.R.C.  and  the <br/>old  lord,  each  bearing  a  snow-white  ensign  with  a  red  cross  on  it,  rode  in  the  carriage  with  the  King. <br/>At  the  first  gate  stood  the  porter  with  blue  clothes,  who,  upon  seeing  C.R.C.,  begged  him  to  intercede <br/><br/><br/>with  the  King  to  release  him  from  that  post  of  servitude.  The  King  repUed  that  the  porter  was  a <br/><br/>famous  astrologer  who  was  forced  to  keep  the  gate  as  a  punishment  for  the  crime  of  having  gazed <br/>upon  Lady  Venus  reposing  upon  her  couch.  The  King  further  declared  that  the  porter  could  be <br/>released  only  when  another  was  found  who  had  committed  the  same  crime.  Upon  hearing  this, <br/>C.R.C.'s  heart  sank,  for  he  realized  himself  to  be  the  culprit,  but  he  remained  silent  at  that  time. <br/><br/>The  newly  created  Knights  of  the  Golden  Stone  were  obliged  to  subscribe  to  five  articles  drawn  up  by <br/>His  Royal  Highness:  (i)  That  they  would  ascribe  their  Order  only  to  God  and  His  handmaid.  Nature. <br/>(2)  That  they  should  abominate  all  uncleanness  and  vice.  (3)  That  they  should  always  be  ready  to <br/>assist  the  worthy  and  needy.  (4)  That  they  should  not  use  their  knowledge  and  power  for  the <br/>attainment  of  worldly  dignity.  (5)  That  they  should  not  desire  to  live  longer  than  God  had  decreed. <br/>They  were  then  duly  installed  as  Knights,  which  ceremony  was  ratified  in  a  little  chapel  where  C.  R.  C. <br/>hung  up  his  Golden  Fleece  and  his  hat  for  an  eternal  memorial,  and  here  he  inscribed  the  following: <br/>Summa  Scientia  nihil  Scire,  Fr.  Christianus  Rosencreutz.  Eques  aurei  Lapidis.  Anno  1459. <br/><br/>After  the  ceremony,  C.R.C.  admitted  that  he  was  the  one  who  had  beheld  Venus  and  consequently <br/>must  become  the  porter  of  the  gate.  The  King  embraced  him  fondly  and  he  was  assigned  to  a  great <br/>room  containing  three  beds&#x2014;one  for  himself,  one  for  the  aged  lord  of  the  tower,  and  the  third  for  old <br/>Atlas. <br/><br/>The  Chemical  Marriage  here  comes  to  an  abrupt  end,  leaving  the  impression  that  C.R.C.  was  to <br/>assume  his  duties  as  porter  on  the  following  morning.  The  book  ends  in  the  middle  of  a  sentence,  with <br/>a  note  in  italics  presumably  by  the  editor. <br/><br/>Under  the  symbolism  of  an  alchemical  marriage,  medieeval  philosophers  concealed  the  secret  system <br/>of  spiritual  culture  whereby  they  hoped  to  coordinate  the  disjecta  membra  of  both  the  human  and <br/>social  organisms.  Society,  they  maintained,  was  a  threefold  structure  and  had  its  analogy  in  the  triune <br/>constitution  of  man,  for  as  man  consists  of  spirit,  mind,  and  body,  so  society  is  made  up  of  the  church, <br/>the  state,  and  the  populace.  The  bigotry  of  the  church,  the  tyranny  of  the  state,  and  the  fury  of  the <br/>mob  are  the  three  murderous  agencies  of  society  which  seek  to  destroy  Truth  as  recounted  in  the <br/>Masonic  legend  of  Hiram  Abiff.  The  first  six  days  of  The  Chemical  Marriage  set  forth  the  processes  of <br/>philosophical  &quot;creation&quot;  through  which  every  organism  must  pass.  The  three  kings  are  the  threefold <br/>spirit  of  man  and  their  consorts  the  corresponding  vehicles  of  their  expression  in  the  lower  world.  The <br/>executioner  is  the  mind,  the  higher  part  of  which&#x2014;symbolized  by  the  head&#x2014; is  necessary  to  the <br/>achievement  of  the  philosophical  labor.  Thus  the  parts  of  man&#x2014; by  the  alchemists  symbolized  as <br/>planets  and  elements&#x2014; when  blended  together  according  to  a  certain  Divine  formula  result  in  the <br/>creation  of  two  philosophic  &quot;babes&quot;  which,  fed  upon  the  blood  of  the  alchemical  bird,  become  rulers <br/>of  the  world. <br/><br/>From  an  ethical  standpoint,  the  young  King  and  Queen  resurrected  at  the  summit  of  the  tower  and <br/>ensouled  by  Divine  Life  represent  the  forces  of  Intelligence  and  Love  which  must  ultimately  guide <br/>society.  Intelligence  and  Love  are  the  two  great  ethical  luminaries  of  the  world  and  correspond  to <br/>enlightened  spirit  and  regenerated  body.  The  bridegroom  is  reality  and  the  bride  the  regenerated <br/>being  who  attains  perfection  by  becoming  one  with  reality  through  a  cosmic  marriage  wherein  the <br/>mortal  part  attains  immortality  by  being  united  with  its  own  immortal  Source.  In  the  Hermetic <br/>Marriage  divine  and  human  consciousness  are  united  in  holy  wedlock  and  he  in  whom  this  sacred <br/>ceremony  takes  place  is  designated  as  &quot;Knight  of  the  Golden  Stone&quot;;  he  thereby  becomes  a  divine <br/>philosophic  diamond  composed  of  the  quintessence  of  his  own  sevenfold  constitution. <br/><br/>Such  is  the  true  interpretation  of  the  mystical  process  of  becoming  &quot;a  bride  of  the  Lamb.&quot;  The  Lamb <br/>of  God  is  signified  by  the  Golden  Fleece  that  Jason  was  forced  to  win  before  he  could  assume  his <br/>kingship.  The  Flying  Lion  is  illumined  will,  an  absolute  prerequisite  to  the  achievement  of  the  Great <br/>Work.  The  episode  of  weighing  the  souls  of  men  has  its  parallel  in  the  ceremony  described  in  the <br/><br/><br/>Egyptian  Book  of  the  Dead.  The  walled  city  entered  by  C.R.C.  represents  the  sanctuary  of  wisdom <br/>wherein  dwell  the  real  rulers  of  the  world&#x2014;the  initiated  philosophers. <br/><br/>Like  the  ancient  Mysteries  after  which  it  was  patterned,  the  Order  of  the  Rose  Cross  possessed  a <br/>secret  ritual  which  was  lived  by  the  candidate  for  a  prescribed  number  of  years  before  he  was  eligible <br/>to  the  inner  degrees  of  the  society.  The  various  floors  of  the  Tower  of  Olympus  represent  the  orbits  of <br/>the  planets.  The  ascent  of  the  philosophers  from  one  floor  to  another  also  parallels  certain  rituals  of <br/>the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  and  the  rites  of  Mithras  wherein  the  candidate  ascended  the  seven  rungs  of  a <br/>ladder  or  climbed  the  seven  steps  of  a  pyramid  in  order  to  signify  release  from  the  influences  of  the <br/>Planetary  Governors.  Man  becomes  master  of  the  seven  spheres  only  when  he  transmutes  the <br/>impulses  received  from  them.  He  who  masters  the  seven  worlds  and  is  reunited  with  the  Divine <br/>Source  of  his  own  nature  consummates  the  Hermetic  Marriage. <br/><br/><br/>p.  165 <br/><br/><br/>Bacon,  Shakspere,  and  the  Rosicrucians <br/><br/>THE  present  consideration  of  the  Bacon&#x2014;Shakspere&#x2014; Rosicrucian  controversy  is  undertaken  not  for <br/>the  vain  purpose  of  digging  up  dead  men's  bones  but  rather  in  the  hope  that  a  critical  analysis  will  aid <br/>in  the  rediscovery  of  that  knowledge  lost  to  the  world  since  the  oracles  were  silenced.  It  was  W.  F.  C. <br/>Wigston  who  called  the  Bard  of  Avon  &quot;phantom  Captain  Shakespeare,  the  Rosicrucian  mask.&quot;  This <br/>constitutes  one  of  the  most  significant  statements  relating  to  the  Bacon-Shakspere  controversy. <br/><br/>It  is  quite  evident  that  William  Shakspere  could  not,  unaided,  have  produced  the  immortal  writings <br/>bearing  his  name.  He  did  not  possess  the  necessary  literary  culture,  for  the  town  of  Stratford  where  he <br/>was  reared  contained  no  school  capable  of  imparting  the  higher  forms  of  learning  reflected  in  the <br/>writings  ascribed  to  him.  His  parents  were  illiterate,  and  in  his  early  life  he  evinced  a  total  disregard <br/>for  study.  There  are  in  existence  but  six  known  examples  of  Shakspere's  handwriting.  All  are <br/>signatures,  and  three  of  them  are  in  his  will.  The  scrawling,  uncertain  method  of  their  execution <br/>stamps  Shakspere  as  unfamiliar  with  the  use  of  a  pen,  and  it  is  obvious  either  that  he  copied  a <br/>signature  prepared  for  him  or  that  his  hand  was  guided  while  he  wrote.  No  autograph  manuscripts  of <br/>the  &quot;Shakespearian&quot;  plays  or  sonnets  have  been  discovered,  nor  is  there  even  a  tradition  concerning <br/>them  other  than  the  fantastic  and  impossible  statement  appearing  in  the  foreword  of  the  Great  Folio. <br/><br/>A  well-stocked  library  would  be  an  essential  part  of  the  equipment  of  an  author  whose  literary <br/>productions  demonstrate  him  to  be  familiar  with  the  literature  of  all  ages,  yet  there  is  no  record  that <br/>Shakspere  ever  possessed  a  library,  nor  does  he  make  any  mention  of  books  in  his  will.  Commenting <br/>on  the  known  illiteracy  of  Shakspere's  daughter  Judith,  who  at  twenty-seven  could  only  make  her <br/>mark,  Ignatius  Donnelly  declares  it  to  be  unbelievable  that  William  Shakspere  if  he  wrote  the  plays <br/>bearing  his  name  would  have  permitted  his  own  daughter  to  reach  womanhood  and  marry  without <br/>being  able  to  read  one  line  of  the  writings  that  made  her  father  wealthy  and  locally  famous. <br/><br/>The  query  also  has  been  raised,  &quot;Where  did  William  Shakspere  secure  his  knowledge  of  modern <br/>French,  Italian,  Spanish,  and  Danish,  to  say  nothing  of  classical  Latin  and  Greek?&quot;  For,  in  spite  of  the <br/>rare  discrimination  with  which  Latin  is  used  by  the  author  of  the  Shakespearian  plays,  Ben  Jonson, <br/>who  knew  Shakspere  intimately,  declared  that  the  Stratford  actor  understood  &quot;small  Latin  and  less <br/>Greek&quot;!  Is  it  not  also  more  than  strange  that  no  record  exists  of  William  Shakspere's  having  ever <br/>played  a  leading  role  in  the  famous  dramas  he  is  supposed  to  have  written  or  in  others  produced  by <br/>the  company  of  which  he  was  a  member?  True,  he  may  have  owned  a  small  interest  in  the  Globe <br/>Theatre  or  Blackfriars,  but  apparently  the  height  of  his  thespian  achievements  was  the  Ghost  in <br/>Hamletl <br/><br/>In  spite  of  his  admitted  avarice,  Shakspere  seemingly  made  no  effort  during  his  lifetime  to  control  or <br/>secure  remuneration  from  the  plays  bearing  his  name,  many  of  which  were  first  published <br/>anonymously.  As  far  as  can  be  ascertained,  none  of  his  heirs  were  involved  in  any  manner  whatsoever <br/>in  the  printing  of  the  First  Folio  after  his  death,  nor  did  they  benefit  financially  therefrom.  Had  he <br/>been  their  author,  Shakspere's  manuscripts  and  unpublished  plays  would  certainly  have  constituted <br/>his  most  valued  possessions,  yet  his  will &#x2014;while  making  special  disposition  of  his  second-best  bed  and <br/>his  &quot;broad  silver  gilt  bowl&quot;  neither  mentions  nor  intimates  that  he  possessed  any  literary  productions <br/>whatsoever. <br/><br/>While  the  Folios  and  Quartos  usually  are  signed  &quot;William  Shakespeare,&quot;  all  the  known  autographs  of <br/>the  Stratford  actor  read  &quot;William  Shakspere.&quot;  Does  this  change  in  spelling  contain  any  significance <br/>heretofore  generally  overlooked?  Furthermore,  if  the  publishers  of  the  First  Shakespearian  Folio <br/>revered  their  fellow  actor  as  much  as  their  claims  in  that  volume  would  indicate,  why  did  they,  as  if  in <br/><br/><br/>ironical  allusion  to  a  hoax  which  they  were  perpetrating,  place  an  evident  caricature  of  him  on  the <br/>title  page? <br/><br/>Certain  absurdities  also  in  Shakspere's  private  life  are  irreconcilable.  While  supposedly  at  the  zenith <br/>of  his  literary  career,  he  was  actually  engaged  in  buying  malt,  presumably  for  a  brewing  business! <br/>Also  picture  the  immortal  Shakspere~the  reputed  author  of  The  Merchant  of  Venice&#x2014; as  a <br/>moneylender!  Yet  among  those  against  whom  Shakspere  brought  action  to  collect  petty  sums  was  a <br/>fellow  townsman&#x2014;one  Philip  Rogers&#x2014;whom  he  sued  for  an  unpaid  loan  of  two  shillings,  or  about <br/>forty-eight  cents!  In  short,  there  is  nothing  known  in  the  life  of  Shakspere  that  would  justify  the <br/>literary  excellence  imputed  to  him. <br/><br/>The  philosophic  ideals  promulgated  throughout  the  Shakespearian  plays  distinctly  demonstrate  their <br/>author  to  have  been  thoroughly  familiar  with  certain  doctrines  and  tenets  peculiar  to  Rosicrucianism; <br/>in  fact  the  profundity  of  the  Shakespearian  productions  stamps  their  creator  as  one  of  the  illuminati <br/>of  the  ages.  Most  of  those  seeking  a  solution  for  the  Bacon-Shakspere  controversy  have  been <br/>intellectualists.  Notwithstanding  their  scholarly  attainments,  they  have  overlooked  the  important  part <br/>played  by  transcendentalism  in  the  philosophic  achievements  of  the  ages.  The  mysteries  of <br/>superphysics  are  inexplicable  to  the  materialist,  whose  training  does  not  equip  him  to  estimate  the <br/>extent  of  their  ramifications  and  complexities.  Yet  who  but  a  Platonist,  a  Qabbalist,  or  a  Pythagorean <br/>could  have  written  The  Tempest,  Macbeth,  Hamlet,  or  The  Tragedy  ofCymbeline?  Who  but  one <br/>deeply  versed  in  Paracelsian  lore  could  have  conceived,  A  Midsummer  Night's  Dream? <br/><br/>Father  of  modern  science,  remodeler <br/><br/><br/>HEADPIECE  SHOWING  LIGHT  AND  SHADED  A's. <br/><br/><br/>From  Shakespeare's  King  Richard  The  Second,  Quarto  of  1597. <br/><br/>The  ornamental  headpiece  shown  above  has  long  been  considered  a  Baconian  or  Rosicrucian  signature.  The  light  and  the <br/>dark  A's  appear  in  several  volumes  published  by  emissaries  of  the  Rosicrucians.  If  the  above  figure  be  compared  with  that <br/>from  the  Alciati  Emblemata  on  the  following  pages,  the  cryptic  use  of  the  two  A's  will  be  further  demonstrated. <br/><br/><br/>THE  TITLE  PAGE  OF  BURTON'S  ANATOMY  OF  MELANCHOLY. <br/><br/><br/>From  Burton's  Anatomy  of  Melancholy. <br/><br/>Baconian  experts  declare  Burton's  Anatomy  of  Melancholy  to  be  in  reality  Francis  Bacon's  scrapbook  in  which  he  gathered <br/>strange  and  rare  bits  of  knowledge  during  the  many  years  of  eventful  life.  This  title  page  has  long  been  supposed  to <br/>contain  a  cryptic  message.  The  key  to  this  cipher  is  the  pointing  figure  of  the  maniac  in  the  lower  right-hand  corner  of  the <br/>design.  According  to  Mrs.  Elizabeth  Wells  Gallup,  the  celestial  globe  at  which  the  maniac  is  pointing  is  a  cryptic  symbol  of <br/>Sir  Francis  Bacon.  The  planetary  signs  which  appear  in  the  clouds  opposite  the  marginal  figures  4,  5;,  6,  and  7  signify  the <br/>planetary  configurations,  which  produce  the  forms  of  mania  depicted.  The  seated  man,  with  his  head  resting  upon  his <br/>hand,  is  declared  by  Baconian  enthusiasts  to  represent  Sir  Francis  Bacon. <br/><br/>p.  166 <br/><br/>of  modern  law,  editor  of  the  modem  Bible,  patron  of  modem  democracy,  and  one  of  the  founders  of <br/>modern  Freemasonry,  Sir  Francis  Bacon  was  a  man  of  many  aims  and  purposes.  He  was  a <br/>Rosicrucian,  some  have  intimated  the  Rosicrucian.  If  not  actually  the  Illustrious  Father  C.R.C. <br/>referred  to  in  the  Rosicrucian  manifestoes,  he  was  certainly  a  high  initiate  of  the  Rosicrucian  Order, <br/>and  it  is  his  activities  in  connection  with  this  secret  body  that  are  of  prime  importance  to  students  of <br/>symbolism,  philosophy,  and  literature. <br/><br/>Scores  of  volumes  have  been  written  to  establish  Sir  Francis  Bacon  as  the  real  author  of  the  plays  and <br/>sonnets  popularly  ascribed  to  William  Shakspere.  An  impartial  consideration  of  these  documents <br/>cannot  but  convince  the  open-minded  of  the  verisimilitude  of  the  Baconian  theory.  In  fact  those <br/>enthusiasts  who  for  years  have  struggled  to  identify  Sir  Francis  Bacon  as  the  true  &quot;Bard  of  Avon&quot; <br/>might  long  since  have  won  their  case  had  they  emphasized  its  most  important  angle,  namely,  that  Sir <br/>Francis  Bacon,  the  Rosicrucian  initiate,  wrote  into  the  Shakespearian  plays  the  secret  teachings  of  the <br/><br/><br/>Fraternity  of  R.C.  and  the  true  rituals  of  the  Freemasonic  Order,  of  which  order  it  may  yet  be <br/><br/>discovered  that  he  was  the  actual  founder.  A  sentimental  world,  however,  dislikes  to  give  up  a <br/>traditional  hero,  either  to  solve  a  controversy  or  to  right  a  wrong.  Nevertheless,  if  it  can  be  proved <br/>that  by  raveling  out  the  riddle  there  can  be  discovered  information  of  practical  value  to  mankind,  then <br/>the  best  minds  of  the  world  will  cooperate  in  the  enterprise.  The  Bacon-Shakspere  controversy,  as  its <br/>most  able  advocates  realize,  involves  the  most  profound  aspects  of  science,  religion,  and  ethics;  he <br/>who  solves  its  mystery  may  yet  find  therein  the  key  to  the  supposedly  lost  wisdom  of  antiquity. <br/><br/>It  was  in  recognition  of  Bacon's  intellectual  accomplishments  that  King  James  turned  over  to  him  the <br/>translators'  manuscripts  of  what  is  now  known  as  the  King  James  Bible  for  the  presumable  purpose  of <br/>checking,  editing,  and  revising  them.  The  documents  remained  in  his  hands  for  nearly  a  year,  but  no <br/>information  is  to  be  had  concerning  what  occurred  in  that  time.  Regarding  this  work,  William  T. <br/>Smedley  writes: &quot;  It  will  eventually  be  proved  that  the  whole  scheme  of  the  Authorised  Version  of  the <br/>Bible  was  Francis  Bacon's.&quot;  (See  The  Mystery  of  Francis  Bacon.)  The  first  edition  of  the  King  James <br/>Bible  contains  a  cryptic  Baconian  headpiece.  Did  Bacon  cryptographically  conceal  in  the  Authorized <br/>Bible  that  which  he  dared  not  literally  reveal  in  the  text&#x2014;the  secret  Rosicrucian  key  to  mystic  and <br/>Masonic  Christianity? <br/><br/>Sir  Francis  Bacon  unquestionably  possessed  the  range  of  general  and  philosophical  knowledge <br/>necessary  to  write  the  Shakespearian  plays  and  sonnets,  for  it  is  usually  conceded  that  he  was  a <br/>composer,  lawyer,  and  linguist.  His  chaplain.  Doctor  William  Rawley,  and  Ben  Jonson  both  attest  his <br/>philosophic  and  poetic  accomplishments.  The  former  pays  Bacon  this  remarkable  tribute:  &quot;I  have <br/>been  enduced  to  think  that  if  there  were  a  beame  of  knowledge  derived  from  God  upon  any  man  in <br/>these  modern  times,  it  was  upon  him.  For  though  he  was  a  great  reader  of  books;  yet  he  had  not  his <br/>knowledge  from  books  but  from  some  grounds  and  notions  from  within  himself.  &quot;  (See  Introduction <br/>to  the  Resuscitado.) <br/><br/>Sir  Francis  Bacon,  being  not  only  an  able  barrister  but  also  a  polished  courtier,  also  possessed  that <br/>intimate  knowledge  of  parliamentary  law  and  the  etiquette  of  the  royal  court  revealed  in  the <br/>Shakespearian  plays  which  could  scarcely  have  been  acquired  by  a  man  in  the  humble  station  of  the <br/>Stratford  actor.  Lord  Verulam  furthermore  visited  many  of  the  foreign  countries  forming  the <br/>background  for  the  plays  and  was  therefore  in  a  position  to  create  the  authentic  local  atmosphere <br/>contained  therein,  but  there  is  no  record  of  William  Shakspere's  ever  having  traveled  outside  of <br/>England. <br/><br/>The  magnificent  library  amassed  by  Sir  Francis  Bacon  contained  the  very  volumes  necessary  to <br/>supply  the  quotations  and  anecdotes  incorporated  into  the  Shakespearian  plays.  Many  of  the  plays,  in <br/>fact,  were  taken  from  plots  in  earlier  writings  of  which  there  was  no  English  translation  at  that  time. <br/>Because  of  his  scholastic  acquirements,  Lord  Verulam  could  have  read  the  original  books;  it  is  most <br/>unlikely  that  William  Shakspere  could  have  done  so. <br/><br/>Abundant  cryptographic  proof  exists  that  Bacon  was  concerned  in  the  production  of  the <br/>Shakespearian  plays.  Sir  Francis  Bacon's  cipher  number  was  33.  In  the  First  Part  of  King  Henry  the <br/>Fourth,  the  word  &quot;Francis&quot;  appears  33  times  upon  one  page.  To  attain  this  end,  obviously  awkward <br/>sentences  were  required,  as:  &quot;Anon  Francis?  No  Francis,  but  tomorrow  Francis:  or  Francis,  on <br/>Thursday:  or  indeed  Francis  when  thou  wilt.  But  Francis.&quot; <br/><br/>Throughout  the  Shakespearian  Folios  and  Quartos  occur  scores  of  acrostic  signatures.  The  simplest <br/>form  of  the  acrostic  is  that  whereby  a  name&#x2014;in  these  instances  Bacon's&#x2014; was  hidden  in  the  first  few <br/>letters  of  lines.  In  The  Tempest,  Act  I,  Scene  2,  appears  a  striking  example  of  the  Baconian  acrostic: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;Begun  to  tell  me  what  I  am,  but  stopt <br/><br/>And  left  me  to  a  bootelesse  Inquisition, <br/>Concluding,  stay:  not  yet. <br/><br/>The  first  letters  of  the  first  and  second  lines  together  with  the  first  three  letters  of  the  third  line  form <br/>the  word  BACon.  Similar  acrostics  appear  frequently  in  Bacon's  acknowledged  writings. <br/><br/>The  tenor  of  the  Shakespearian  dramas  politically  is  in  harmony  with  the  recognized  viewpoints  of  Sir <br/>Francis  Bacon,  whose  enemies  are  frequently  caricatured  in  the  plays.  Likewise  their  religious, <br/>philosophic,  and  educational  undercurrents  all  reflect  his  personal  opinions.  Not  only  do  these <br/>marked  similarities  of  style  and  terminology  exist  in  Bacon's  writings  and  the  Shakespearian  plays, <br/>but  there  are  also  certain  historical  and  philosophical  inaccuracies  common  to  both,  such  as  identical <br/>misquotations  from  Aristotle. <br/><br/>&quot;Evidently  realizing  that  futurity  would  unveil  his  full  genius,  Lord  Verulam  in  his  will  bequeathed  his <br/>soul  to  God  above  by  the  oblations  of  his  Savior,  his  body  to  be  buried  obscurely,  his  name  and <br/>memory  to  men's  charitable  speeches,  to  foreign  nations,  to  succeeding  ages,  and  to  his  own <br/>countrymen  after  some  time  had  elapsed.  That  portion  appearing  in  italics  Bacon  deleted  from  his <br/>will,  apparently  fearing  that  he  had  said  too  much. <br/><br/>That  Sir  Francis  Bacon's  subterfuge  was  known  to  a  limited  few  during  his  lifetime  is  quite  evident. <br/>Accordingly,  stray  hints  regarding  the  true  author  of  the  Shakespearian  plays  maybe  found  in  many <br/>seventeenth  century  volumes.  On  page  33  (Bacon's  cipher  number)  of  the  1609  edition  of  Robert <br/>Cawdry's  Treasurie  or  Storehouse <br/><br/><br/>A  BACONIAN  SIGNATURE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Alciati  Emblemata. <br/><br/>The  curious  volume  from  which  this  figure  is  taken  was  pubhshed  in  Paris  in  r6i8.  The  attention  of  the  Baconian  student <br/>is  immediately  attracted  by  the  form  of  the  hog  in  the  foreground.  Bacon  often  used  this  animal  as  a  play  upon  his  own <br/>name,  especially  because  the  name  Bacon  was  derived  from  he  word  beech  and  the  nut  of  this  tree  was  used  to  fatten  hogs. <br/>The  two  pillars  in  the  background  have  considerable  Masonic  interest.  The  two  A's  nearly  in  the  center  of  the  picture&#x2014;one <br/>light  and  one  shaded&#x2014;are  alone  almost  conclusive  proof  of  Baconian  influence.  The  most  convincing  evidence,  however,  is <br/>the  fact  that  17  is  the  numerical  equivalent  of  the  letters  of  the  Latin  farm  of  Bacon's  name  (F.  Baco)  and  there  are  17 <br/>letters  in  the  three  words  appearing  in  the  illustration. <br/><br/><br/>sufs:  iTfSfc^^^^f  D^jrs  jrfL(?f5^  &#x00a3;)j:aff''  cjti^iESrt,jK*r  &quot; <br/><br/>FRANCIS  BACON,  BARON  VERULAM,  VISCOUNT  ST.  ALBANS. <br/><br/><br/>From  ^diCov!s  Advancement  of  Learning. <br/><br/><br/>Lord  Bacon  was  born  in  1561  and  history  records  his  death  in  1626.  There  are  records  in  existence,  however,  which  would <br/>indicate  the  probabihty  that  his  funeral  was  a  mock  funeral  and  that,  leaving  England,  he  lived  for  many  years  under <br/>another  name  in  Germany,  there  faithfully  serving  the  secret  society  to  the  promulgation  of  whose  doctrines  he  had <br/>consecrate  his  life.  Little  doubt  seems  to  exist  in  the  minds  of  impartial  investigators  that  Lord  Bacon  was  the  legitimate <br/>son  of  Queen  Elizabeth  and  the  Earl  of  Leicester. <br/><br/><br/>p.  167 <br/><br/><br/>of  Similes  appears  the  following  significant  allusion:  &quot;Like  as  men  would  laugh  at  a  poore  man,  if <br/>having  precious  garments  lent  him  to  act  and  play  the  part  of  some  honourable  personage  upon  a <br/>stage,  when  the  play  were  at  an  ende  he  should  keepe  them  as  his  owne,  and  bragge  up  and  downe  in <br/>them.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Repeated  references  to  the  word  hog  and  the  presence  of  cryptographic  statements  on  page  33  of <br/>various  contemporary  writings  demonstrate  that  the  keys  to  Bacon's  ciphers  were  his  own  name, <br/>words  playing  upon  it,  or  its  numerical  equivalent.  Notable  examples  are  the  famous  statement  of <br/>Mistress  Quickly  in  The  Merry  Wives  of  Windsor:  &quot;Hang-hog  is  latten  for  Bacon,  I  warrant  you&quot;;  the <br/>title  pages  of  The  Countess  of  Pembroke's  Arcadia  and  Edmund  Spenser's  Faerie  Queene;  and  the <br/>emblems  appearing  in  the  works  of  Alciatus  and  Wither.  Furthermore,  the  word <br/>honorificabilitudinitatibus  appearing  in  the  fifth  act  of  Love's  Labour's  Lost  is  a  Rosicrucian <br/>signature,  as  its  numerical  equivalent  (287)  indicates. <br/><br/>Again,  on  the  title  page  of  the  first  edition  of  Sir  Francis  Bacon's  New  Atlantis,  Father  Time  is <br/>depicted  bringing  a  female  figure  out  of  the  darkness  of  a  cave.  Around  the  device  is  a  Latin <br/><br/><br/>inscription:  &quot;In  time  the  secret  truth  shall  be  revealed.&quot;  The  catchwords  and  printer's  devices <br/>appearing  in  volumes  published  especially  during  the  first  half  of  the  seventeenth  century  were <br/>designed,  arranged,  and  in  some  cases  mutilated  according  to  a  definite  plan. <br/><br/>It  is  evident  also  that  the  mispaginations  in  the  Shakespearian  Folios  and  other  volumes  are  keys  to <br/>Baconian  ciphers,  for  re-editions&#x2014;often  from  new  type  and  by  different  printers&#x2014;contain  the  same <br/>mistakes.  For  example,  the  First  and  Second  Folios  of  Shakespeare  are  printed  from  entirely  different <br/>type  and  by  different  printers  nine  years  apart,  but  in  both  editions  page  153  of  the  Comedies  is <br/>numbered  151,  and  pages  249  and  250  are  numbered  250  and  251  respectively.  Also  in  the  1640 <br/>edition  of  Bacon's  The  Advancement  and  Proficience  of  Learning,  pages  353  and  354  are  numbered <br/>351  and  352  respectively,  and  in  the  1641  edition  of  Du  Bartas' Divine  Weeks  pages  346  to  350 <br/>inclusive  are  entirely  missing,  while  page  450  is  numbered  442.  The  frequency  with  which  pages <br/>ending  in  numbers  50,  51, 52,53,  and  54  are  involved  will  he  noted. <br/><br/>The  requirements  of  Lord  Verulam's  biliteral  cipher  are  fully  met  in  scores  of  volumes  printed <br/>between  1590  and  1650  and  in  some  printed  at  other  times.  An  examination  of  the  verses  by  L.  Digges, <br/>dedicated  to  the  memory  of  the  deceased  &quot;Authour  Maister  W.  Shakespeare,&quot;  reveals  the  use  of  two <br/>fonts  of  type  for  both  capital  and  small  letters,  the  differences  being  most  marked  in  the  capital  Ts, <br/>iVs,  and  A's,  (Seethe  First  Folio.)  The  cipher  has  been  deleted  from  subsequent  editions. <br/><br/>The  presence  of  hidden  material  in  the  text  is  often  indicated  by  needless  involvement  of  words.  On <br/>the  sixteenth  unnumbered  page  of  the  1641  edition  of  Du  Bartas'  Divine  Weeks  is  a  boar  surmounting <br/>a  pyramidal  text.  The  text  is  meaningless  jargon,  evidently  inserted  for  cryptographic  reasons  and <br/>marked  with  Bacon's  signature&#x2014;the  hog.  The  year  following  publication  of  the  First  Folio  of <br/>Shakespeare's  plays  in  1623,  there  was  printed  in  &quot;Lunseburg&quot;  a  remarkable  volume  on  cryptography, <br/>avowedly  by  Gustavus  Selenus.  It  is  considered  extremely  probable  that  this  volume  constitutes  the <br/>cryptographic  key  to  the  Great  Shakespearian  Folio. <br/><br/>Peculiar  symbolical  head-  and  tail-pieces  also  mark  the  presence  of  cryptograms.  While  such <br/>ornaments  are  found  in  many  early  printed  books,  certain  emblems  are  peculiar  to  volumes <br/>containing  Baconian  Rosi crucian  ciphers.  The  light  and  dark  shaded  A  is  an  interesting  example. <br/>Bearing  in  mind  the  frequent  recurrence  in  Baconian  symbolism  of  the  light  and  dark  shaded  A  and <br/>the  hog,  the  following  statement  by  Bacon  in  his  Interpretation  of  Nature  is  highly  significant:  &quot;If  the <br/>sow  with  her  snout  should  happen  to  imprint  the  letter  A  upon  the  ground,  wouldst  thou  therefore <br/>imagine  that  she  could  write  out  a  whole  tragedy  as  one  letter?&quot; <br/><br/>The  Rosicrucians  and  other  secret  societies  of  the  seventeenth  century  used  watermarks  as  mediums <br/>for  the  conveyance  of  cryptographic  references,  and  books  presumably  containing  Baconian  ciphers <br/>are  usually  printed  upon  paper  bearing  Rosicrucian  or  Masonic  watermarks;  often  there  are  several <br/>symbols  in  one  book,  such  as  the  Rose  Cross,  urns,  bunches  of  grapes,  and  others. <br/><br/>At  hand  is  a  document  which  may  prove  a  remarkable  key  to  a  cipher  beginning  in  The  Tragedy  of <br/>Cymbeline.  So  far  as  known  it  has  never  been  published  and  is  applicable  only  to  the  1623  Folio  of  the <br/>Shakespearian  plays.  The  cipher  is  a  line-and-word  count  involving  punctuation,  especially  the  long <br/>and  short  exclamation  points  and  the  straight  and  slanting  interrogation  points.  This  code  was <br/>discovered  by  Henry  William  Bearse  in  1900,  and  after  it  has  been  thoroughly  checked  its  exact <br/>nature  will  be  made  public. <br/><br/>No  reasonable  doubt  remains  that  the  Masonic  Order  is  the  direct  outgrowth  of  the  secret  societies  of <br/>the  Middle  Ages,  nor  can  it  be  denied  that  Freemasonry  is  permeated  by  the  symbolism  and <br/>mysticism  of  the  ancient  and  mediaeval  worlds.  Sir  Francis  Bacon  knew  the  true  secret  of  Masonic <br/>origin  and  there  is  reason  to  suspect  that  he  concealed  this  knowledge  in  cipher  and  cryptogram. <br/>Bacon  is  not  to  be  regarded  solely  as  a  man  but  rather  as  the  focal  point  between  an  invisible <br/><br/><br/>institution  and  a  world  which  was  never  able  to  distinguish  between  the  messenger  and  the  message <br/>which  he  promulgated.  This  secret  society,  having  rediscovered  the  lost  wisdom  of  the  ages  and <br/>fearing  that  the  knowledge  might  be  lost  again,  perpetuated  it  in  two  ways:  (i)  by  an  organization <br/>(Freemasonry) <br/><br/><br/>Many  documents  influenced  by  Baconian  philosophy&#x2014;or  intended  m  conceal  Baconian  or  Rosicrucian  cryptograms&#x2014;use <br/>certain  conventional  designs  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  chapters,  which  reveal  to  the  initiated  the  presence  of  concealed <br/>information.  The  above  ornamental  has  long  been  accepted  as  of  the  presence  of  Baconian  influence  and  is  to  be  found <br/>only  in  a  certain  number  of  rare  volumes,  all  of  which  contain  Baconian  cryptograms.  These  cipher  messages  were  placed <br/>in  the  books  either  by  Bacon  himself  or  by  contemporaneous  and  subsequent  authors  belonging  to  the  same  secret  society <br/>which  Bacon  served  with  his  remarkable  knowledge  of  ciphers  and  enigmas.  Variants  of  this  headpiece  adorn  the  Great <br/>Shakespearian  Folio  (1623);  Bacon's  Novum  Organum  (1620);  the  St.  James  Bible  (1611);  Spencer's  Faerie  Queene  (1611); <br/>and  Sir  Walter  Ralegh's  History  of  the  World  (1614)  (See  American  Baconiana.) <br/><br/><br/>Mt..

The  dissimilarities  the  Droeshout,  Chandos,  Janssen,  Hunt, <br/>Ashbourne,  Soest,  and  Dunford  portraits  prove  conclusively  that  the  artists  were  unaware  of  Shakspere's  actual  features. <br/>An  examination  of  the  Droeshout  portrait  discloses  several  peculiarities.  Baconian  enthusiasts  are  convinced  that  the  face <br/>is  only  a  caricature,  possibly  the  death  mask  of  Francis  Bacon.  A  comparison  of  the  Droeshout  Shakspere  with  portraits <br/>and  engravings  of  Francis  Bacon  demonstrates  the  identity  of  the  structure  of  the  two  faces,  the  difference  in  expression <br/>being  caused  by  lines  of  shading.  Not  also  the  peculiar  line  running  from  the  ear  down  to  the  chin.  Does  this  line  subtly <br/>signify  that  the  face  itself  a  mask,  ending  at  the  ear?  Notice  also  that  the  head  is  not  connected  with  the  body,  but  is <br/>resting  on  the  collar.  Most  strange  of  all  is  the  coat:  one-half  is  on  backwards.  In  drawing  the  jacket,  the  artist  has  made <br/>the  left  arm  correctly,  but  the  right  arm  has  the  back  of  the  shoulder  to  the  front.  Frank  Woodward  has  noted  that  there <br/>are  157  letters  on  the  title  page.  This  is  a  Rosicrucian  signature  of  first  importance.  The  date,  1623,  Plus  the  two  letters <br/>&quot;ON&quot;  from  the  word  &quot;LONDON,&quot;  gives  the  cryptic  signature  of  Francis  Bacon,  by  a  simple  numerical  cipher.  By  merely <br/>exchanging  the  26  letters  of  the  alphabet  for  numbers,  1  became  A,  6  becomes  F,  2  becomes  B,  and  3  becomes  C,  giving <br/>AFBC.  To  this  is  added  the  ON  from  LONDON,  resulting  in  AFBCON,  which  rearranged  forms  F.  BACON. <br/><br/>p.  168 <br/><br/>to  the  initiates  of  which  it  revealed  its  wisdom  in  the  form  of  symbols;  (2)  by  embodying  its  arcana  in <br/>the  literature  of  the  day  by  means  of  cunningly  contrived  ciphers  and  enigmas. <br/><br/>Evidence  points  to  the  existence  of  a  group  of  wise  and  illustrious  Fratres  who  assumed  the <br/>responsibility  of  publishing  and  preserving  for  future  generations  the  choicest  of  the  secret  books  of <br/>the  ancients,  together  with  certain  other  documents  which  they  themselves  had  prepared.  That  future <br/>members  of  their  fraternity  might  not  only  identiiy  these  volumes  bur  also  immediately  note  the <br/>significant  passages,  words,  chapters,  or  sections  therein,  they  created  a  symbolic  alphabet  of <br/>hieroglyphic  designs.  By  means  of  a  certain  key  and  order,  the  discerning  few  were  thus  enabled  to <br/>find  that  wisdom  by  which  a  man  is  &quot;raised&quot;  to  an  illumined  life. <br/><br/>The  tremendous  import  of  the  Baconian  mystery  is  daily  becoming  more  apparent.  Sir  Francis  Bacon <br/>was  a  link  in  that  great  chain  of  minds  which  has  perpetuated  the  secret  doctrine  of  antiquity  from  its <br/>beginning.  This  secret  doctrine  is  concealed  in  his  cryptic  writings.  The  search  for  this  divine  wisdom <br/>is  the  only  legitimate  motive  for  the  effort  to  decode  his  cryptograms. <br/><br/>Masonic  research  might  discover  much  of  value  if  it  would  turn  its  attention  to  certain  volumes <br/>published  during  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries  which  bear  the  stamp  and  signet  of  that <br/>secret  society  whose  members  first  established  modern  Freemasonry  but  themselves  remained  as  an <br/>intangible  group  controlling  and  directing  the  activities  of  the  outer  body.  The  unknown  history  and <br/>lost  rituals  of  Freemasonry  may  be  rediscovered  in  the  symbolism  and  cryptograms  of  the  Middle <br/>Ages.  Freemasonry  is  the  bright  and  glorious  son  of  a  mysterious  and  hidden  father.  It  cannot  trace <br/>its  parentage  because  that  origin  is  obscured  by  the  veil  of  the  superphysical  and  the  mystical.  The <br/>Great  Folio  of  1623  is  a  veritable  treasure  house  of  Masonic  lore  and  symbolism,  and  the  time  is  at <br/>hand  when  that  Great  Work  should  be  accorded  the  consideration  which  is  its  due. <br/><br/>Though  Christianity  shattered  the  material  organization  of  the  pagan  Mysteries,  it  could  not  destroy <br/><br/>the  knowledge  of  supernatural  power  which  the  pagans  possessed.  Therefore  it  is  known  that  the <br/>Mysteries  of  Greece  and  Egypt  were  secretly  perpetuated  through  the  early  centuries  of  the  church, <br/>and  later,  by  being  clothed  in  the  symbolism  of  Christianity,  were  accepted  as  elements  of  that  faith. <br/>Sir  Francis  Bacon  was  one  of  those  who  had  been  entrusted  with  the  perpetuation  and  dissemination <br/>of  s  the  arcana  of  the  superphysical  originally  in  the  possession  of  the  pagan  hierophants,  and  to <br/>attain  that  end  either  formulated  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  or  was  admitted  into  an  organization  already <br/>existing  under  that  name  and  became  one  of  its  principal  representatives. <br/><br/>For  some  reason  not  apparent  to  the  uninitiated  there  has  been  a  continued  and  consistent  effort  to <br/>prevent  the  unraveling  of  the  Baconian  skein.  Whatever  the  power  may  be  which  continually  blocks <br/>the  efforts  of  investigators,  it  is  as  unremitting  now  as  it  was  immediately  following  Bacon's  death, <br/>and  those  attempting  to  solve  the  enigma  still  feel  the  weight  of  its  resentment. <br/><br/><br/>A  misunderstanding  world  has  ever  persecuted  those  who  understood  the  secret  workings  of  Nature, <br/>seeking  in  every  conceivable  manner  to  exterminate  the  custodians  of  this  divine  wisdom.  Sir  Francis <br/>Bacon's  political  prestige  was  finally  undermined  and  Sir  Walter  Ralegh  met  a  shameful  fate  because <br/>their  transcendental  knowledge  was  considered  dangerous. <br/><br/>The  forging  of  Shakspere's  handwriting;  the  foisting  of  fraudulent  portraits  and  death  masks  upon  a <br/>gullible  public;  the  fabrication  of  spurious  biographies;  the  mutilation  of  books  and  documents;  the <br/>destruction  or  rendering  illegible  of  tablets  and  inscriptions  containing  cryptographic  messages,  have <br/>all  compounded  the  difficulties  attendant  upon  the  solution  of  the  Bacon-Shakspere-Rosicrucian <br/>riddle.  The  Ireland  forgeries  deceived  experts  for  years. <br/><br/>According  to  material  available,  the  supreme  council  of  the  Fraternity  of  R.C.  was  composed  of  a <br/>certain  number  of  individuals  who  had  died  what  is  known  as  the  &quot;philosophic  death.&quot;  When  the  time <br/>came  for  an  initiate  to  enter  upon  his  labors  for  the  Order,  he  conveniently  &quot;died&quot;  under  somewhat <br/>mysterious  circumstances.  In  reality  he  changed  his  name  and  place  of  residence,  and  a  box  of  rocks <br/>or  a  body  secured  for  the  purpose  was  buried  in  his  stead.  It  is  believed  that  this  happened  in  the  case <br/>of  Sir  Francis  Bacon  who,  like  all  servants  of  the  Mysteries,  renounced  all  personal  credit  and <br/>permitted  others  to  be  considered  as  the  authors  of  the  documents  which  he  wrote  or  inspired. <br/><br/>The  cryptic  writings  of  Francis  Bacon  constitute  one  of  the  most  powerful  tangible  elements  in  the <br/>mysteries  of  transcendentalism  and  symbolic  philosophy.  Apparently  many  years  must  yet  pass <br/>before  an  uncomprehending  world  will  appreciate  the  transcending  genius  of  that  mysterious  man <br/>who  wrote  the  Novum  Organum,  who  sailed  his  little  ship  far  out  into  the  unexplored  sea  of  learning <br/>through  the  Pillars  of  Hercules,  and  whose  ideals  for  a  new  civilization  are  magnificently  expressed  in <br/>the  Utopian  dream  of  The  New  Atlantis.  Was  Sir  Francis  Bacon  a  second  Prometheus?  Did  his  great <br/>love  for  the  people  of  the  world  and  his  pity  for  their  ignorance  cause  him  to  bring  the  divine  fire  from <br/>heaven  concealed  within  the  contents  of  a  printed  page? <br/><br/>In  all  probability,  the  keys  to  the  Baconian  riddle  will  be  found  in  classical  mythology.  He  who <br/>understands  the  secret  of  the  Seven- Rayed  God  will  comprehend  the  method  employed  by  Bacon  to <br/>accomplish  his  monumental  labor.  Aliases  were  assumed  by  him  in  accordance  with  the  attributes <br/>and  order  of  the  members  of  the  planetary  system.  One  of  the  least  known&#x2014;but  most  important&#x2014;keys <br/>to  the  Baconian  enigma  is  the  Third,  or  1637,  Edition,  published  in  Paris,  of  Les  Images  ou  Tableaux <br/>de  platte  peinture  des  deux  Philostrates  sophistes  grecs  et  les  statues  de  Callistrate,  by  Blaise  de <br/>Vigenere.  The  title  page  of  this  volume&#x2014; which,  as  the  name  of  the  author  when  properly  deciphered <br/>indicates,  was  written  by  or  under  the  direction  of  Bacon  or  his  secret  society&#x2014; is  one  mass  of <br/>important  Masonic  or  Rosicrucian  symbols.  On  page  486  appears  a  plate  entitled  &quot;Hercules  Furieux,&quot; <br/>showing  a  gigantic  figure  shaking  a  spear,  the  ground  before  him  strewn  with  curious  emblems.  In  his <br/>curious  work,  Das  Bild  des  Speershuttlers  die  Losung  des  Shakespeare-Rdtsels,  Alfred  Freund <br/>attempts  to  explain  the  Baconian  symbolism  in  the  Philostrates.  Bacon  he  reveals  as  the  philosophical <br/>Hercules,  whom  time  will  establish  as  the  true  &quot;Spear-Shaker&quot;  (Shakespeare). <br/><br/><br/>TITLE  PAGE  OF  THE  FAMOUS  FIRST  EDITION  OF  SIR  WALTER  RALEGH'S  HISTORY  OF  THE  WORLD. <br/><br/>From  Ralegh's  History  of  the  World. <br/><br/>What  was  the  mysterious  knowledge  which  Sir  Walter  Ralegh  possessed  and  which  was  declared  to  be  detrimental  to  the <br/>British  government?  Why  was  he  executed  when  the  charges  against  him  could  not  be  proved?  Was  he  a  member  of  me  of <br/>those  feared  and  hated  secret  societies  which  nearly  overthrew  political  and  religious  Europe  during  the  sixteenth  and <br/>seventeenth  centuries?  Was  Sir  Walter  Ralegh  an  important  factor  in  the  Bacon-Shakspere-Rosicrucian-Masonic  enigma? <br/>By  those  seeking  the  keys  to  this  great  controversy,  he  seems  to  have  been  almost  entirely  overlooked.  His  contemporaries <br/>are  unanimous  in  their  praise  of  his  remarkable  intellect,  and  he  has  long  been  considered  me  of  Britain's  most  brilliant <br/>sons. <br/><br/>Sir  Walter  Ralegh&#x2014;soldier,  courtier,  statesman,  writer,  poet,  philosopher,  and  explorer&#x2014;was  a  scintillating  figure  at  the <br/>court  of  Queen  Elizabeth.  Upon  this  same  man.  King  James&#x2014; after  the  death  of  Elizabeth&#x2014; heaped  every  indignity  within <br/>his  power.  The  cowardly  James,  who  shuddered  at  the  mention  of  weapons  and  cried  like  a  child  when  he  was  crossed, <br/>was  insanely  jealous  of  the  brilliant  courtier.  Ralegh's  enemies,  Playing  upon  the  king's  weakness,  did  not  cease  their <br/>relentless  persecution  until  Ralegh  had  been  hanged  and  his  decapitated,  quartered,  and  disemboweled  body  lay  at  their <br/>feet. <br/><br/>The  title  page  reproduced  above  was  used  by  Ralegh's  political  foes  as  a  powerful  weapon  against  him.  They  convinced <br/>James  I  that  the  face  of  the  central  figure  upholding  the  globe  was  a  caricature  of  his  own,  and  the  enraged  king  ordered <br/>every  copy  of  the  engraving  destroyed.  But  a  few  copies  escaped  the  royal  wrath;  consequently  the  plate  is  extremely  rare. <br/>The  engraving  is  a  mass  Rosicrucian  and  Masonic  symbols,  and  the  figures  on  the  columns  in  all  probability  conceal  a <br/>cryptogram.  More  significant  still  is  the  fact  that  the  page  facing  this  plate  is  a  headpiece  identical  with  that  used  in  the <br/>1623  Folio  of  &quot;Shakespeare&quot;  and  also  in  Bacon's  Novum  Organum. <br/><br/><br/>p.  169 <br/><br/><br/>The  Cryptogram  as  a  factor  in  Symbolic <br/><br/>Philosophy <br/><br/>NO  treatise  which  deals  with  symbolism  would  be  complete  without  a  section  devoted  to  the <br/>consideration  of  cryptograms.  The  use  of  ciphers  has  long  been  recognized  as  indispensable  in <br/>military  and  diplomatic  circles,  but  the  modern  world  has  overlooked  the  important  role  played  by <br/>cryptography  in  literature  and  philosophy.  If  the  art  of  deciphering  cryptograms  could  be  made <br/>popular,  it  would  result  in  the  discovery  of  much  hitherto  unsuspected  wisdom  possessed  by  both <br/>ancient  and  medieval  philosophers.  It  would  prove  that  many  apparently  verbose  and  rambling <br/>authors  were  wordy  for  the  sake  of  concealing  words.  Ciphers  are  hidden  in  the  most  subtle  manner: <br/>they  may  be  concealed  in  the  watermark  of  the  paper  upon  which  a  book  is  printed;  they  may  be <br/>bound  into  the  covers  of  ancient  books;  they  may  be  hidden  under  imperfect  pagination;  they  may  be <br/>extracted  from  the  first  letters  of  words  or  the  first  words  of  sentences;  they  may  be  artfully  concealed <br/>in  mathematical  equations  or  in  apparently  unintelligible  characters;  they  may  be  extracted  from  the <br/>jargon  of  clowns  or  revealed  by  heat  as  having  been  written  in  sympathetic  ink;  they  may  be  word <br/>ciphers,  letter  ciphers,  or  apparently  ambiguous  statements  whose  meaning  could  be  understood  only <br/>by  repeated  careful  readings;  they  may  he  discovered  in  the  elaborately  illuminated  initial  letters  of <br/>early  books  or  they  may  be  revealed  by  a  process  of  counting  words  or  letters.  If  those  interested  in <br/>Freemasonic  research  would  give  serious  consideration  to  this  subject,  they  might  find  in  books  and <br/>manuscripts  of  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries  the  information  necessary  to  bridge  the  gap  in <br/>Masonic  history  that  now  exists  between  the  Mysteries  of  the  ancient  world  and  the  Craft  Masonry  of <br/>the  last  three  centuries. <br/><br/>The  arcana  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  were  never  revealed  to  the  profane  except  through  the  media  of <br/>symbols.  Symbolism  fulfilled  the  dual  office  of  concealing  the  sacred  truths  from  the  uninitiated  and <br/><br/>revealing  them  to  those  qualified  to  understand  the  symbols.  Forms  are  the  symbols  of  formless <br/>divine  principles;  symbolism  is  the  language  of  Nature.  With  reverence  the  wise  pierce  the  veil  and <br/>with  clearer  vision  contemplate  the  reality;  but  the  ignorant,  unable  to  distinguish  between  the  false <br/>and  the  true,  behold  a  universe  of  symbols.  It  may  well  be  said  of  Nature&#x2014;the  Great  Mother&#x2014;that  she <br/>is  ever  tracing  strange  characters  upon  the  surface  of  things,  but  only  to  her  eldest  and  wisest  sons  as <br/>a  reward  for  their  faith  and  devotion  does  she  reveal  the  cryptic  alphabet  which  is  the  key  to  the <br/>import  of  these  tracings. <br/><br/>The  temples  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  evolved  their  own  sacred  languages,  known  only  to  their <br/>initiates  and  never  spoken  save  in  the  sanctuary.  The  illumined  priests  considered  it  sacrilege  to <br/>discuss  the  sacred  truths  of  the  higher  worlds  or  the  divine  verities  of  eternal  Nature  in  the  same <br/>tongue  as  that  used  by  the  vulgar  for  wrangling  and  dissension.  A  sacred  science  must  needs  be <br/>couched  in  a  sacred  language.  Secret  alphabets  also  were  invented,  and  whenever  the  secrets  of  the <br/>wise  were  committed  to  writing,  characters  meaningless  to  the  uninformed  were  employed.  Such <br/>forms  of  writing  were  called  sacred  or  Hermetic  alphabets.  Some&#x2014; such  as  the  famous  angelic <br/>writing&#x2014; are  still  retained  in  the  higher  degrees  of  Masonry. <br/><br/>Secret  alphabets  were  not  entirely  satisfactory,  however,  for  although  they  rendered  unintelligible  the <br/>true  nature  of  the  writings,  their  very  presence  disclosed  the  fact  of  concealed  information&#x2014; which  the <br/>priests  also  sought  to  conceal.  Through  patience  or  persecution,  the  keys  to  these  alphabets  were <br/>eventually  acquired  and  the  contents  of  the  documents  revealed  to  the  unworthy.  This  necessitated <br/>employment  of  more  subtle  methods  for  concealing  the  divine  truths.  The  result  was  the  appearance <br/>of  cryptic  systems  of  writing  designed  to  conceal  the  presence  of  both  the  message  and  the <br/>cryptogram.  Having  thus  devised  a  method  of  transmitting  their  secrets  to  posterity,  the  illuminati <br/><br/><br/>encouraged  the  circulation  of  certain  documents  specially  prepared  through  incorporating  into  them <br/><br/>ciphers  containing  the  deepest  secrets  of  mysticism  and  philosophy.  Thus  mediaeval  philosophers <br/>disseminated  their  theories  throughout  Europe  without  evoking  suspicion,  since  volumes  containing <br/>these  cryptograms  could  be  subjected  to  the  closest  scrutiny  without  revealing  the  presence  of  the <br/>hidden  message. <br/><br/>During  the  Middle  Ages  scores  of  writers&#x2014;members  of  secret  political  or  religious  organizations- <br/>published  books  containing  ciphers.  Secret  writing  became  a  fad;  every  European  court  had  its  own <br/>diplomatic  cipher,  and  the  intelligentsia  vied  with  one  another  in  devising  curious  and  complicated <br/>cryptograms.  The  literature  of  the  fifteenth,  sixteenth,  and  seventeenth  centuries  is  permeated  with <br/>ciphers,  few  of  which  have  ever  been  decoded.  Many  of  the  magnificent  scientific  and  philosophic <br/>intellects  of  this  period  dared  not  publish  their  findings,  because  of  the  religious  intolerance  of  their <br/>day.  In  order  to  preserve  the  fruitage  of  their  intellectual  labors  for  mankind,  these  pioneers  of <br/>progress  concealed  their  discoveries  in  ciphers,  trusting  that  future  generations,  more  kindly  than <br/>their  own,  would  discover  and  appreciate  their  learning. <br/><br/>Many  churchmen,  it  is  interesting  to  note,  used  cryptograms,  fearing  excommunication  or  a  worse <br/>fate  should  their  scientific  researches  be  suspected.  Only  recently  an  intricate  cipher  of  Roger  Bacon's <br/>has  been  unraveled,  revealing  the  fact  that  this  early  scientist  was  well  versed  in  the  cellular  theory. <br/>Lecturing  before  the  American  Philosophical  Society,  Dr.  William  Romaine  Newbold, <br/><br/><br/>A  FAMOUS  CRYPTIC  TITLE  PAGE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Selenus'  Cryptomenytices  et  Cryptographise. <br/><br/><br/>One  year  after  the  publication  of  the  first  Great  &quot;Shakespearian&quot;  Foho,  a  remarkable  volume  on  cryptogram,  and  ciphers <br/>was  published.  The  title  page  of  the  work  is  reproduced  above.  The  year  of  its  publication  (1624)  was  during  the <br/>Rosicrucian  controversy.  The  translation  of  the  title  page  is  as  follows: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Cryptomenysis  and  Cryptography  of  Gustavus  Selenus  in  nine  books,  to  which  is  added  a  clear  explanation  of  the <br/>System  of  Steganography  of  John  Trithemius,  Abbot  of  Spanheim  and  Herbipolis,  a  man  of  admirable  genius. <br/>Interspersed  with  worthy  inventions  of  the  Author  and  others,  1624.&quot;  The  author  of  this  volume  was  believed  to  be <br/>Augustus,  Duke  of  Brunswick.  The  symbols  and  emblems  ornamenting  the  title  page,  however,  are  conclusive  evidence <br/>that  the  fine  hand  of  the  Rosicrucians  was  behind  its  publication.  At  the  bottom  of  the  picture  is  a  nobleman  (Bacon?) <br/>placing  his  hat  on  another  man's  head.  In  the  oval  at  the  top  of  the  plate,  it  is  possible  that  the  lights  are  beacons,  or  a  play <br/>upon  the  name  Bacon.  In  the  two  side  panels  are  striking  and  subtle  &quot;Shakespearian&quot;  allusions.  On  the  left  is  a  nobleman <br/>(possibly  Bacon)  handing  a  paper  to  another  man  of  mean  appearance  who  carries  in  his  hand  a  spear.  At  the  right,  the <br/>man  who  previously  carried  the  spear  is  shown  in  the  costume  of  an  actor,  wearing  spurs  and  blowing  a  horn.  The  allusion <br/>to  the  actor  blowing  his  horn  and  the  figure  carrying  the  spear  suggest  much,  especially  as  spear  is  the  last  syllable  of  the <br/>name  &quot;Shakespeare.&quot; <br/><br/>p.  170 <br/><br/>who  translated  the  cipher  manuscript  of  the  friar,  declared:  &quot;There  are  drawings  which  so  accurately <br/>portray  the  actual  appearance  of  certain  objects  that  it  is  difficult  to  resist  the  inference  that  Bacon <br/>had  seen  them  with  the  microscope.  *  *  *  These  are  spermatozoa,  the  body  cells  and  the  seminiferous <br/>tubes,  the  ova,  with  their  nuclei  distinctly  indicated.  There  are  nine  large  drawings,  of  which  one  at <br/>least  bears  considerable  resemblance  to  a  certain  stage  of  development  of  a  fertilized  cell.&quot;  (See <br/>Review  of  Reviews,  July,  1921.)  Had  Roger  Bacon  failed  to  conceal  this  discovery  under  a  complicated <br/>cipher,  he  would  have  been  persecuted  as  a  heretic  and  would  probably  have  met  the  fate  of  other <br/>early  liberal  thinkers.  In  spite  of  the  rapid  progress  made  by  science  in  the  last  two  hundred  and  fifty <br/>years,  it  still  remains  ignorant  concerning  many  of  the  original  discoveries  made  by  mediseval <br/>investigators.  The  only  record  of  these  important  findings  is  that  contained  in  the  cryptograms  of  the <br/>volumes  which  they  published.  While  many  authors  have  written  on  the  subject  of  cryptography,  the <br/>books  most  valuable  to  students  of  philosophy  and  religion  are:  Polygraphia  and  Steganographia,  by <br/>Trithemius,  Abbot  of  Spanheim;  Mercury,  or  The  Secret  and  Swift  Messenger,  by  John  Wilkins, <br/>Bishop  of  Chester;  (Edipus  ^gyptiacus  and  other  works  by  Athanasius  Kircher,  Society  of  Jesus;  and <br/>Cryptomenytices  et  Cryptographise,  by  Gustavus  Selenus. <br/><br/>To  illustrate  the  basic  differences  in  their  construction  and  use,  the  various  forms  of  ciphers  are  here <br/>grouped  under  seven  general  headings: <br/><br/>1.  The  literal  cipher.  The  most  famous  of  all  literal  cr3T)tograms  is  the  famous  biliteral  cipher <br/>described  by  Sir  Francis  Bacon  in  his  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum.  Lord  Bacon  originated  the  system <br/>while  still  a  young  man  residing  in  Paris.  The  biliteral  cipher  requires  the  use  of  two  styles  of  type,  one <br/>an  ordinary  face  and  the  other  specially  cut.  The  differences  between  the  two  fonts  are  in  many  case <br/>so  minute  that  it  requires  a  powerful  magnifying  glass  to  detect  them.  Originally,  the  cipher  messages <br/>were  concealed  only  in  the  italicized  words,  sentences,  or  paragraphs,  because  the  italic  letters,  being <br/>more  ornate  than  the  Roman  letters,  offered  greater  opportunity  for  concealing  the  slight  but <br/>necessary  variations.  Sometimes  the  letters  vary  a  trifle  in  size;  at  other  times  in  thickness  or  in  their <br/>ornamental  flourishes.  Later,  Lord  Bacon  is  believed  to  have  had  two  Roman  alphabets  specially <br/>prepared  in  which  the  differences  were  so  trivial  that  it  is  almost  impossible  for  experts  to  distinguish <br/>them. <br/><br/>A  careful  inspection  of  the  first  four  &quot;Shakespeare&quot;  folios  discloses  the  use  throughout  the  volumes  of <br/>several  styles  of  type  differing  in  minute  but  distinguishable  details.  It  is  possible  that  all  the <br/>&quot;Shakespeare&quot;  folios  contain  ciphers  running  through  the  text.  These  ciphers  may  have  been  added  to <br/>the  original  plays,  which  are  much  longer  in  the  folios  than  in  the  original  quartos,  full  scenes  having <br/>been  added  in  some  instances. <br/><br/><br/>The  biliteral  cipher  was  not  confined  to  the  writings  of  Bacon  and  &quot;Shakespeare,&quot;  however,  but <br/>appears  in  many  books  published  during  Lord  Bacon's  lifetime  and  for  nearly  a  century  after  his  b <br/>death.  In  referring  to  the  biliteral  cipher,  Lord  Bacon  terms  it  omnia  per  omnia.  The  cipher  may  run <br/>through  an  entire  book  and  be  placed  therein  at  the  time  of  printing  without  the  knowledge  of  the <br/>original  author,  for  it  does  not  necessitate  the  changing  of  either  words  or  punctuation.  It  is  possible <br/>that  this  cipher  was  inserted  for  political  purposes  into  many  documents  and  volumes  published <br/>during  the  seventeenth  century.  It  is  well  known  that  ciphers  were  used  for  the  same  reason  as  early <br/>as  the  Council  of  Nicgea. <br/><br/>The  Baconian  biliteral  cipher  is  difficult  to  use  today,  owing  to  the  present  exact  standardization  of <br/>type  and  the  fact  that  so  few  books  are  now  hand  set.  Accompanying  this  chapter  are  facsimiles  of <br/>Lord  Bacon's  biliteral  alphabet  as  it  appeared  in  the  1640  English  translation  of  De  Augmentis <br/>Scientiarum.  There  are  four  alphabets,  two  for  the  capital  and  two  for  the  small  letters.  Consider <br/>carefully  the  differences  between  these  four  and  note  that  each  alphabet  has  the  power  of  either  the <br/>letter  a  or  the  letter  b,  and  that  when  reading  a  word  its  letters  are  divisible  into  one  of  two  groups: <br/>those  which  correspond  to  the  letter  a  and  those  which  correspond  to  the  letter  b.  In  order  to  employ <br/>the  biliteral  cipher,  a  document  must  contain  five  times  as  many  letters  as  there  are  in  the  cipher <br/>message  to  be  concealed,  for  it  requires  five  letters  to  conceal  one.  The  biliteral  cipher  somewhat <br/>resembles  a  telegraph  code  in  which  letters  are  changed  into  dots  and  dashes;  according  to  the <br/>biliteral  system,  however,  the  dots  and  dashes  are  represented  respectively  by  a's  and  b's.  The  word <br/>biliteral  is  derived  from  the  fact  that  all  letters  of  the  alphabet  may  be  reduced  to  either  a  or  6.  An <br/>example  of  biliteral  writing  is  shown  in  one  of  the  accompanying  diagrams.  In  order  to  demonstrate <br/>the  working  of  this  cipher,  the  message  concealed  within  the  words  &quot;Wisdom  and  understanding  are <br/>more  to  be  desired  than  riches&quot;  will  now  be  deciphered. <br/><br/>The  first  step  is  to  discover  [he  letters  of  each  alphabet  and  replace  them  by  their  equivalent  a  or  5  in <br/>accordance  with  the  key  given  by  Lord  Bacon  in  his  biliteral  alphabet  (q.v.).  In  the  word  wisdom,  the <br/>Wis  from  the  b  alphabet;  therefore  it  is  replaced  by  a  b.  The  i  is  from  the  a  alphabet;  therefore  an  a  is <br/>put  in  its  place.  The  s  is  also  from  the  a  alphabet,  but  the  d  belongs  to  the  b  alphabet.  The  o  and  the  m <br/>both  belong  to  the  a  alphabet  is  replaced  by  a.  By  this  process  the  word  WISDOM  become  baabaa. <br/>Treating  the  remaining  words  of  the  sentence  in  a  similar  manner,  AND  becomes  aba; <br/>UNDERSTANDING,  aaabaaaaaabab;  ARE,  aba;  MORE,  abbb;  TO,  ab;  BE,  ab;  DESIRED,  abaabaa; <br/>THAN,  aaba;  RICHES,  aaaaaa. <br/><br/>The  next  step  is  to  run  all  the  letters  together;  thus: <br/><br/>baabaaabaaaabaaaaaabababaabbbabababaabaaaabaaaaaaa.  All  the  combinations  used  in  the <br/>Baconian  biliteral  cipher  consist  of  groups  containing  five  letters  each.  Therefore  the  solid  line  of <br/>letters  must  be  broken  into  groups  of  five  in  the  following  manner:  baaba  aabaa  aabaa  aaaab  ababa <br/>abbba  babab  aabaa  aabaa  aaaaa.  Each  of  these  groups  of  five  letters  now  represents  one  letter  of <br/>the  cipher,  and  the  actual  letter  can  now  be  determined  by  comparing  the  groups  with  the <br/>alphabetical  table.  The  Key  to  the  Biliteral  Cipher,  from  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum  {q.v.):  baaba  -  T, <br/>aabaa  =  E,  aabaa  =  E;  aaaab  =  B;  ababa  =  L;  abbba  =  P;  babab  =  X;  aabaa  =  E,  aabaa  =  E;  aaaaa <br/>=  A;  but  the  last  five  letters  of  the  word  riches  being  set  off  by  a  period  from  the  initial  r,  the  last  five <br/>a's  do  not  count  in  the  cipher.  The  letters  thus  extracted  are  now  brought  together  in  order,  resulting <br/>in  TEEBLPXEE. <br/><br/>At  this  point  the  inquirer  might  reasonably  expect  the  letters  to  make  intelligible  words;  but  he  will <br/>very  likely  be  disappointed,  for,  as  in  the  case  above,  the  letters  thus  extracted  are  themselves  a <br/>cryptogram,  doubly  involved  to  discourage  those  who  might  have  a  casual  acquaintance  with  the <br/>biliteral  system.  The  next  step  is  to  apply  the  nine  letters  to  what  is  commonly  called  a  wheel  (or  disc) <br/>cipher  (q.v.),  which  consists  of  two  alphabets,  one  revolving  around  the  other  in  such  a  manner  that <br/>numerous  transpositions  of  letters  are  possible.  In  the  accompanying  cut  the  A  of  the  inner  alphabet <br/><br/><br/>am  m&amp;rt  l&amp; <br/><br/>ties  ire     tfmii  ric/ies <br/><br/>AN  EXAMPLE  OF  BILITERAL  WRITING. <br/><br/>In  the  above  sentence  note  carefully  the  formation  of  the  letters.  Compare  each  letter  with  the  two  types  of  letters  in  the <br/>biliteral  alphabet  table  reproduced  from  Lord  Bacon's  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum.  A  comparison  of  the  &quot;d&quot;  in  &quot;wisdom&quot; <br/>with  the  &quot;d&quot;  in  &quot;and&quot;  discloses  a  large  loop  at  the  top  of  the  first,  while  the  second  shows  practically  no  loop  at  all.  Contrast <br/>the  &quot;i&quot;  in  &quot;wisdom&quot;  with  the  &quot;i&quot;  in  &quot;understanding.&quot;  In  the  former,  the  lines  are  curved  and  in  the  latter  angular.  A  similar <br/>analysis  of  the  two  &quot;r's&quot;  in  &quot;desired&quot;  reveals  obvious  differences.  The  &quot;o&quot;  in  &quot;more&quot;  differs  only  from  the  &quot;o&quot;  in  &quot;wisdom&quot;  in <br/>that  it  a  tiny  line  continues  from  the  top  over  towards  the  &quot;r.&quot;  The  &quot;a&quot;  in  &quot;than&quot;  is  thinner  and  more  angular  than  the  &quot;a&quot;  in <br/>&quot;are,&quot;  while  the  &quot;r&quot;  in  &quot;riches&quot;  differs  from  that  in  &quot;desired&quot;  in  that  the  final  upright  stroke  terminates  in  a  ball  instead  of  a <br/>sharp  point.  These  minor  differences  disclose  the  presence  of  the  two  alphabets  employed  in  writing  the  sentence. <br/><br/><br/>g  ^  :   e  ^  &lt;^  ^ <br/><br/>Si    V    W     as  y  ^ <br/><br/>THE  KEY  TO  THE  BILITERAL  CIPHER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Bacon's  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum. <br/><br/><br/>After  the  document  to  be  deciphered  has  been  reduced  to  its  &quot;a&quot;  and  &quot;b&quot;  equivalents,  it  is  then  broken  up  into  five-letter <br/>groups  and  the  message  read  with  the  aid  of  the  above  table. <br/><br/><br/>A  MODERN  WHEEL,  OR  DISC,  CIPHER. <br/><br/><br/>The  above  diagram  shows  a  wheel  cipher.  The  smaller,  or  inner,  alphabet  moves  around  so  that  any  one  of  its  letters  may <br/>be  brought  opposite  any  me  of  he  letters  on  the  larger,  or  outer,  alphabet.  In  some,  cases  the  inner  alphabet  is  written <br/>backwards,  but  in  the  present  example,  both  alphabets  read  the  same  way. <br/><br/><br/>THE  BILTTERAL  ALPHABET. <br/><br/>From  Bacon's  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum. <br/><br/>This  Plate  is  reproduced  from  Bacon's  De  Augmentis  Scientiarum,  and  shows  the  two  alphabets  as  designed  by  him  for <br/>the  purpose  of  his  cipher.  Each  capital  and  small  letter  has  two  distinct  forms  which  are  designated  &quot;a&quot;  and  &quot;b&quot;.  The <br/>biliteral  system  did  not  in  every  instance  make  use  of  two  alphabets  in  which  the  differences  were  as  perceptible  as  in  the <br/>example  here  given,  but  the  two  alphabets  were  always  used;  sometimes  variations  are  so  minute  that  it  requires  a <br/>powerful  magnifying  glass  to  distinguish  the  difference  between  the  &quot;a&quot;  and  &quot;b&quot;  types  of  letters. <br/><br/>p.  171 <br/><br/>is  opposite  the  H  of  the  outer  alphabet,  so  that  for  cipher  purposes  these  letters  are  interchangeable. <br/>The  F  and  M,  the  P,  and  Y,  the  W  and  D,  in  fact  all  the  letters,  may  be  transposed  as  shown  by  the  two <br/>circles.  The  nine  letters  extracted  by  the  biliteral  cipher  may  thus  be  exchanged  for  nine  others  by  the <br/>wheel  cipher.  The  nine  letters  are  considered  as  being  on  the  inner  circle  of  the  wheel  and  are <br/>exchanged  for  the  nine  letters  on  the  outer  circle  which  are  opposite  the  inner  letters.  By  this  process <br/>the  T  becomes  A;  the  two  E's  become  two  L's;  the  B  becomes  I,  the  L  becomes  S;  the  P  becomes  W; <br/>the  X  becomes  E;  and  the  two  E's  become  two  L's.  The  result  is  ALLISWELL,  which,  broken  up  into <br/>words,  reads:  &quot;All  is  well.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Of  course,  by  moving  the  inner  disc  of  the  wheel  cipher,  many  different  combinations  in  addition  to <br/>the  one  given  above  can  be  made  of  the  letters,  but  this  is  the  only  one  which  will  produce  sense,  and <br/>the  cryptogrammatist  must  keep  on  experimenting  until  he  discovers  a  logical  and  intelligible <br/>message.  He  may  then  feel  reasonably  sure  that  he  has  deciphered  the  system.  Lord  Bacon  involved <br/>the  biliteral  cipher  in  many  different  ways.  There  are  probably  a  score  of  different  systems  used  in  the <br/>&quot;Shakespeare&quot;  folio  alone,  some  so  intricate  that  they  may  forever  baffle  all  attempts  at  their <br/>decipherment.  In  those  susceptible  of  solution,  sometimes  the  a's  and  b's  have  to  be  exchanged;  at <br/>other  times  the  concealed  message  is  written  backwards;  again  only  every  other  letter  is  counted;  and <br/>so  on. <br/><br/><br/>There  are  several  other  forms  of  the  Hteral  cipher  in  which  letters  are  substituted  for  each  other  by  a <br/>prearranged  sequence.  The  simplest  form  is  that  in  which  two  alphabets  are  written  thus: <br/><br/>ABCDEFGHI  KLMN <br/>ZYXWUTSRQPONM <br/><br/><br/>OPQRSTUWXYZ <br/>LKI  HGFEDCBA <br/><br/>By  substituting  the  letters  of  the  lower  alphabet  for  their  equivalents  in  the  upper  one,  a  meaningless <br/>conglomeration  results,  the  hidden  message  being  decoded  by  reversing  the  process.  There  is  also  a <br/>form  of  the  literal  cipher  in  which  the  actual  cryptogram  is  written  in  the  body  of  the  document,  but <br/>unimportant  words  are  inserted  between  important  ones  according  to  a  prearranged  order.  The  literal <br/>cipher  also  includes  what  are  called  acrostic  signatures&#x2014;that  is,  words  written  down  the  column  by <br/>the  use  of  the  first  letter  of  each  line  and  also  more  complicated  acrostics  in  which  the  important <br/>letters  are  scattered  through  entire  paragraphs  or  chapters.  The  two  accompanying  alchemical <br/>cryptograms  illustrate  another  form  of  the  literal  cipher  involving  the  first  letter  of  each  word.  Every <br/>cryptogram  based  upon  the  arrangement  or  combination  of  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  is  called  a <br/>literal  cipher. <br/><br/>2.  The  picfona/  cipher.  Any  picture  or  drawing  with  other  than  its  obvious  meaning  maybe <br/>considered  a  pictorial  cryptogram.  Instances  of  pictorial  cipher  are  frequently  found  in  Egyptian <br/>symbolism  and  early  religious  art.  The  diagrams  of  alchemists  and  Hermetic  philosophers  are <br/>invariably  pictorial  ciphers.  In  addition  to  the  simple  pictorial  cipher,  there  is  a  more  technical  form <br/>in  which  words  or  letters  are  concealed  by  the  number  of  stones  in  a  wall,  by  the  spread  of  birds' <br/>wings  in  flight,  by  ripples  on  the  surface  of  water,  or  by  the  length  and  order  of  lines  used  in  shading. <br/>Such  cryptograms  are  not  obvious,  and  must  be  decoded  with  the  aid  of  an  arbitrary  measuring  scale, <br/>the  length  of  the  lines  determining  the  letter  or  word  concealed.  The  shape  and  proportion  of  a <br/>building,  the  height  of  a  tower,  the  number  of  bars  in  a  window,  the  folds  of  a  man's  garments&#x2014;even <br/>the  proportions  or  attitude  of  the  human  body&#x2014; were  used  to  conceal  definite  figures  or  characters <br/>which  could  be  exchanged  for  letters  or  words  by  a  person  acquainted  with  the  code. <br/><br/>Initial  letters  of  names  were  secreted  in  architectural  arches  and  spans.  A  notable  example  of  this <br/>practice  is  found  on  the  title  page  of  Montaigne's  Essays,  third  edition,  where  an  initial  B  is  formed  by <br/>two  arches  and  an  F  by  a  broken  arch.  Pictorial  cryptograms  are  sometimes  accompanied  by  the  key <br/>necessary  for  their  decipherment.  A  figure  may  point  toward  the  starting  point  of  the  cipher  or  carry <br/>in  its  hand  some  implement  disclosing  the  system  of  measurement  used.  There  are  also  frequent <br/>instances  in  which  the  cryptographer  purposely  distorted  or  improperly  clothed  some  figure  in  his <br/>drawing  by  placing  the  hat  on  backwards,  the  sword  on  the  wrong  side,  or  the  shield  on  the  wrong <br/>arm,  or  by  employing  some  similar  artifice.  The  much-discussed  fifth  finger  on  the  Pope's  hand  in <br/>Raphael's  Sistine  Madonna  and  the  sixth  toe  on  Joseph's  foot  in  the  same  artist's  Marriage  of  the <br/>Virgin  are  cunningly  concealed  cryptograms. <br/><br/>3.  The  acroamatic  cipher.  The  religious  and  philosophical  writings  of  all  nations  abound  with <br/>acroamatic  cryptograms,  that  is,  parables  and  allegories.  The  acroamatic  is  unique  in  that  the <br/>document  containing  it  may  be  translated  or  reprinted  without  affecting  the  cryptogram.  Parables <br/>and  allegories  have  been  used  since  remote  antiquity  to  present  moral  truths  in  an  attractive  and <br/>understandable  manner.  The  acroamatic  cryptogram  is  a  pictorial  cipher  drawn  in  words  and  its <br/>symbolism  must  be  so  interpreted.  The  Old  and  New  Testaments  of  the  Jews,  the  writings  of  Plato <br/>and  Aristotle,  Homer's  Odyssey  and  Iliad,  Virgil's ^neid.  The  Metamorphosis  of  Apuleius,  and <br/>iEsop's  Fables  are  outstanding  examples  of  acroamatic  cryptography  in  which  are  concealed  the <br/>deepest  and  most  sublime  truths  of  ancient  mystical  philosophy. <br/><br/><br/>The  acroamatic  cipher  is  the  most  subtle  of  all,  for  the  parable  or  allegory  is  susceptible  of  several <br/>interpretations.  Bible  students  for  centuries  have  been  confronted  by  this  difficultly.  They  are <br/>satisfied  with  the  moral  interpretation  of  the  parable  and  forget  that  each  parable  and  allegory  is <br/>capable  of  seven  interpretations,  of  which  the  seventh&#x2014;the  highest&#x2014;is  complete  and  all-inclusive, <br/>whereas  the  other  six  (and  lesser)  interpretations  are  fragmentary,  revealing  but  part  of  the  mystery. <br/>The  creation  myths  of  the  world  are  acroamatic  cryptograms,  and  the  deities  of  the  various  pantheons <br/>are  only  cryptic  characters  which,  if  properly  understood,  become  the  constituents  of  a  divine <br/>alphabet.  The  initiated  few  comprehend  the  true  nature  of  this  alphabet,  but  the  uninitiated  many <br/>worship  the  letters  of  it  as  gods. <br/><br/><br/>AN  ALCHEMICAL  CRYPTOGRAM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Brown's  History  of  Chemistry. <br/><br/>James  Campbell  Brown  reprints  a  curious  cipher  from  Kircher.  The  capital  letters  of  the  seven  words  in  the  outer  circle <br/>read  clockwise,  form  the  word  SVLPHVR.  From  the  words  in  the  second  circle,  when  read  in  a  similar  manner,  is  derived <br/>FIXVM.  The  capitals  of  the  six  words  in  the  inner  circle,  when  properly  arranged,  also  read  ESTSOL.  The  following  cipher <br/>is  thus  extracted:  &quot;Sulphur  Fixum  Est  Sol,&quot;  which  when  translated  is:  &quot;Fixed  sulphur  is  gold.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>AN  ALCHEMICAL  CRYPTOGRAM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Geheime  Figuren  der  Rosenkreuzer. <br/><br/>Beginning  with  the  word  VISITA  and  reading  clockwise,  the  seven  initial  letters  of  the  seven  words  inscribed  in  the  outer <br/>circle  read:  VITRIOL.  This  is  a  very  simple  alchemical  enigma,  but  is  a  reminder  that  those  studying  works  on <br/>Hermeticism,  Rosicrucianism,  alchemy,  and  Freemasonry  should  always  be  on  the  lookout  for  concealed  meanings <br/>hidden  either  in  Parables  and  allegories  or  in  cryptic  arrangements  of  numbers,  letters,  and  words. <br/><br/><br/>A  CRYPTIC  DEPICTION  OF  DIVINE  AND  NATURAL  JUSTICE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Selenus'  Cryptomenytices  et  Cryptographiae. <br/><br/>The  first  circle  portrays  the  divine  antecedents  of  justice,  the  second  the  universal  scope  of  justice,  and  the  third  the <br/>results  of  human  application  of  justice.  Hence,  the  first  circle  deals  with  divine  principles,  the  second  circle  with  mundane <br/>affairs,  and  the  third  circle  with  man.  On  the  at  the  top  of  the  picture  sits  Themis,  the  presiding  spirit  of  law,  and  at  her <br/>feet  three  other  queens&#x2014; Juno,  Minerva,  and  Venus&#x2014;their  robes  ornamented  with  geometric  figures.  The  axis  of  law <br/>connects  the  throne,  of  divine  justice  above  with  the  throne  of  human  judgment  at  the  bottom  of  the  picture.  Upon  the <br/>latter  throne  is  seated  a  queen  with  a  scepter  in  her  hand,  before  whom  stands  the  winged  goddess  Nemesis&#x2014; the  angel  of <br/>judgment. <br/><br/>The  second  Circle  is  divided  into  three  parts  by  two  sets  of  two  horizontal  lines.  The  upper  and  light  section  is  called  the <br/>Supreme  Region  and  is  the  abode  of  the  gods,  the  good  spirits,  and  the  heroes.  The  lower  and  dark  section  is  the  abode  of <br/>lust,  sin,  and  ignorance.  Between  these  two  extremes  is  the  larger  section  in  which  are  blended  the  powers  and  impulses  of <br/>both  the  superior  and  the  inferior  regions. <br/><br/>In  the  third  or  inner  circle  is  man,  a  tenfold  creature,  consisting  of  nine  parts&#x2014; three  of  spirit,  three  of  intellect,  and  three <br/>of  soul&#x2014; enclosed  within  one  constitution.  According  to  Selenus,  man's  three  spiritual  qualities  are  thought,  speech,  and <br/>action;  his  three  intellectual  qualities  are  memory,  intelligence,  and  will;  and  his  three  qualities  of  soul  are  understanding, <br/>courage,  and  desire.  The  third  circle  is  further  divided  into  three  parts  called  ages:  the  Golden  Age  of  spiritual  truth  in  the <br/>upper  right  section,  the  Iron  Age  of  spiritual  darkness  in  the  lower  right  section  and  the  Bronze  Age&#x2014; a  composite  of  the <br/>two  occupying  the  entire  left  half  of  the  inner  circle  and  itself  divided  into  three  parts.  The  lowest  division  of  the  Bronze <br/>Age  depicts  ignorant  man  controlled  by  force,  the  central  the  partly  awakened  man  controlled  by  jurisprudence,  and  the <br/>upper  the  spiritually  illuminated  man  controlled  by  love.  Both  the  second  and  third  circles  revolve  upon  the  axis  of  law, <br/>but  the  divine  source,  of  law&#x2014; Heavenly  Justice&#x2014; is  concealed  by  clouds.  All  of  the  symbols  and  figures  ornamenting  the <br/>plate  are  devoted  to  a  detailed  amplification  of  the  principles  here  outlined. <br/><br/>p.  172 <br/><br/>4.  The  numerical  cipher.  Many  cryptograms  have  been  produced  in  which  numbers  in  various <br/>sequences  are  substituted  for  letters,  words,  or  even  complete  thoughts.  The  reading  of  numerical <br/><br/>ciphers  usually  depends  upon  the  possession  of  specially  arranged  tables  of  correspondences.  The <br/>numerical  cryptograms  of  the  Old  Testament  are  so  complicated  that  only  a  few  scholars  versed  in <br/>rabbinical  lore  have  ever  sought  to  unravel  their  mysteries.  In  his  (Edipus  ^gyptiacus,  Athanasius <br/><br/><br/>Kircher  describes  several  Arabian  Qabbalistic  theorems,  and  a  great  part  of  the  Pythagorean  mystery <br/>was  concealed  in  a  secret  method  in  vogue  among  Greek  mystics  of  substituting  letters  for  numbers. <br/><br/>The  most  simple  numerical  cipher  is  that  in  which  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  are  exchanged  for <br/>numbers  in  ordinary  sequence.  Thus  A  becomes  i,B2,C  3,  and  so  on,  counting  both  I  and  J  as  9  and <br/>both  U  and  l^as  20.  The  word  yes  by  this  system  would  be  written  23-5-18.  This  cipher  can  be  made <br/>more  difficult  by  reversing  the  alphabet  so  that  Z becomes  1,  F2,  X  3,  and  so  on.  By  inserting  a  non- <br/>significant, or  uncounted,  number  after  each  of  the  significant  numbers  the  cipher  is  still  more <br/>effectively  concealed,  thus:  23-16-5-9-18.  The  word  yes  is  found  by  eliminating  the  second  and  fourth <br/>numbers.  By  adding  23,  5,  and  18  together  the  sum  46  results.  Therefore  46  is  the  numerical <br/>equivalent  of  the  word  yes.  According  to  the  simple  numerical  cipher,  the  sum  138  is  equal  to  the <br/>words  Note  carefully.  Therefore  in  a  book  using  this  method,  line  138,  page  138,  or  paragraph  138 <br/>may  contain  the  concealed  message.  In  addition  to  this  simple  numerical  cipher  there  are  scores  of <br/>others  so  complicated  that  no  one  without  the  key  can  hope  to  solve  them. <br/><br/>Authors  sometimes  based  their  cryptograms  upon  the  numerical  value  of  their  own  names;  for <br/>example.  Sir  Francis  Bacon  repeatedly  used  the  cryptic  number  33~the  numerical  equivalent  of  his <br/>name.  Numerical  ciphers  often  involve  the  pagination  of  a  book.  Imperfect  pagination,  though <br/>generally  attributed  to  carelessness,  often  conceals  important  secrets.  The  mispaginations  found  in <br/>the  1623  folio  of  &quot;Shakespeare&quot;  and  the  consistent  recurrence  of  similar  errors  in  various  volumes <br/>printed  about  the  same  period  have  occasioned  considerable  thought  among  scholars  and <br/>cryptogrammatists.  In  Baconian  cryptograms,  all  page  numbers  ending  in  89  seem  to  have  a  special <br/>significance.  The  89th  page  of  the  Comedies  in  the  1623  folio  of  &quot;Shakespeare&quot;  shows  an  error  of  type <br/>in  the  pagination,  the  &quot;9&quot;  being  from  a  considerably  smaller  font  than  the  &quot;8.&quot;  The  189th  page  is <br/>entirely  missing,  there  being  two  pages  numbered  187;  and  page  188  shows  the  second  &quot;  8  &quot;  scarcely <br/>more  than  half  the  size  of  the  first  one.  Page  289  is  correctly  numbered  and  has  no  unusual  features, <br/>but  page  89  of  the  Histories  is  missing.  Several  volumes  published  by  Bacon  show  similar  errors,  page <br/>89  being  often  involved. <br/><br/>There  are  also  numerical  ciphers  from  which  the  cryptic  message  may  be  extracted  by  counting  every <br/>tenth  word,  every  twentieth  word,  or  every  fiftieth  word.  In  some  cases  the  count  is  irregular.  The  first <br/>important  word  may  be  found  by  counting  100,  the  second  by  counting  90,  the  third  by  counting  80, <br/>and  so  on  until  the  count  of  10  is  reached.  The  count  then  returns  to  100  and  the  process  is  repeated. <br/><br/>5.  The  musical  cipher.  John  Wilkins,  afterwards  Bishop  of  Chester,  in  1641  circulated  an  anonymous <br/>essay  entitled  Mercury,  or  the  Secret  and  Swift  Messenger.  In  this  little  volume,  which  was  largely <br/>derived  from  the  more  voluminous  treatises  of  Trithemius  and  Selenus,  the  author  sets  forth  a <br/>method  whereby  musicians  can  converse  with  each  other  by  substituting  musical  notes  for  the  letters <br/>of  the  alphabet.  Two  persons  understanding  the  code  could  converse  with  each  other  by  merely <br/>playing  certain  notes  upon  a  piano  or  other  instrument.  Musical  cryptograms  can  be  involved  to  an <br/>inconceivable  point;  by  certain  systems  it  is  possible  to  take  an  already  existing  musical  theme  and <br/>conceal  in  it  a  cryptogram  without  actually  changing  the  composition  in  any  way.  The  pennants  upon <br/>the  notes  may  conceal  the  cipher,  or  the  actual  sounds  of  the  notes  may  be  exchanged  for  syllables  of <br/>similar  sound.  This  latter  method  is  effective  but  its  scope  is  somewhat  limited.  Several  musical <br/>compositions  by  Sir  Francis  Bacon  are  still  in  existence.  An  examination  of  them  might  reveal  musical <br/>cryptograms,  for  it  is  quite  certain  that  Lord  Bacon  was  well  acquainted  with  the  manner  of  their <br/>construction. <br/><br/>6.  The  arbitrary  cipher.  The  system  of  exchanging  letters  of  the  alphabet  for  hieroglyphic  figures  is <br/>too  easily  decoded  to  be  popular.  Albert:  Pike  describes  an  arbitrary  cipher  based  upon  the  various <br/>parts  of  the  Knights  Templars'  cross,  each  angle  representing  a  letter.  The  many  curious  alphabets <br/>that  have  been  devised  are  rendered  worthless,  however,  by  the  table  of  recurrence.  According  to <br/>Edgar  Allan  Poe,  a  great  cryptogrammatist,  the  most  common  letter  of  the  English  language  is  E,  the <br/><br/><br/>other  letters  in  their  order  of  frequency  are  as  follows:  A,  O,  I,  D,  H,  N,  R,  S,  T,  V,  Y,  C,  F,  Q  L,  M,  W,  B, <br/>K,  P,  Q,  X,  Z.  Other  authorities  declare  the  table  of  frequency  to  be:  E,  T,  A,  O,  N,  I,  R,  S,  H,  D,  L,  C,  W, <br/>U,  M,  F,  Y,  G,  P,  B,  V,  K,  X,  Q,  J,  Z.  By  merely  counting  the  number  of  times  each  character  appears  in <br/>the  message,  the  law  of  recurrence  discloses  the  English  letter  for  which  the  arbitrary  character <br/>stands.  Further  help  is  also  rendered  by  the  fact  that  if  the  cryptogram  be  split  up  into  words  there  are <br/>only  three  single  letters  which  may  form  words:  A,  I,  O.  Thus  any  single  character  set  off  from  the  rest <br/>of  the  text  must  be  one  of  these  three  letters.  For  details  of  this  System  see  The  Gold  Bug,  by  Edgar <br/>Allan  Poe. <br/><br/>To  render  more  difficult  the  decoding  of  arbitrary  ciphers,  however,  the  characters  are  seldom  broken <br/>up  into  words,  and,  further,  the  table  of  recurrence  is  partly  nullified  by  assigning  two  or  more <br/>different  characters  to  each  letter,  thereby  making  it  impossible  to  estimate  accurately  the  frequency <br/>of  recurrence.  Therefore,  the  greater  the  number  of  arbitrary  characters  used  to  represent  any  single <br/>letter  of  the  alphabet,  the  more  difficult  it  is  to  decipher  an  arbitrary  cryptogram.  The  secret  alphabets <br/>of  the  ancients  are  comparatively  easy  to  decode,  the  only  requisites  being  a  table  of  frequency,  a <br/>knowledge  of  the  language  in  which  the  cryptogram  was  originally  written,  a  moderate  amount  of <br/>patience,  and  a  little  ingenuity. <br/><br/>7.  The  code  cipher.  The  most  modem  form  of  cryptogram  is  the  code  system.  Its  most  familiar  form  is <br/>the  Morse  code  for  use  in  telegraphic  and  wireless  communication.  This  form  of  cipher  may  be <br/>complicated  somewhat  by  embodying  dots  and  dashes  into  a  document  in  which  periods  and  colons <br/>are  dots,  while  commas  and  semicolons  are  dashes.  There  are  also  codes  used  by  the  business  world <br/>which  can  be  solved  only  by  the  use  of  a  private  code  book.  Because  they  furnish  an  economical  and <br/>efficient  method  of  transmitting  confidential  information,  the  use  of  such  codes  is  far  more  prevalent <br/>than  the  average  person  has  any  suspicion. <br/><br/>In  addition  to  the  foregoing  classifications  there  are  a  number  of  miscellaneous  systems  of  secret <br/>writing,  some  employing  mechanical  devices,  others  colors.  A  few  make  use  of  sundry  miscellaneous <br/>objects  to  represent  words  and  even  complete  thoughts.  But  as  these  more  elaborate  devices  were <br/>seldom  employed  by  the  ancients  or  by  the  mediaeval  philosophers  and  alchemists,  they  have  no <br/>direct  bearing  upon  religion  and  philosophy.  The  mystics  of  the  Middle  Ages,  borrowing  the <br/>terminology  of  the  various  arts  and  sciences,  evolved  a  system  of  cryptography  which  concealed  the <br/>secrets  of  the  human  soul  under  terms  generally  applied  to  chemistry,  biology,  astronomy,  botany, <br/>and  physiology.  Ciphers  of  this  nature  can  only  be  decoded  by  individuals  versed  in  the  deep <br/>philosophic  principles  upon  which  these  medieeval  mystics  based  their  theories  of  life.  Much <br/>information  relating  to  the  invisible  nature  of  man  is  concealed  under  what  seem  to  be  chemical <br/>experiments  or  scientific  speculations.  Every  student  of  symbolism  and  philosophy,  therefore,  should <br/>be  reasonably  well  acquainted  with  the  underlying  principles  of  cryptography;  in  addition  to  serving <br/>him  well  in  his  researches,  this  art  furnishes  a  fascinating  method  of  developing  the  acuteness  of  the <br/>mental  faculties.  Discrimination  and  observation  are  indispensable  to  the  seeker  after  knowledge,  and <br/>no  study  is  equal  to  cryptography  as  a  means  of  stimulating  these  powers. <br/><br/><br/>&#x00ab;AUnTITlH2X <br/><br/>fkfi     Jtd     TMftk      ChttA      s&#x00ab;*    mm  J&amp;    ja^kA  Sumt  JMi <br/><br/>^f'A  Kmjif  Zstic <br/><br/>vtutx <br/><br/><br/>tt1HJ <br/><br/><br/>QABBAUSTIC  AND  MAGIC  ALPHABETS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Barrett's  Magus. <br/><br/><br/>Curious  alphabets  were  invented  by  the  early  and  mediaeval  philosophers  to  conceal  their  doctrines  and  tenets  from  the <br/>profane.  Some  of  these  alphabets  are  still  used  to  a  limited  extent  in  the  higher  degrees  of  Freemasonry.  Probably  the <br/>most  famous  is  the  angelic  writing,  termed  in  the  above  plate  &quot;The  Writing  called  Malachim.&quot;  Its  figures  are  supposedly <br/>derived  from  the  constellations.  Advanced  students  of  occult  philosophy  will  come  upon  many  valuable  documents  in <br/>which  these  figures  are  used.  Under  each  letter  of  the  first  alphabet  above  is  its  equivalent  in  English.  Above  each  letter  of <br/>the  other  three  alphabets  is  its  Hebrew  letter  equivalent. <br/><br/><br/>p-173 <br/><br/><br/>Freemasonic  Symbolism <br/><br/>IN  several  early  Masonic  manuscripts&#x2014;for  example,  the  Harleian,  Sloane,  Lansdowne,  and <br/>Edinburgh-Kilwinning~it  is  stated  that  the  craft  of  initiated  builders  existed  before  the  Deluge,  and <br/>that  its  members  were  employed  in  the  building  of  the  Tower  of  Babel.  A  Masonic  Constitution  dated <br/>1701  gives  the  following  naive  account  of  the  origin  of  the  sciences,  arts,  and  crafts  from  which  the <br/>major  part  of  Masonic  symbolism  is  derived: <br/><br/>&quot;How  this  worthy  Science  was  first  begunne,  I  shall  tell.  Before  Noah's  Flood,  there  was  a  man  called <br/>Lameck  as  it  is  written  in  the  4  Chap,  of  Gen.:  and  this  Lameck  had  two  Wives.  The  one  was  called <br/>Adah,  and  the  other  Zillah;  by  the  first  wife  Adah  he  gott  two  Sons,  the  one  called  Jaball,  and  the <br/>other  Juball,  and  by  the  other  wife  Zillah  he  got  a  Son  and  Daughter,  and  the  four  children  found  the <br/>beginning  of  all  Crafts  in  the  world.  This  Jaball  was  the  elder  Son,  and  he  found  the  Craft  of <br/>Geometric,  and  he  parted  flocks,  as  of  Sheep  and  Lambs  in  the  fields,  and  first  wrought  Houses  of <br/>Stone  and  Tree,  as  it  is  noted  in  the  Chap,  aforesaid,  and  his  Brother  Juball  found  the  crafte  of  Musick, <br/>of  Songs,  Organs  and  Harp.  The  Third  Brother  [Tubal-cain]  found  out  Smith's  craft  to  work  Iron  and <br/>steel,  and  their  sister  Naamah  found  out  the  art  of  Weaving.  These  children  did  know  thatt  God  would <br/>take  Vengeance  for  Sinne,  either  by  fire  or  water,  wherefor  they  wrote  these  Sciences  which  they  had <br/>found  in  Two  Pillars  of  stone,  thatt  they  might  be  found  after  the  Flood.  The  one  stone  was  called <br/>Marbell&#x2014;cannott  burn  with  Fire,  and  the  other  was  called  Laturus  [brass?],  thatt  cannott  drown  in <br/>the  Water.&quot;  The  author  of  this  Constitution  there  upon  declares  that  one  of  these  pillars  was  later <br/>discovered  by  Hermes,  who  communicated  to  mankind  the  secrets  thereon  inscribed. <br/><br/>In  his  Antiquities  of  the  Jews,  Josephus  writes  that  Adam  had  forewarned  his  descendants  that  sinful <br/>humanity  would  be  destroyed  by  a  deluge.  In  order  to  preserve  their  science  and  philosophy,  the <br/>children  of  Seth  there  fore  raised  two  pillars,  one  of  brick  and  the  other  of  stone,  on  which  were <br/>inscribed  the  keys  to  their  knowledge.  The  Patriarch  Enoch&#x2014;whose  name  means  the  Initiator&#x2014; is <br/>evidently  a  personification  of  the  sun,  since  he  lived  365  years.  He  also  constructed  an  underground <br/>temple  consisting  of  nine  vaults,  one  beneath  the  other,  placing  in  the  deepest  vault  a  triangular  tablet <br/>of  gold  bearing  upon  it  the  absolute  and  ineffable  Name  of  Deity.  According  to  some  accounts,  Enoch <br/>made  two  golden  deltas.  The  larger  he  placed  upon  the  white  cubical  altar  in  the  lowest  vault  and  the <br/>smaller  he  gave  into  the  keeping  of  his  son,  Methuseleh,  who  did  the  actual  construction  work  of  the <br/>brick  chambers  according  to  the  pattern  revealed  to  his  father  by  the  Most  High.  In  the  form  and <br/>arrangement  of  these  vaults  Enoch  epitomized  the  nine  spheres  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  and  the  nine <br/>sacred  strata  of  the  earth  through  which  the  initiate  must  pass  to  reach  the  flaming  Spirit  dwelling  in <br/>its  central  core. <br/><br/>According  to  Freemasonic  symbolism,  Enoch,  fearing  that  all  knowledge  of  the  sacred  Mysteries <br/>would  be  lost  at  the  time  of  the  Deluge,  erected  the  two  columns  mentioned  in  the  quotation.  Upon <br/>the  metal  column  in  appropriate  allegorical  symbols  he  engraved  the  secret  reaching  and  upon  the <br/>marble  column  placed  an  inscription  stating  that  a  short  distance  away  a  priceless  treasure  would  be <br/>discovered  in  a  subterranean  vault.  After  having  thus  faithfully  completed  his  labors,  Enoch  was <br/>translated  from  the  brow  Of  Mount  Moriah.  In  time  the  location  of  the  secret  vaults  was  lost,  but  after <br/>the  lapse  of  ages  there  came  another  builder&#x2014; an  initiate  after  the  order  of  Enoch&#x2014; and  he,  while <br/>laying  the  foundations  for  another  temple  to  the  Great  Architect  of  the  Universe,  discovered  the  long- <br/>lost  vaults  and  the  secrets  contained  within. <br/><br/>John  Leylande  was  appointed  by  King  Henry  VIII  to  go  through  the  archives  of  the  various  religious <br/>institutions  dissolved  by  the  king  and  remove  for  preservation  any  books  or  manuscripts  of  an <br/>important  character.  Among  the  documents  copied  by  Leylande  was  a  series  of  questions  and  answers <br/><br/><br/>concerning  the  mystery  of  Masonry  written  by  King  Henry  VI.  In  answer  to  the  question,  &quot;How  came <br/>Masonry  into  England?&quot;  the  document  States  that  Peter  Gower,  a  Grecian,  traveled  for  knowledge  in <br/>Egypt,  Syria,  and  every  land  where  the  Phcenicians  had  planted  Masonry;  winning  entrance  in  all <br/>lodges  of  Masons,  he  learned  much,  and  returning,  dwelt  in  Greater  Greece.  He  became  renowned  for <br/>his  wisdom,  formed  a  great  lodge  at  Groton,  and  made  many  Masons,  some  of  whom  journeyed  in <br/>France,  spreading  Masonry  there;  from  France  in  the  course  of  time  the  order  passed  into  England. <br/><br/>To  even  the  superficial  student  of  the  subject  it  must  be  evident  that  the  name  of  Peter  Gower,  the <br/>Grecian,  is  merely  an  Anglicized  form  of  Pythagoras;  consequently  Groton,  where  he  formed  his <br/>lodge,  is  easily  identified  with  Crotona.  A  link  is  thus  established  between  the  philosophic  Mysteries <br/>of  Greece  and  mediaeval  Freemasonry.  In  his  notes  on  King  Henry's  questions  and  answers,  William <br/>Preston  enlarges  upon  the  vow  of  secrecy  as  it  was  practiced  by  the  ancient  initiates.  On  the  authority <br/>of  Pliny  he  describes  how  Anaxarchus,  having  been  imprisoned  in  order  to  extort  from  him  some  of <br/>the  secrets  with  which  he  had  been  entrusted,  bit  out  his  own  tongue  and  threw  it  in  the  face  of <br/>Nicocreon,  the  tyrant  of  Cyprus.  Preston  adds  that  the  Athenians  revered  a  brazen  statue  that  was <br/>represented  without  a  tongue  to  denote  the  sanctity  with  which  they  regarded  their  oath-bound <br/>secrets.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that,  according  to  King  Henry's  manuscript.  Masonry  had  its  origin  in <br/>the  East  and  was  the  carrier  of  the  arts  and  sciences  of  civilization  to  the  primitive  humanity  of  the <br/>western  nations. <br/><br/>Conspicuous  among  the  symbols  of  Freemasonry  are  the  seven  liberal  arts  and  sciences.  By  grammar <br/>man  is  taught  to  express  in  noble  and  adequate  language  his  innermost  thoughts  and  ideals;  by <br/>rhetoric  he  is  enabled  to  conceal  his  ideals  under  the  protecting  cover  of  ambiguous  language  and <br/>figures  of  speech;  by  logic  he  is  trained <br/><br/><br/>THE  MYSTERY  OF  THE  MACROCOSM. <br/><br/><br/>Redrawn  from  Cesariano's  Edition  ofVitinivius. <br/><br/><br/>Summarizing  the  relationship  between  the  human  body  and  the  theory  of  architectonics,  Vitruvius  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;Since  nature  has  designed  the  human  body  so  that  its  members  are  duly  proportioned  to  the  frame  as  a  whole,  it  appears <br/>that  the  ancients  had  good  reason  for  their  rule,  that  in  perfect  building  the  different  members  must  be  in  exact <br/>symmetrical  relations  to  the  whole  general  scheme.  Hence,  while  transmitting  to  us  the  proper  arrangements  for  buildings <br/>of  all  kinds,  they  were  particularly  careful  to  do  so  in  the  case  of  temples  of  the  gods,  buildings  in  which  merits  and  faults <br/>usually  last  forever.  *  *  *  Therefore,  if  it  is  agreed  that  number  was  found  out  from  the  human  fingers,  and  that  there  is  a <br/>symmetrical  correspondent  between  the  members  separately  and  the  entire  form  of  the  body,  in  accordance  with  a  certain <br/>part  selected  as  standard,  we  can  have  nothing  but  respect  for  those  who,  in  constructing  temples  of  the  immortal  gods, <br/>have  so  arranged  the  members  of  the  works  that  both  the  separate  parts  and  the  whole  design  may  harmonize  in  their <br/>proportions  and  symmetry.&quot;  (See  The  Ten  Books  on  Architecture) <br/><br/>By  some  it  is  believed  that  St.  Paul  was  initiated  into  the  Dionysiac  Mysteries,  for  in  the  tenth  verse  of  the  third  chapter  of <br/>First  Corinthians  he  calls  himself  a  &quot;master-builder&quot;  or  adept:  &quot;According  to  the  grace  of  God  which  is  given  into  me,  as  a <br/>wise  master-builder,  I  have  laid  the  foundation  and  another  buildeth  thereon.  &quot;  As  survivals  of  the  ancient  Dionysiac  rites, <br/>the  two  diagrams  of  Cesariano,  accompanying  this  chapter  are  of  incalculable  value  to  the  modern  mystic  architect. <br/><br/>p.  174 <br/><br/>in  the  organization  of  the  intellectual  faculties  with  which  he  has  been  endowed;  by  arithmetic  he  not <br/>only  is  instructed  in  the  mystery  of  universal  order  but  also  gains  the  key  to  multitude,  magnitude, <br/>and  proportion;  by  geometry  he  is  inducted  into  the  mathematics  of  form,  the  harmony  and  rhythm <br/>of  angles,  and  the  philosophy  of  organization;  by  music  he  is  reminded  that  the  universe  is  founded <br/>upon  the  laws  of  celestial  harmonics  and  that  harmony  and  rhythm  are  all-pervading;  by  astronomy <br/>he  gains  an  understanding  of  the  immensities  of  time  and  space,  of  the  proper  relationship  between <br/>himself  and  the  universe,  and  of  the  awesomeness  of  that  Unknown  Power  which  is  driving  the <br/>countless  stars  of  the  firmament  through  illimitable  space.  Equipped  with  the  knowledge  conferred  by <br/>familiarity  with  the  liberal  arts  and  sciences,  the  studious  Freemason  therefore  finds  himself <br/>confronted  by  few  problems  with  which  he  cannot  cope. <br/><br/>THE  DIONYSIAC  ARCHITECTS <br/><br/>The  most  celebrated  of  the  ancient  fraternities  of  artisans  was  that  of  the  Dionysiac  Architects.  This <br/>organization  was  composed  exclusively  of  initiates  of  the  Bacchus-Dionysos  cult  and  was  peculiarly <br/>consecrated  to  the  science  of  building  and  the  art  of  decoration.  Acclaimed  as  being  the  custodians  of <br/>a  secret  and  sacred  knowledge  of  architectonics,  its  members  were  entrusted  with  the  design  and <br/>erection  of  public  buildings  and  monuments.  The  superlative  excellence  of  their  handiwork  elevated <br/>the  members  of  the  guild  to  a  position  of  surpassing  dignity;  they  were  regarded  as  the  master <br/>craftsmen  of  the  earth.  Because  of  the  first  dances  held  in  honor  of  Dionysos,  he  was  considered  the <br/>founder  and  patron  of  the  theater,  and  the  Dionysians  specialized  in  the  construction  of  buildings <br/>adapted  for  the  presentation  of  dramatic  performances.  In  the  circular  or  semicircular  orchestra  they <br/>invariably  erected  an  altar  to  ^Eschylus,  the  famous  Greek  poet,  that  while  appearing  in  one  of  his <br/>own  plays  he  was  suspected  by  a  mob  of  angry  spectators  of  revealing  one  of  the  profound  secrets  of <br/>the  Mysteries  and  was  forced  to  seek  refuge  at  the  altar  of  Dionysos. <br/><br/>So  carefully  did  the  Dionysiac  Architects  safeguard  the  secrets  of  their  craft  that  only  fragmentary <br/>records  exist  of  their  esoteric  teachings.  John  A.  Weisse  thus  sums  up  the  meager  data  available <br/>concerning  the  order: <br/><br/>&quot;They  made  their  appearance  certainly  not  later  than  1000  B.C.,  and  appear  to  have  enjoyed <br/>particular  privileges  and  immunities.  They  also  possessed  secret  means  of  recognition,  and  were <br/>bound  together  by  special  ties  only  known  to  themselves.  The  richer  of  this  fraternity  were  bound  to <br/>provide  for  their  poorer  brethren.  They  were  divided  into  communities,  governed  by  a  Master  and <br/>Wardens,  and  called  yuvoiKiai  (connected  houses).  They  held  a  grand  festival  annually,  and  were  held <br/>in  high  esteem.  Their  ceremonials  were  regarded  as  sacred.  It  has  been  claimed  that  Solomon,  at  the <br/><br/><br/>instance  of  Hiram,  King  of  Tyre,  employed  them  at  his  temple  and  palaces.  They  were  also  employed <br/><br/>at  the  construction  of  the  Temple  of  Diana  at  Ephesus.  They  had  means  of  intercommunication  all <br/>over  the  then  known  world,  and  from  them,  doubtless,  sprang  the  guilds  of  the  Traveling  Masons <br/>known  in  the  Middle  Ages.&quot;  (See  The  Obelisk  and  Freemasonry.) <br/><br/>The  fraternity  of  the  Dionysiac  Architects  spread  throughout  all  of  Asia  Minor,  even  reaching  Egypt <br/>and  India.  They  established  themselves  in  nearly  all  the  countries  bordering  on  the  Mediterranean, <br/>and  with  the  rise  of  the  Roman  Empire  found  their  way  into  Central  Europe  and  even  into  England. <br/>The  most  stately  and  enduring  buildings  in  Constantinople,  Rhodes,  Athens,  and  Rome  were  erected <br/>by  these  inspired  craftsmen.  One  of  the  most  illustrious  of  their  number  was  Vitnivius,  the  great <br/>architect,  renowned  as  the  author  of  De  Architectura  Libri  Decern.  In  the  various  sections  of  his  book <br/>Vitruvius  gives  several  hints  as  to  the  philosophy  underlying  the  Dionysiac  concept  of  the  principle  of <br/>symmetry  applied  to  the  science  of  architecture,  as  derived  from  a  consideration  of  the  proportions <br/>established  by  Nature  between  the  parts  and  members  of  the  human  body.  The  following  extract  from <br/>Vitruvius  on  the  subject  of  symmetry  is  representative: <br/><br/>&quot;The  design  of  a  temple  depends  on  symmetry,  the  principles  of  which  must  be  most  carefully <br/>observed  by  the  architect.  They  are  due  to  proportion,  in  dvaXoyia.  Proportion  is  a  correspondence <br/>among  the  measures  of  the  members  of  an  entire  work,  and  of  the  whole  to  a  certain  part  selected  as <br/>standard.  From  this  result  the  principles  of  symmetry.  Without  symmetry  and  proportion  there  can <br/>be  no  principles  in  the  design  of  any  temple;  that  is,  if  there  is  no  precise  relation  between  its <br/>members,  as  in  the  case  of  those  of  a  well  shaped  man.  For  the  human  body  is  so  designed  by  nature <br/>that  the  face,  from  the  chin  to  the  top  of  the  forehead  and  the  lowest  roots  of  the  hair,  is  a  tenth  part <br/>of  the  whole  height;  the  open  hand  from  the  wrist  to  the  tip  of  the  middle  finger  is  just  the  same;  the <br/>head  from  the  chin  to  the  crown  is  an  eighth,  and  with  the  neck  and  shoulder  from  the  top  of  the <br/>breast  to  the  lowest  roots  of  the  hair  is  a  sixth;  from  the  middle  of  the  breast  to  the  summit  of  the <br/>crown  is  a  fourth.  If  we  take  the  height  of  the  face  itself,  the  distance  from  the  bottom  of  the  chin  to <br/>the  under  side  of  the  nostrils  [and  from  that  point]  to  a  line  between  the  eyebrows  is  the  same;  from <br/>there  to  the  lowest  roots  of  the  hair  is  also  a  third,  comprising  the  forehead.  The  length  of  the  foot  is <br/>one  sixth  of  the  height  of  the  body;  of  the  forearm,  one  fourth;  and  the  breadth  of  the  breast  is  also <br/>one  fourth.  The  other  members,  too,  have  their  own  symmetrical  proportions,  and  it  was  by <br/>employing  them  that  the  famous  painters  and  sculptors  of  antiquity  attained  to  great  and  endless <br/>renown.&quot; <br/><br/>The  edifices  raised  by  the  Dionysiac  Builders  were  indeed  &quot;sermons  in  stone.&quot;  Though  unable  to <br/>comprehend  fully  the  cosmic  principles  thus  embodied  in  these  masterpieces  of  human  ingenuity  and <br/>industry,  even  the  uninitiated  were  invariably  overwhelmed  by  the  sense  of  majesty  and  symmetry <br/>resulting  from  the  perfect  coordination  of  pillars,  spans,  arches,  and  domes.  By  variations  in  the <br/>details  of  size,  material,  type,  arrangement,  ornamentation,  and  color,  these  inspired  builders <br/>believed  it  possible  to  provoke  in  the  nature  of  the  onlooker  certain  distinct  mental  or  emotional <br/>reactions.  Vitruvius,  for  example,  describes  the  disposition  of  bronze  vases  about  a  room  so  as  to <br/>produce  certain  definite  changes  in  the  tone  and  quality  of  the  human  voice.  In  like  manner,  each <br/>chamber  in  the  Mysteries  through  which  the  candidate  passed  had  its  own  peculiar  acoustics.  Thus  in <br/>one  chamber  the  voice  of  the  priest  was  amplified  until  his  words  caused  the  very  room  to  vibrate, <br/>while  in  another  the  voice  was  diminished  and  softened  to  such  a  degree  that  it  sounded  like  the <br/>distant  tinkling  of  silver  bells.  Again,  in  some  of  the  underground  passageways  the  candidate  was <br/>apparently  bereft  of  the  power  of  speech,  for  though  he  shouted  at  the  top  of  his  voice  not  even  a <br/>whisper  was  audible  to  his  ears.  After  progressing  a  few  feet,  however,  he  would  discover  that  his <br/>softest  sigh  would  be  reechoed  a  hundred  times. <br/><br/>The  supreme  ambition  of  the  Dionysiac  Architects  was  the  construction  of  buildings  which  would <br/>create  distinct  impressions  consistent  with  the  purpose  for  which  the  structure  itself  was  designed.  In <br/>common  with  the  Pythagoreans,  they  believed  it  possible  by  combinations  of  straight  lines  and  curves <br/><br/><br/>to  induce  any  desired  mental  attitude  or  emotion.  They  labored,  therefore,  to  the  end  of  producing  a <br/>building  perfectly  harmonious  with  the  structure  of  the  universe  itself.  They  may  have  even  believed <br/>that  an  edifice  so  constructed  because  it  was  in  no  respect  at  variance  with  any  existing  reality  would <br/>not  be  subject  to  dissolution  but  would  endure  throughout  the  span  of  mortal  time.  As  a  logical <br/>deduction  from  their  philosophic  trend  of  thought,  such  a  building&#x2014;en  rapport  with  Cosmos&#x2014;would <br/>also  have  become  an  oracle.  Certain  early  works  on  magical  philosophy  hint  that  the  Ark  of  the <br/>Covenant  was  oracular  in  character  because  of  specially  prepared  chambers  in  its  interior.  These  by <br/>their  shape  and  arrangement  were  so  attuned  to  the  vibrations  of  the  invisible  world  that  they  caught <br/>and  amplified  the  voices  of  the  ages  imprinted  upon  and  eternally  existent  in  the  substance  of  the <br/>astral  light. <br/><br/>Unskilled  in  these  ancient  subtleties  of  their  profession,  modern  architects  often  create  architectural <br/>absurdities  which  would  cause  their  creators  to  blush  with  shame  did  they  comprehend  their  actual <br/>symbolic  import.  Thus,  phallic  emblems  are  strewn  in  profusion  among  the  adornments  of  banks, <br/>office  buildings,  and  department  stores.  Christian  churches  also  may  be  surmounted  with  Brahmin  or <br/>Mohammedan  domes  or  be  designed  in  a  style  suitable  for  a  Jewish  synagogue  or  a  Greek  temple  to <br/>Pluto.  These  incongruities  maybe  considered  trivial  in  importance  by  the  modem  designer,  but  to  the <br/>trained  psychologist  the  purpose  for  which  a  building  was  erected  is  frustrated  in  large  measure  by <br/>the  presence  of  such  architectural  discordances.  Vitruvius  thus  defines  the  principle  of  propriety  as <br/>conceived  and  applied  by  the  Dionysians: <br/><br/>&quot;Propriety  is  that:  perfection  of  style  which  comes  when  a  work  is  authoritatively  constructed  on <br/>approved  principles.  It  arises  from  prescription  (Greek  Ge^aTioiiw),  from  usage,  or  from  nature.  From <br/>prescription,  in  the  case  of  hypeethral  edifices,  open  to  the  sky,  in  honour  of  Jupiter  Lightning,  the <br/>Heaven,  the  Sun,  or  the  Moon:  for  these  are  gods  whose  semblances  and  manifestations  we  behold <br/>before  our  very  eyes  in  the  sky  when  it  is  cloudless  and  bright.  The  temples  of  Minerva,  Mars,  and <br/>Hercules  will  be  Doric,  since  the  virile  strength  of  these  gods  makes  daintiness  entirely  inappropriate <br/>to  their  houses.  In  temples  to  Venus,  Flora,  Proserpine,  Spring- Water,  and  the  Nymphs,  the <br/>Corinthian  order  will  be  found  to  have  peculiar  significance,  because  these  are  delicate  divinities  and <br/>so  its  rather  slender  outlines,  its  flowers,  leaves,  and  ornamental  volutes  will  lend  propriety  where  it <br/>is  due.  The  construction  of  temples  of  the  Ionic  order  to  Juno,  Diana,  Father  Bacchus,  and  the  other <br/>gods  of  that  kind,  will  be  in  keeping  with  the  middle  position  which  they  hold;  for  the  building  of  such <br/>will  be  an  appropriate  combination  of  the  severity  of  the  Doric  and  the  delicacy  of  the  Corinthian.&quot; <br/><br/>p-175 <br/><br/>In  describing  the  societies  of  Ionian  artificers,  Joseph  Da  Costa  declares  the  Dionysiac  rites  to  have <br/>been  founded  upon  the  science  of  astronomy,  which  by  the  initiates  of  this  order  was  correlated  to  the <br/>builder's  art.  In  various  documents  dealing  with  the  origin  of  architecture  are  found  hints  to  the  effect <br/>that  the  great  buildings  erected  by  these  initiated  craftsmen  were  based  upon  geometrical  patterns <br/>derived  from  the  constellations.  Thus,  a  temple  might  be  planned  according  to  the  constellation  of <br/>Pegasus  or  a  court  of  judgment  modeled  after  the  constellation  of  the  Scales.  The  Dionysians  evolved <br/>a  peculiar  code  by  which  they  were  able  to  communicate  with  one  another  in  the  dark  and  both  the <br/>symbols  and  the  terminology  of  their  guild  were  derived,  in  the  main,  from  the  elements  of <br/>architecture. <br/><br/>While  stigmatized  as  pagans  by  reason  of  their  philosophic  principles,  it  is  noteworthy  that  these <br/>Dionysiac  craftsmen  were  almost  universally  employed  in  the  erection  of  early  Christian  abbeys  and <br/>cathedrals,  whose  stones  even  to  this  very  day  bear  distinguishing  marks  and  symbols  cut  into  their <br/>surfaces  by  these  illustrious  builders.  Among  the  ornate  carvings  upon  the  fronts  of  great  churches  of <br/>the  Old  World  are  frequently  found  representations  of  compasses,  squares,  rules,  mallets,  and <br/>clusters  of  builders'  tools  skillfully  incorporated  into  mural  decorations  and  even  placed  in  the  hands <br/>of  the  effigies  of  saints  and  prophets  standing  in  exalted  niches.  A  great  mystery  was  contained  in  the <br/><br/><br/>ancient  portals  of  the  Cathedral  Of  Notre  Dame  which  were  destroyed  during  the  French  Revolution, <br/><br/>for  among  their  carvings  were  numerous  Rosicrucian  and  Masonic  emblems;  and  according  to  the <br/>records  preserved  by  alchemists  who  studied  their  bas-reliefs,  the  secret  processes  for  metallic <br/>transmutation  were  set  forth  in  their  grotesque  yet  most  significant  figures. <br/><br/>The  checkerboard  floor  upon  which  the  modern  Freemasonic  lodge  stands  is  the  old  tracing  board  of <br/>the  Dionysiac  Architects,  and  while  the  modern  organization  is  no  longer  limited  to  workmen's  guilds <br/>it  still  preserves  in  its  symbols  the  metaphysical  doctrines  of  the  ancient  society  of  which  it  is <br/>presumably  the  outgrowth.  The  investigator  of  the  origin  of  Freemasonic  symbolism  who  desires  to <br/>trace  the  development  of  the  order  through  the  ages  will  find  a  practical  suggestion  in  the  following <br/>statement  of  Charles  W.  Heckethorn: <br/><br/>&quot;But  considering  that  Freemasonry  is  a  tree  the  roots  of  which  spread  through  so  many  soils,  it <br/>follows  that  traces  thereof  must  be  found  in  its  fruit;  that  its  language  and  ritual  should  retain  much <br/>of  the  various  sects  and  institutions  it  has  passed  through  before  arriving  at  their  present  state,  and  in <br/>Masonry  we  meet  with  Indian,  Egyptian,  Jewish,  and  Christian  ideas,  terms  therefrom  the  supreme <br/>ambition  of  their  craft  and  symbols.&quot;  (See  The  Secret  Societies  of  All  Ages  and  Countries.) <br/><br/>The  Roman  Collegia  of  skilled  architects  were  apparently  a  subdivision  of  the  greater  Ionian  body, <br/>their  principles  and  organization  being  practically  identical  with  the  older  Ionian  institution.  It  has <br/>been  suspected  that  the  Dionysians  also  profoundly  influenced  early  Islamic  culture,  for  part  of  their <br/>symbolism  found  its  way  into  the  Mysteries  of  the  dervishes.  At  one  time  the  Dionysians  referred  to <br/>themselves  as  Sons  of  Solomon,  and  one  of  the  most  important  of  their  symbols  was  the  Seal  of <br/>Solomon&#x2014;two  interlaced  triangles.  This  motif  is  frequently  seen  in  conspicuous  parts  of <br/>Mohammedan  mosques.  The  Knights  Templars&#x2014;who  were  suspected  of  anything  and  everything&#x2014; are <br/>believed  to  have  contacted  these  Dionysiac  artificers  and  to  have  introduced  many  of  their  symbols <br/>and  doctrines  into  mediseval  Europe.  But  Freemasonry  most  of  all  owes  to  the  Dionysiac  cult  the  great <br/>mass  of  its  symbols  and  rituals  which  are  related  to  the  science  of  architecture.  From  these  ancient <br/>and  illustrious  artisans  it  also  received  the  legacy  of  the  unfinished  Temple  of  Civilization-that  vast, <br/>invisible  structure  upon  which  these  initiated  builders  have  labored  continuously  since  the  inception <br/>of  their  fraternity.  This  mighty  edifice,  which  has  fallen  and  been  rebuilt  time  after  time  but  whose <br/>foundations  remain  unmoved,  is  the  true  Everlasting  House  of  which  the  temple  on  the  brow  of <br/>Mount  Moriah  was  but  an  impermanent  symbol. <br/><br/>Aside  from  the  operative  aspect  of  their  order,  the  Dionysiac  Architects  had  a  speculative  philosophic <br/>code.  Human  society  they  considered  as  a  rough  and  untrued  ashlar  but  lately  chiseled  from  the <br/>quarry  of  elemental  Nature.  This  crude  block  was  the  true  object  upon  which  these  skilled  craftsmen <br/>labored&#x2014; polishing  it,  squaring  it,  and  with  the  aid  of  fine  carvings  transforming  it  into  a  miracle  of <br/>beauty.  While  mystics  released  their  souls  from  the  bondage  of  matter  by  meditation  and <br/>philosophers  found  their  keenest  joy  in  the  profundities  of  thought,  these  master  workmen  achieved <br/>liberation  from  the  Wheel  of  Life  and  Death  by  learning  to  swing  their  hammers  with  the  same <br/>rhjrthm  that  moves  the  swirling  forces  of  Cosmos.  They  venerated  the  Deity  under  the  guise  of  a  Great <br/>Architect  and  Master  Craftsman  who  was  ever  gouging  rough  ashlars  from  the  fields  of  space  and <br/>truing  them  into  universes.  The  Dionysians  affirmed  constructiveness  to  be  the  supreme  expression <br/>of  the  soul,  and  attuning  themselves  with  the  ever-visible  constructive  natural  processes  going  on <br/>around  them,  believed  immortality  could  be  achieved  by  thus  becoming  a  part  of  the  creative  agencies <br/>of  Nature. <br/><br/>SOLOMON,  THE  PERSONIFICATION  OF  UNIVERSAL  WISDOM <br/><br/>The  name  Solomon  maybe  divided  into  three  syllables,  SOL-OM-ON,  symbolizing  light,  glory,  and <br/>truth  collectively  and  respectively.  The  Temple  of  Solomon  is,  therefore,  first  of  all  &quot;the  House  of <br/>Everlasting  Light,&quot;  its  earthly  symbol  being  the  temple  of  stone  on  the  brow  of  Mount  Moriah. <br/><br/><br/>According  to  the  Mystery  teachings,  there  are  three  Temples  of  Solomon&#x2014;as  there  are  three  Grand <br/><br/>Masters,  three  Witnesses,  and  three  Tabernacles  of  the  Transfiguration.  The  first  temple  is  the  Grand <br/>House  of  the  Universe,  in  the  midst  of  which  sits  the  sun  (SOL)  upon  his  golden  throne.  The  twelve <br/>signs  of  the  zodiac  as  Fellow-Craftsmen  gather  around  their  shining  lord.  Three  lights&#x2014;the  stellar,  the <br/>solar,  and  the  lunar&#x2014; illuminate  this  Cosmic  Temple.  Accompanied  by  his  retinue  of  planets,  moons, <br/>and  asteroids,  this  Divine  King  (SOLomon),  whose  glory  no  earthly  monarch  shall  ever  equal,  passes <br/>in  stately  pomp  down  the  avenues  of  space.  Whereas  CHiram  represents  the  active  physical  light  of <br/>the  sun,  SOLomon  signifies  its  invisible  but  all-powerful,  spiritual  and  intellectual  effulgency. <br/><br/>The  second  symbolic  temple  is  the  human  body-the  Little  House  made  in  the  image  of  the  Great <br/>Universal  House.  &quot;Know  ye  not,&quot;  asked  the  Apostle  Paul,  &quot;that  ye  are  the  temple  of  God,  and  that  the <br/>Spirit  of  God  dwell eth  in  you?&quot;  Freemasonry  within  a  temple  of  stone  cannot  be  other  than <br/>speculative,  but  Freemasonry  within  the  living  temple  of  the  body  is  operative.  The  third  symbolic <br/>temple  is  the  Soular  House,  an  invisible  structure,  the  comprehension  of  which  is  a  supreme <br/>Freemasonic  arcanum.  The  mystery  of  this  intangible  edifice  is  concealed  under  the  allegory  of  the <br/>Soma  Psuchicon,  or  Wedding  Garment  described  by  St.  Paul,  the  Robes  of  Glory  of  the  High  Priest  of <br/>Israel,  the  Yellow  Robe  of  the  Buddhist  monk,  and  the  Robe  of  Blue  and  Gold  to  which  Albert  Pike <br/>refers  in  his  Symbolism.  The  soul,  constructed  from  an  invisible  fiery  substance,  a  flaming  golden <br/>metal,  is  cast  by  the  Master  Workman,  CHiram  Abiff,  into  the  mold  of  clay  (the  physical  body)  and  is <br/>called  the  Molten  Sea.  The  temple  of  the  human  soul  is  built  by  three  Master  Masons  personifying <br/>Wisdom,  Love,  and  Service,  and  when  constructed  according  to  the  Law  of  Life  the  spirit  of  God <br/>dwells  in  the  Holy  Place  thereof.  The  Soular  Temple  is  the  true  Everlasting  House,  and  he  who  can <br/>raise <br/><br/><br/>THE  MYSTERY  OF  THE  MICROCOSM. <br/><br/><br/>Redrawn  from  Cesariano's  Edition  ofVitimvius. <br/><br/>Herein  is  depicted  the  mysterious  Word  of  Plato  which  was  crucified  in  space  before  the  foundation  of  the  world.  The <br/>anonymous  author  of  The  Canon  writes: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;The  Logos  or  soul  of  the  world,  according  to  Plato,  the  Greek  Hermes,  and  the  Christ,  according  to  the  Christian  Gnostics, <br/>are  all  one  and  the  same  as  the  Hebrew  Adam  Kadmon,  who  is  the  second  person  of  the  cabalistic  triad.  The  Cyllenian <br/>Hermes,  described  by  Hippolytus,  so  exactly  resembles  the  lesser  man  found  in  Cesariano's  edition  of  Vitruvius,  that  they <br/>may  be  justifiably  considered  to  be  identical.&quot; <br/><br/>After  relating  the  figure  to  Dionysus  because  of  the  vine  leaves  wound  in  the  hair,  the  same  writer  concludes:  &quot;Here  we <br/>have  clearly  and  distinctly  a  curious  survival  of  the  cosmic  deity  of  Greece,  copied  and  disfigured  by  the  crude <br/>draughtsmen  of  the  Middle  Ages,  but  faithfully  preserved,  and  recognizable  to  the  last.&quot;  Similar  figures  are  to  be  found  in <br/>Agrippa's  De  Occulta  Philosophia.  Like  Cesariano's  diagrams,  however,  the  key  given  for  their  interpretation  is  most <br/>inadequate.  Agrippa  declares  that,  being  a  type  of  the  lesser  world,  man  contains  in  himself  all  numbers,  measures, <br/>weights,  motions,  and  elements.  The  secret  doctrine  of  Freemasonry,  like  that  of  the  Dionysiac  Architects,  is  concerned <br/>primarily  with  the  effort  to  measure  or  estimate  philosophically  the  parts  and  proportions  of  the  microcosm,  so  that  by  the <br/>knowledge  derived  therefrom  the  supreme  ambition  of  their  craft  might  be  realized&#x2014;the  creation  of  a  perfect  man. <br/><br/>p.  176 <br/><br/>or  cast  it  is  a  Master  Mason  indeedl  The  best-informed  Masonic  writers  have  reahzed  that  Solomon's <br/>Temple  is  a  representation  in  miniature  of  the  Universal  Temple.  Concerning  this  point,  A.  E.  Waite, <br/>in  A  New  Encyclopaedia  of  Freemasonry,  writes:  &quot;It  is  macrocosmic  in  character,  so  that  the  Temple <br/>is  a  symbol  of  the  universe,  a  type  of  manifestation  itself.&quot; <br/><br/>Solomon,  the  Spirit  of  Universal  Illumination&#x2014;mental,  spiritual,  moral,  and  physical&#x2014;is  personified <br/>in  the  king  of  an  earthly  nation.  While  a  great  ruler  by  that  name  may  have  built  a  temple,  he  who <br/>considers  the  story  solely  from  its  historical  angle  will  never  clear  away  the  rubbish  that  covers  the <br/>secret  vaults.  The  rubbish  is  interpolated  matter  in  the  form  of  superficial  symbols,  allegories,  and <br/>degrees  which  have  no  legitimate  part  in  the  original  Freemasonic  Mysteries.  Concerning  the  loss  of <br/>the  true  esoteric  key  to  Masonic  secrets,  Albert  Pike  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;No  one  journeys  now  'from  the  high  place  of  Cabaon  to  the  threshing  floor  of  Oman  the  Yebusite,' <br/>nor  has  seen,  'his  Master,  clothed  in  blue  and  gold;'  nor  are  apprentices  and  Fellow-crafts  any  longer <br/>paid  at  their  respective  Columns;  nor  is  the  Master's  working  tool  the  Tracing  Board,  nor  does  he  use <br/>in  his  work  'Chalk,  Charcoal,  and  an  Earthen  Vessel,'  nor  does  the  Apprentice,  becoming  a  Fellow <br/>Craft,  pass  from  the  square  to  the  compass;  for  the  meanings  of  these  phrases  as  symbols  have  long <br/>been  lost.&quot; <br/><br/>According  to  the  ancient  Rabbins,  Solomon  was  an  initiate  of  the  Mystery  schools  and  the  temple <br/>which  he  built  was  actually  a  house  of  initiation  containing  amass  of  pagan  philosophic  and  phallic <br/>emblems.  The  pomegranates,  the  palm-headed  columns,  the  Pillars  before  the  door,  the  Babylonian <br/>cherubim,  and  the  arrangement  of  the  chambers  and  draperies  all  indicate  the  temple  to  have  been <br/>patterned  after  the  sanctuaries  of  Egypt  and  Atlantis.  Isaac  Myer,  in  The  Qabbalah,  makes  the <br/>following  observation: <br/><br/>&quot;The  pseudo-Clement  of  Rome,  writes:  'God  made  man  male  and  female.  The  male  is  Christ:  the <br/>female,  the  Church.'  The  Qabbalists  called  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  mother,  and  the  Church  of  Israel,  the <br/>Daughter.  Solomon  engraved  on  the  walls  of  his  Temple,  likenesses  of  the  male  and  female  principles, <br/>to  adumbrate  this  mystery;  such,  it  is  said,  were  the  figures  of  the  cherubim.  This  was,  however,  not  in <br/>obedience  to  the  words  of  the  Thorah.  They  were  symbolical  of  the  Upper,  the  spiritual,  the  former  or <br/>maker,  positive  or  male,  and  the  Lower,  the  passive,  the  negative  or  female,  formed  or  made  by  the <br/>first.&quot; <br/><br/>Masonry  came  to  Northern  Africa  and  Asia  Minor  from  the  lost  continent  of  Atlantis,  not  under  its <br/>present  name  but  rather  under  the  general  designation  Sun  and  Fire  Worship.  The  ancient  Mysteries <br/>did  not  cease  to  exist  when  Christianity  became  the  world's  most  powerful  religion.  Great  Pan  did  not <br/>die!  Freemasonry  is  the  proof  of  his  survival.  The  pre-Christian  Mysteries  simply  assumed  the <br/>symbolism  of  the  new  faith,  perpetuating  through  its  emblems  and  allegories  the  same  truths  which <br/><br/><br/>had  been  the  property  of  the  wise  since  the  beginning  of  the  world.  There  is  no  true  explanation, <br/><br/>therefore,  for  Christian  symbols  save  that  which  is  concealed  within  pagan  philosophy.  Without  the <br/>mysterious  keys  carried  by  the  hierophants  of  the  Egyptian,  Brahmin,  and  Persian  cults  the  gates  of <br/>Wisdom  cannot  be  opened.  Consider  with  reverent  spirit,  therefore,  the  sublime  allegory  of  the <br/>Temple  and  its  Builders,  realizing  that  beneath  its  literal  interpretation  lies  hidden  a  Royal  Secret. <br/><br/>According  to  the  Talmudic  legends,  Solomon  understood  the  mysteries  of  the  Qabbalah.  He  was  also <br/>an  alchemist  and  a  necromancer,  being  able  to  control  the  deemons,  and  from  them  and  other <br/>inhabitants  of  the  invisible  worlds  he  secured  much  of  his  wisdom.  In  his  translation  of  Clavicula <br/>Salomonis,  or  The  Key  of  Solomon  the  King,  a  work  presumably  setting  forth  the  magical  secrets <br/>gathered  by  Solomon  and  used  by  him  in  the  conjuration  of  spirits  and  which,  according  to  Frank  C. <br/>Higgins,  contains  many  sidelights  on  Masonic  initiatory  rituals,  S.  L.  MacGregor-Mathers  recognizes <br/>the  probability  that  King  Solomon  was  a  magician  in  the  fullest  sense  of  that  word.  &quot;I  see  no  reason  to <br/>doubt,&quot;  he  affirms,  &quot;the  tradition  which  assigns  the  authorship  of  the  'Key'  to  King  Solomon,  for <br/>among  others  Josephus,  the  Jewish  historian,  especially  mentions  the  magical  works  attributed  to <br/>that  monarch;  this  is  confirmed  by  many  Eastern  traditions,  and  his  magical  skill  is  frequently <br/>mentioned  in  the  Arabian  Nights.&quot; <br/><br/>Concerning  Solomon's  supernatural  powers,  Josephus  writes  in  his  Eighth  Book  of  the  Antiquities  of <br/>the  Jews: <br/><br/>&quot;Now  the  sagacity  and  wisdom  which  God  had  bestowed  on  Solomon  was  so  great  that  he  exceeded <br/>the  ancients,  in  so  much  that  he  was  no  way  inferior  to  the  Egyptians,  who  are  said  to  have  been <br/>beyond  all  men  in  understanding;  *  *  *  God  also  enabled  him  to  learn  that  skill  which  expelled <br/>demons,  which  is  a  science  useful  and  sanative  to  him.  He  composed  such  incantations  also  by  which <br/>distempers  are  alleviated.  And  he  left  behind  him  the  manner  of  using  exorcisms,  by  which  they  drive <br/>away  demons,  so  that  they  never  return;  and  this  method  of  cure  is  of  great  force  unto  this  day.&quot; <br/><br/>The  medigeval  alchemists  were  convinced  that  King  Solomon  understood  the  secret  processes  of <br/>Hermes  by  means  of  which  it  was  possible  to  multiply  metals.  Dr.  Bacstrom  writes  that  the  Universal <br/>Spirit  (CHiram)  assisted  King  Solomon  to  build  his  temple,  because  Solomon  being  wise  in  the <br/>wisdom  of  alchemy  knew  how  to  control  this  incorporeal  essence  and,  setting  it  to  work  for  him, <br/>caused  the  invisible  universe  to  supply  him  with  vast  amounts  of  gold  and  silver  which  most  people <br/>believed  were  mined  by  natural  methods. <br/><br/>The  mysteries  of  the  Islamic  faith  are  now  in  the  keeping  of  the  dervishes&#x2014;men  who,  renouncing <br/>worldliness,  have  withstood  the  test  of  a  thousand  and  one  days  of  temptation.  Jelal-ud-din,  the  great <br/>Persian  Sufic  poet  and  philosopher,  is  accredited  with  having  founded  the  Order  of  Mevlevi,  or  the <br/>&quot;dancing  dervishes,&quot;  whose  movements  exoterically  signify  the  motions  of  the  celestial  bodies  and <br/>esoterically  result  in  the  establishment  of  a  rhythm  which  stimulates  the  centers  of  spiritual <br/>consciousness  within  the  dancer's  body. <br/><br/>&quot;According  to  the  mystical  canon,  there  are  always  on  earth  a  certain  number  of  holy  men  who  are <br/>admitted  to  intimate  communion  with  the  Deity.  The  one  who  occupies  the  highest  position  among <br/>his  contemporaries  is  called  the  'Axis'  (Qiitb)  or  'Pole'  of  his  time.  *  *  *  Subordinate  to  the  Qutb  are <br/>two  holy  beings  who  bear  the  title  of  'The  Faithful  Ones,'  and  are  assigned  places  on  his  right  and  left <br/>respectively.  Below  these  is  a  quartette  of  'Intermediate  Ones'  (Evtad);  and  on  successively  lower <br/>planes  ate  five  'Lights'  (Envar),  and  seven  'Very  Good'  (Akhyar).  The  next  rank  is  filled  by  forty <br/>'Absent  Ones'  (Rijal-i-ghaib),  also  termed  'Martyrs'  (Shuheda).  When  an  'Axis'  quits  this  earthly <br/>existence,  he  is  succeeded  by  the  'Faithful  One'  who  has  occupied  the  place  at  his  right  hand.  *  *  *  For <br/>to  these  holy  men,  who  also  bear  the  collective  titles  of  'Lords  of  Souls,'  and  'Directors,'  is  committed  a <br/>spiritual  supremacy  over  mankind  far  exceeding  the  temporal  authority  of  earthly  rulers.&quot;  (See <br/>Mysticism  and  Magic  in  Turkey,  by  L.  M.  J.  Garnett.) <br/><br/><br/>The  Axis  is  a  mysterious  individual  who,  unknown  and  unsuspected,  mingles  with  mankind  and  who, <br/>according  to  tradition,  has  his  favorite  seat  upon  the  roof  of  the  Caaba.  J.  P.  Brown,  in  The  Dervishes, <br/>gives  a  description  of  these  &quot;Master  Souls.&quot; <br/><br/>FREEMASONRY'S  PRICELESS  HERITAGE <br/><br/>The  sanctum  sanctorum  of  Freemasonry  is  ornamented  with  the  gnostic  jewels  of  a  thousand  ages;  its <br/>rituals  ring  with  the  divinely  inspired  words  of  seers  and  sages.  A  hundred  religious  have  brought <br/>their  gifts  of  wisdom  to  its  altar;  arts  and  sciences  unnumbered  have  contributed  to  its  symbolism. <br/>Freemasonry  is  a  world-wide  university,  teaching  the  liberal  arts  and  sciences  of  the  soul  to  all  who <br/>will  hearken  to  its  words.  Its  chairs  are  seats  of  learning  and  its  pillars  uphold  an  arch  of  universal <br/>education.  Its  trestleboards  are  inscribed  with  the  eternal  verities  of  all  ages  and  upon  those  who <br/>comprehend  its  sacred  depths  has  dawned  the  realization  that  within  the  Freemasonic  Mysteries  lie <br/>hidden  the  long-lost  arcana  sought  by  all  peoples  since  the  genesis  of  human  reason. <br/><br/>The  philosophic  power  of  Freemasonry  lies  in  its  symbols&#x2014;its  priceless  heritage  from  the  Mystery <br/>schools  of  antiquity.  In  a  letter  to  Robert  Freke  Gould,  Albert  Pike  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;It  began  to  shape  itself  to  my  intellectual  vision  into  something  more  imposing  and  majestic, <br/>solemnly  mysterious  and  grand.  It  seemed  to  me  like  the  Pyramids  in  their  loneliness,  in  whose  yet <br/>undiscovered  chambers  may  be  hidden,  for  the  enlightenment  of  coming  generations,  the  sacred <br/>books  of  the  Egyptians,  so  long  lost  to  the  world;  like  the  Sphynx  half  buried  in  the  desert.  In  its <br/>symbolism,  which  and  its  spirit  of  brotherhood  are  its  essence,  Freemasonry  is  more  ancient  than  any <br/>of  the  world's  living  religions.  It  has  the  symbols  and  doctrines  which,  older  than  himself,  Zarathustra <br/>inculcated;  and  ii  seemed  to  me  a  spectacle  sublime,  yet  pitiful&#x2014;the  ancient  Faith  of  our  ancestors <br/>holding  out  to  the  world  its  symbols  once  so  eloquent,  and  mutely  and  in  vain  asking  for  an <br/>interpreter.  And  so  I  came  at  last  to  see  that  the  true  greatness  and  majesty  of  Freemasonry  consist  in <br/>its  proprietorship  of  these  and  its  other  symbols;  and  that  its  symbolism  is  its  soul.&quot; <br/><br/>Though  the  temples  of  Thebes  and  Karnakbe  now  but  majestic  heaps  of  broken  and  time-battered <br/>stone,  the  spirit:  of  Egyptian  philosophy  still  marches  triumphant  through  the  centuries.  Though  the <br/>rock-hewn  sanctuaries  of  the  ancient  Brahmins  be  now  deserted  and  their  carvings  crumbled  into <br/>dust,  still  the  wisdom  of  the  Vedas  endures.  Though  the  oracles  be  silenced  and  the  House  of  the <br/>Mysteries  be  now  but  rows  of  ghostly  columns,  still  shines  the  spiritual  glory  of  Hellas  with  luster <br/>undiminished.  Though  Zoroaster,  Hermes,  Pj^hagoras,  Plato,  and  Aristotle  are  now  but  dim <br/>memories  in  a  world  once  rocked  by  the  transcendency  of  their  intellectual  genius,  still  in  the  mystic <br/>temple  of  Freemasonry  these  god-men  live  again  in  their  words  and  symbols;  and  the  candidate, <br/>passing  through  the  initiations,  feels  himself  face  to  face  with  these  illumined  hierophants  of  days <br/>long  past. <br/><br/><br/>p.  177 <br/><br/><br/>Mystic  Christianity <br/><br/>THE  true  story  of  the  life  of  Jesus  of  Nazareth  has  never  been  unfolded  to  the  world,  either  in  the <br/>accepted  Gospels  or  in  the  Apocrypha,  although  a  few  stray  hints  may  be  found  in  some  of  the <br/>commentaries  written  by  the  ante-Nicene  Fathers.  The  facts  concerning  His  identity  and  mission  are <br/>among  the  priceless  mysteries  preserved  to  this  day  in  the  secret  vaults  beneath  the  &quot;Houses  of  the <br/>Brethren.&quot;  To  a  few  of  the  Knights  Templars,  who  were  initiated  into  the  arcana  of  the  Druses, <br/>Nazarenes,  Essenes,  Johannites,  and  other  sects  still  inhabiting  the  remote  and  inaccessible <br/>fastnesses  of  the  Holy  Land,  part  of  the  strange  story  was  told.  The  knowledge  of  the  Templars <br/>concerning  the  early  history  of  Christianity  was  undoubtedly  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  their <br/>persecution  and  final  annihilation.  The  discrepancies  in  the  writings  of  the  early  Church  Fathers  not <br/>only  are  irreconcilable,  but  demonstrate  beyond  question  that  even  during  the  first  five  centuries  after <br/>Christ  these  learned  men  had  for  the  basis  of  their  writings  little  more  substantial  than  folklore  and <br/>hearsay.  To  the  easy  believer  everything  is  possible  and  there  are  no  problems.  The  unemotional <br/>person  in  search  of  facts,  however,  is  confronted  by  a  host  of  problems  with  uncertain  factors,  of <br/>which  the  following  are  typical: <br/><br/>According  to  popular  conception,  Jesus  was  crucified  during  the  thirty-third  year  of  His  life  and  in  the <br/>third  year  of  His  ministry  following  His  baptism.  About  A.D.  180,  St.  Irenaus,  Bishop  of  Lyons,  one  of <br/>the  most  eminent  of  the  ante-Nicene  theologians,  wrote  Against  Heresies,  an  attack  on  the  doctrines <br/>of  the  Gnostics.  In  this  work  Irenaeus  declared  upon  the  authority  of  the  Apostles  themselves  that <br/>Jesus  lived  to  old  age.  To  quote:  &quot;They,  however,  that  they  may  establish  their  false  opinion  regarding <br/>that  which  is  written,  'to  proclaim  the  acceptable  year  of  the  Lord,'  maintain  that  He  preached  for  one <br/>year  only,  and  then  suffered  in  the  twelfth  month.  [In  speaking  thus],  they  are  forgetful  of  their  own <br/>disadvantage,  destroying  His  whole  work,  and  robbing  Him  of  that  age  which  is  both  more  necessary <br/>and  more  honourable  than  any  other;  that  more  advanced  age,  I  mean,  during  which  also  as  a  teacher <br/>He  excelled  all  others.  For  how  could  He  have  had  His  disciples,  if  He  did  not  teach?  And  how  could <br/>He  have  taught,  unless  He  had  reached  the  age  of  a  Master?  For  when  He  came  to  be  baptised.  He <br/>had  not  yet  completed  His  thirtieth  year,  but  was  beginning  to  be  about  thirty  years  of  age  (for  thus <br/>Luke,  who  has  mentioned  His  years,  has  expressed  it:  'Now  Jesus  was,  as  it  were,  beginning  to  be <br/>thirty  years  old,'  when  He  came  to  receive  baptism);  and,  (according  to  these  men,)  He  preached  only <br/>one  year  reckoning  from  His  baptism.  On  completing  His  thirtieth  year  He  suffered,  being  in  fact  still <br/>a  young  man,  and  who  had  by  no  means  attained  to  advanced  age.  Now,  that  the  first  stage  of  early <br/>life  embraces  thirty  years,  and  that  this  extends  onward  to  the  fortieth  year,  every  one  will  admit;  but <br/>from  the  fortieth  and  fiftieth  year  a  man  begins  to  decline  towards  old  age,  which  Our  Lord  possessed <br/>while  He  still  fulfilled  the  office  of  a  Teacher,  even  as  the  Gospel  and  all  the  elders  testify;  those  who <br/>were  conversant  in  Asia  with  John,  the  disciple  of  the  Lord,  (affirming)  that  John  conveyed  to  them <br/>that  information.  And  he  remained  among  them  up  to  the  time  of  Trajan.  Some  of  them,  moreover, <br/>saw  not  only  John,  but  the  other  apostles  also,  and  heard  the  very  same  account  from  them,  and  bear <br/>testimony  as  to  the' (validity  of)  the  statement.  Whom  then  should  we  rather  believe?  Whether  such <br/>men  as  these,  or  Ptolemgeus,  who  never  saw  the  apostles,  and  who  never  even  in  his  dreams  attained <br/>to  the  slightest  trace  of  an  apostle?&quot; <br/><br/>Commenting  on  the  foregoing  passage,  Godfrey  Higgins  remarks  that  it  has  fortunately  escaped  the <br/>hands  of  those  destroyers  who  have  attempted  to  render  the  Gospel  narratives  consistent  by  deleting <br/>all  such  statements.  He  also  notes  that  the  doctrine  of  the  crucifixion  was  a  vexata  questio  among <br/>Christians  even  during  the  second  century.  &quot;The  evidence  of  Ireneeus,&quot;  he  says,  &quot;cannot  be  touched. <br/>On  every  principle  of  sound  criticism,  and  of  the  doctrine  of  probabilities,  it  is  unimpeachable.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>It  should  further  be  noted  that  Irenaeus  prepared  this  statement  to  contradict  another  apparently <br/><br/>current  in  his  time  to  the  effect  that  the  ministry  of  Jesus  lasted  but  one  year.  Of  all  the  early  Fathers, <br/>Irengeus,  writing  within  eighty  years  after  the  death  of  St.  John  the  Evangelist,  should  have  had <br/>reasonably  accurate  information.  If  the  disciples  themselves  related  that  Jesus  lived  to  advanced  age <br/>in  the  body,  why  has  the  mysterious  number  33  been  arbitrarily  chosen  to  symbolize  the  duration  of <br/>His  life?  Were  the  incidents  in  the  life  of  Jesus  purposely  altered  so  that  His  actions  would  fit  more <br/>closely  into  the  pattern  established  by  the  numerous  Savior-Gods  who  preceded  Him?  That  these <br/>analogies  were  recognized  and  used  as  a  leverage  in  converting  the  Greeks  and  Romans  is  evident <br/>from  a  perusal  of  the  writings  of  Justin  Martyr,  another  second-century  authority.  In  his  Apology, <br/>Justin  addresses  the  pagans  thus: <br/><br/>&quot;And  when  we  say  also  that  the  Word,  who  is  the  first-birth  of  God,  was  produced  without  sexual <br/>union,  and  that  He,  Jesus  Christ,  Our  Teacher,  was  crucified  and  died,  and  rose  again,  and  ascended <br/>into  heaven,  we  propound  nothing  different  from  what  you  believe  regarding  those  whom  you  esteem <br/>sons  of  Jupiter.  *  *  *  And  if  we  assert  that  the  Word  of  God  was  born  of  God  in  a  peculiar  manner, <br/>different  from  ordinary  generation,  let  this,  as  said  above,  be  no  extraordinary  thing  to  you,  who  say <br/>that  Mercury  is  the  angelic  word  of  God.  But  if  any  one  objects  that  He  was  crucified,  in  this  also  He  is <br/>on  a  par  with  those  reputed  sons  of  Jupiter  of  yours,  who  suffered  as  we  have  now  enumerated.&quot; <br/><br/>From  this  it  is  evident  that  the  first  missionaries  of  the  Christian  Church  were  far  more  willing  to <br/>admit  the  similarities  between  their  faith  and  the  faiths  of  the  pagans  than  were  their  successors  in <br/>later  centuries. <br/><br/>In  an  effort  to  solve  some  of  the  problems  arising  from  any  attempt  to  chronicle  accurately  the  life  of <br/>Jesus,  it  has  been  suggested  that  there  may  have  lived  in  Syria  at  that  time  two  or  more  religious <br/>teachers  bearing  the  name  Jesus,  Jehoshua  or  Joshua,  and  that  the  lives  of  these  men  may  have  been <br/>confused  in  the  Gospel  stories.  In  his  Secret  Sects  of  Syria  and  the  Lebanon,  Bernard  H.  Springett,  a <br/>Masonic  author,  quotes  from  an  early  book,  the  name  of  which  he  was  not  at  liberty  to  disclose <br/>because  of  its  connection  with  the  ritual  of  a  sect.  The  last  part  of  his  quotation  is  germane  to  the <br/>subject  at  hand: <br/><br/>&quot;But  Jehovah  prospered  the  seed  of  the  Essenians,  in  holiness  and  love,  for  many  generations.  Then <br/>came  the  chief  of  the  angels,  according  to  the  commandment  of  GOD,  to  raise  up  an  heir  to  the  Voice <br/>of  Jehovah.  And,  in  four  generations  more,  an  heir  was  born,  and  named  Joshua,  and  he  was  the  child <br/>of  Joseph  and  Mara,  devout  worshippers  of  Jehovah,  who  stood  aloof  from  all  other  people  save  the <br/>Essenians.  And  this  Joshua,  in  Nazareth,  reestablished  Jehovah,  and  restored  many  of  the  lost  rites <br/>and  ceremonies.  In  the  thirty-sixth  year  of  his  age  he  was  stoned  to  death  in  Jerusalem  *  *  *&quot; <br/><br/><br/>From  Jennings'  The  Rosicrucians,  Their  Rites  and  Mysteries. <br/><br/>According  to  tradition,  Arthur,  when  a  boy  of  fifteen,  was  crowned  King  of  Britain,  in  A.D.  516.  Soon  after  his  ascension  to <br/>the  throne  he  founded  the  Order  of  the  Knights  of  the  Round  Table  at  Windsor.  Thereafter  the  Knights  met  annually  at <br/>Carleon,  Winchester,  or  at  Camelot,  to  celebrate  Pentecost.  From  all  parts  of  Europe  came  the  brave  and  the  bold,  seeking <br/>admission  into  this  noble  order  of  British  knighthood.  Nobility,  virtue,  and  valor  were  its  requirements,  and  those <br/>possessing  these  qualities  to  a  marked  degree  were  welcomed  to  King  Arthur's  court  at  Camelot.  Having  gathered  the <br/>bravest  and  noblest  Knights  of  Europe  about  him.  King  Arthur  chose  twenty-four  who  excelled  all  the  others  in  daring  and <br/>integrity  and  formed  of  them  his  Circle  of  the  Round  Table.  According  to  legend,  each  of  these  Knights  was  so  great  in <br/>dignity  and  power  that  none  could  occupy  a  more  exalted  seat  than  another,  so  when  they  gathered  at  the  table  to <br/>celebrate  the  anniversary  of  their  foundation  it  was  necessary  to  use  a  round  table  that  all  might  occupy  chairs  of  equal <br/>importance. <br/><br/>While  it  is  probable  that  the  Order  of  the  Round  Table  had  its  distinctive  rituals  and  symbols,  the  knowledge  of  them  has <br/>not  survived  the  ages.  Elias  Ashmole,  in  his  volume  on  the  Order  of  the  Garter,  inserted  a  double-page  plate  showing  the <br/>insignia  of  all  the  orders  of  knighthood,  the  block  set  aside  for  the  symbol  of  the  Round  Table  being  left  blank.  The  chief <br/>reason  for  the  loss  of  the  symbolism  of  the  Round  Table  was  the  untimely  death  of  King  Arthur  upon  the  field  of  Kamblan <br/>(A.D.  542)  in  the  forty-first  year  of  his  life.  While  he  destroyed  his  bitter  enemy,  Mordred,  in  this  famous  battle,  it  cast  him <br/>not  only  his  own  life  but  the  lives  of  nearly  all  his  Knights  of  the  Round  Table,  who  died  defending  their  commander. <br/><br/>p.  178 <br/><br/>Within  the  last  century  several  books  have  been  published  to  supplement  the  meager  descriptions  in <br/>the  Gospels  of  Jesus  and  His  ministry.  In  some  instances  these  narratives  claim  to  be  founded  upon <br/>early  manuscripts  recently  discovered;  in  others,  upon  direct  spiritual  revelation.  Some  of  these <br/>writings  are  highly  plausible,  while  others  are  incredible.  There  are  persistent  rumors  that  Jesus <br/><br/><br/>visited  and  studied  in  both  Greece  and  India,  and  that  a  coin  struck  in  His  honor  in  India  during  the <br/>first  century  has  been  discovered.  Early  Christian  records  are  known  to  exist  in  Tibet,  and  the  monks <br/>of  a  Buddhist  monastery  in  Ceylon  still  preserve  a  record  which  indicates  that  Jesus  sojourned  with <br/>them  and  became  conversant  with  their  philosophy. <br/><br/>Although  early  Christianity  shows  every  evidence  of  Oriental  influence,  this  is  a  subject  the  modern <br/>church  declines  to  discuss.  If  it  is  ever  established  beyond  question  that  Jesus  was  an  initiate  of  the <br/>pagan  Greek  or  Asiatic  Mysteries,  the  effect  upon  the  more  conservative  members  of  the  Christian <br/>faith  is  likely  to  be  cataclysmic.  If  Jesus  was  God  incarnate,  as  the  solemn  councils  of  the  church <br/>discovered,  why  is  He  referred  to  in  the  New  Testament  as  &quot;called  of  God  an  high  prim  after  the  order <br/>of  Melchizedek&quot;?  The  words  &quot;after  the  order&quot;  make  Jesus  one  of  a  line  or  order  of  which  there  must <br/>have  been  others  of  equal  or  even  superior  dignity.  If  the  &quot;Melchizedeks&quot;  were  the  divine  or  priestly <br/>rulers  of  the  nations  of  the  earth  before  the  inauguration  of  the  system  of  temporal  rulers,  then  the <br/>statements  attributed  to  St.  Paul  would  indicate  that  Jesus  either  was  one  of  these  &quot;philosophic  elect&quot; <br/>or  was  attempting  to  reestablish  their  system  of  government.  It  will  be  remembered  that  Melchizedek <br/>also  performed  the  same  ceremony  of  the  drinking  of  wine  and  the  breaking  of  bread  as  did  Jesus  at <br/>the  Last  Supper. <br/><br/>George  Faber  declares  the  original  name  of  Jesus  was  Jescua  Hammassiah.  Godfrey  Higgins  has <br/>discovered  two  references,  one  in  the  Midrashjoholeth  and  the  other  in  the  Abodazara  (early  Jewish <br/>commentaries  on  the  Scriptures),  to  the  effect  that  the  surname  of  Joseph's  family  was  Panther,  for  in <br/>both  of  these  works  it  is  stated  that  a  man  was  healed  &quot;in  the  name  of  Jesus  ben  Panther.&quot;  The  name <br/>Panther  establishes  a  direct  connection  between  Jesus  and  Bacchus&#x2014;who  was  nursed  by  panthers <br/>and  is  sometimes  depicted  riding  either  on  one  of  these  animals  or  in  a  chariot  drawn  by  them.  The <br/>skin  of  the  panther  was  also  sacred  in  certain  of  the  Egyptian  initiatory  ceremonials.  The  monogram <br/>IHS,  now  interpreted  to  mean  lesus  Hominum  Salvator  (Jesus  Savior  of  Men),  is  another  direct  link <br/>between  the  Christian  and  the  Bacchic  rites.  IHS  is  derived  from  the  Greek  YHE,  which,  as  its <br/>numerical  value  (608)  signifies,  is  emblematic  of  the  sun  and  constituted  the  sacred  and  concealed <br/>name  of  Bacchus.  (See  The  Celtic  Druids  by  Godfrey  Higgins.)  The  question  arises.  Was  early  Roman <br/>Christianity  confused  with  the  worship  of  Bacchus  because  of  the  numerous  parallelisms  in  the  two <br/>faiths?  If  the  affirmative  can  be  proved,  many  hitherto  incomprehensible  enigmas  of  the  New <br/>Testament  will  be  solved. <br/><br/>It  is  by  no  means  improbable  that  Jesus  Himself  originally  propounded  as  allegories  the  cosmic <br/>activities  which  were  later  con  fused  with  His  own  life.  That  the  Xpioxog,  Christos,  represents  the <br/>solar  power  reverenced  by  every  nation  of  antiquity  cannot  be  controverted.  If  Jesus  revealed  the <br/>nature  and  purpose  of  this  solar  power  under  the  name  and  personality  of  Christos,  thereby  giving  to <br/>this  abstract  power  the  attributes  of  a  god-man.  He  but  followed  a  precedent  set  by  all  previous <br/>World-Teachers.  This  god-man,  thus  endowed  with  all  the  qualities  of  Deity,  signifies  the  latent <br/>divinity  in  every  man.  Mortal  man  achieves  deification  only  through  at-one-ment  with  this  divine  Self. <br/>Union  with  the  immortal  Self  constitutes  immortality,  and  he  who  finds  his  true  Self  is  therefore <br/>&quot;saved.&quot;  This  Christos,  or  divine  man  in  man,  is  man's  real  hope  of  salvation&#x2014;the  living  Mediator <br/>between  abstract  Deity  and  mortal  humankind.  As  Atys,  Adonis,  Bacchus,  and  Orpheus  in  all <br/>likelihood  were  originally  illumined  men  who  later  were  confused  with  the  symbolic  personages <br/>whom  they  created  as  personifications  of  this  divine  power,  so  Jesus  has  been  confused  with  the <br/>Christos,  or  god-man,  whose  wonders  He  preached.  Since  the  Christos  was  the  god-man  imprisoned <br/>in  every  creature,  it  was  the  first  duty  of  the  initiate  to  liberate,  or  &quot;resurrect, &quot;  this  Eternal  One  within <br/>himself.  He  who  attained  reunion  with  his  Christos  was  consequently  termed  a  Christian,  or <br/>Christened,  man. <br/><br/>One  of  the  most  profound  doctrines  of  the  pagan  philosophers  concerned  the  Universal  Savior-God <br/>who  lifted  the  souls  of  regenerated  men  to  heaven  through  His  own  nature.  This  concept  was <br/>unquestionably  the  inspiration  for  the  words  attributed  to  Jesus:  &quot;I  am  the  way,  the  truth,  and  the  life: <br/><br/><br/>no  man  cometh  unto  the  Father  but  by  me.&quot;  In  an  effort  to  make  a  single  person  out  of  Jesus  and  His <br/><br/>Christos,  Christian  writers  have  patched  together  a  doctrine  which  must  be  resolved  back  into  its <br/>original  constituents  if  the  true  meaning  of  Christianity  is  to  be  rediscovered.  In  the  Gospel  narratives <br/>the  Christos  represents  the  perfect  man  who,  having  passed  through  the  various  stages  of  the  &quot;World <br/>Mystery&quot;  symbolized  by  the  thirty-three  years,  ascends  to  the  heaven  sphere  where  he  is  reunited  with <br/>his  Eternal  Father.  The  story  of  Jesus  as  now  preserved  is&#x2014;like  the  Masonic  story  of  Hiram  Abiff&#x2014; <br/>part  of  a  secret  initiatory  ritualism  belonging  to  the  early  Christian  and  pagan  Mysteries. <br/><br/>During  the  centuries  just  prior  to  the  Christian  Era,  the  secrets  of  the  pagan  Mysteries  had  gradually <br/>fallen  into  the  hands  of  the  profane.  To  the  student  of  comparative  religion  it  is  evident  that  these <br/>secrets,  gathered  by  a  small  group  of  faithful  philosophers  and  mystics,  were  reclothed  in  new <br/>symbolical  garments  and  thus  preserved  for  several  centuries  under  the  name  of  Mystic  Christianity. <br/>It  is  generally  supposed  that  the  Essenes  were  the  custodians  of  this  knowledge  and  also  the  initiators <br/>and  educators  of  Jesus.  If  so,  Jesus  was  undoubtedly  initiated  in  the  same  temple  of  Melchizedek <br/>where  Pythagoras  had  studied  six  centuries  before. <br/><br/>The  Essenes~the  most  prominent  of  the  early  Syrian  sects&#x2014;were  an  order  of  pious  men  and  women <br/>who  lived  lives  of  asceticism,  spending  their  days  in  simple  labor  and  their  evenings  in  prayer. <br/>Josephus,  the  great  Jewish  historian,  speaks  of  them  in  the  highest  terms.  &quot;They  teach  the <br/>immortality  of  the  soul,&quot;  he  says,  &quot;and  esteem  that  the  rewards  of  righteousness  are  to  be  earnestly <br/>striven  for.&quot;  In  another  place  he  adds,  &quot;Yet  is  their  course  of  life  better  than  that  of  other  men  and <br/>they  entirely  addict  themselves  to  husbandry. &quot;  The  name  Essenes  is  supposed  to  be  derived  from  an <br/>ancient  Syrian  word  meaning  &quot;physician,&quot;  and  these  kindly  folk  are  believed  to  have  held  as  their <br/>purpose  of  existence  the  healing  of  the  sick  in  mind,  soul,  and  body.  According  to  Edouard  Schure, <br/>they  had  two  principal  communities,  or  centers,  one  in  Egypt  on  the  banks  of  Lake  Maoris,  the  other <br/>in  Palestine  at  Engaddi,  near  the  Dead  Sea.  Some  authorities  trace  the  Essenes  back  to  the  schools  of <br/>Samuel  the  Prophet,  but  most  agree  on  either  an  Egyptian  or  Oriental  origin.  Their  methods  of  prayer, <br/>meditation,  and  fasting  were  not  unlike  those  of  the  holy  men  of  the  Far  East.  Membership  in  the <br/>Essene  Order  was  possible  only  after  a  year  of  probation.  This  Mystery  school,  like  so  many  others, <br/>had  three  degrees,  and  only  a  few  candidates  passed  successfully  through  all.  The  Essenes  were <br/>divided  into  two  distinct  communities,  one  consisting  of  celibates  and  the  other  of  members  who  were <br/>married. <br/><br/>The  Essenes  never  became  merchants  or  entered  into  the  commercial  life  of  cities,  but  maintained <br/>themselves  by  agriculture  and  the  raising  of  sheep  for  wool;  also  by  such  crafts  as  pottery  and <br/>carpentry.  In  the  Gospels  and  Apocrypha,  Joseph,  the  father  of  Jesus,  is  referred  to  as  both  a <br/>carpenter  and  a  potter.  In  the  Apocryphal  Gospel  of  Thomas  and  also  that  of  Pseudo-Matthew,  the <br/>child  Jesus  is  described  as  making  sparrows  out  of  clay  which  came  to  life  and  flew  away  when  he <br/>clapped  his  hands.  The  Essenes  were  regarded  as  among  the  better  educated  class  of  Jews  and  there <br/>are  accounts  of  their  having  been  chosen  as  tutors  for  the  children  of  Roman  officers  stationed  in <br/>Syria.  The  fact  that  so  many  artificers  were  listed  among  their  number  is  responsible  for  the  order's <br/>being  considered  as  a  progenitor  of  modem  Freemasonry.  The  symbols  of  the  Essenes  include  a <br/>number  of  builders'  tools,  and  they  were  secretly  engaged <br/><br/><br/>THE  GREAT  GEORGE  AND  COLLAR  OF  THE  GARTER. <br/><br/><br/>From  Ashmole's  Order  of  the  Garter. <br/><br/>The  Order  of  the  Garter  was  probably  formed  by  Edward  III  in  imitation  of  King  Arthur's  Knights  of  the  Round  Table, <br/>which  institution  was  hopelessly  scattered  after  the  battle  of  Kamblan.  The  popular  story  to  the  effect  that  the  Countess  of <br/>Salisbury's  garter  was  the  original  inspiration  for  the  foundation  of  the  order  is  untenable.  The  motto  of  the  Order  of  the <br/>Carter  is  &quot;Honi  soit  qui  mal  y  pense&quot;  (Shamed  be  he  who  thinks  evil  of  it).  St.  George  is  looked  upon  as  the  Patron  of  the <br/>order,  for  he  typifies  the  higher  nature  of  man  overcoming  the  dragon  of  his  own  lower  nature.  While  St.  George  is <br/>supposed  to  have  lived  during  the  third  century,  it  is  probable  that  he  was  a  mythological  personage  borrowed  from  pagan <br/>mythology. <br/><br/>p.  179 <br/><br/>in  the  erection  of  a  spiritual  and  philosophical  temple  to  serve  as  a  dwelling  place  for  the  living  God. <br/><br/>Like  the  Gnostics,  the  Essenes  were  emanationists.  One  of  their  chief  objects  was  the  reinterpretation <br/>of  the  Mosaic  Law  according  to  certain  secret  spiritual  keys  preserved  by  them  from  the  time  of  the <br/>founding  of  their  order.  It  would  thus  follow  that  the  Essenes  were  Qabbalists  and,  like  several  other <br/>contemporary  sects  flourishing  in  Syria,  were  awaiting  the  advent  of  the  Messiah  promised  in  the <br/>early  Biblical  writings.  Joseph  and  Mary,  the  parents  of  Jesus,  are  believed  to  have  been  members  of <br/>the  Essene  Order.  Joseph  was  many  years  the  senior  of  Mary.  According  to  The  Protevangelium,  he <br/>was  a  widower  with  grown  sons,  and  in  the  Gospel  of  Pseudo-Matthew  he  refers  to  Mary  as  a  little <br/>child  less  in  age  than  his  own  grandchildren.  In  her  infancy  Mary  was  dedicated  to  the  Lord,  and  the <br/>Apocryphal  writings  contain  many  accounts  of  miracles  associated  with  her  early  childhood.  When <br/>she  was  twelve  years  old,  the  priests  held  counsel  as  to  the  future  of  this  child  who  had  dedicated <br/>herself  to  the  Lord,  and  the  Jewish  high  priest,  bearing  the  breastplate,  entered  into  the  Holy  of <br/>Holies,  where  an  angel  appeared  to  him,  saying,  &quot;Zacharias,  go  forth  and  summon  the  widowers  of <br/>the  people  and  let  them  take  a  rod  apiece  and  she  shall  be  the  wife  of  him  to  whom  the  Lord  shall <br/>show  a  sign.&quot;  Going  forth  to  meet  the  priests  at  the  head  of  the  widowers,  Joseph  collected  the  rods  of <br/>all  the  other  men  and  gave  them  into  the  keeping  of  the  priests.  Now  Joseph's  rod  was  but  half  as  long <br/>as  the  others,  and  the  priests  on  returning  the  rods  to  the  vddowers  paid  no  attention  to  Joseph's  but <br/>left  it  behind  in  the  Holy  of  Holies.  When  all  the  other  widowers  had  received  back  their  wands,  the <br/><br/><br/>priests  awaited  a  sign  from  heaven,  but  none  came.  Joseph,  because  of  his  advanced  age,  did  not:  ask <br/>for  the  return  of  his  rod,  for  to  him  it  was  inconceivable  that  he  should  be  chosen.  But  an  angel <br/>appeared  to  the  high  priest,  ordering  him  to  give  back  the  short  rod  which  lay  unnoticed  in  the  Holy <br/>of  Holies.  As  the  high  priest  handed  the  rod  to  Joseph,  a  white  dove  flew  from  the  end  of  it  and  rested <br/>upon  the  head  of  the  aged  carpenter,  and  to  him  was  given  the  child. <br/><br/>The  editor  of  The  Sacred  Books  and  Early  Literature  of  the  East  calls  attention  to  the  peculiar  spirit <br/>with  which  the  childhood  of  Jesus  is  treated  in  most  of  the  Apocryphal  books  of  the  New  Testament, <br/>particularly  in  one  work  attributed  to  the  doubting  Thomas,  the  earliest  known  Greek  version  of <br/>which  dates  from  about  A.D.  200:  &quot;The  child  Christ  is  represented  almost  as  an  imp,  cursing  and <br/>destroying  those  who  annoy  him.&quot;  This  Apocryphal  work,  calculated  to  inspire  its  readers  with  fear <br/>and  trembling,  was  popular  during  the  Middle  Ages  because  it  was  in  full  accord  with  the  cruel  and <br/>persecuting  spirit  of  mediaeval  Christianity.  Like  many  other  early  sacred  books,  the  book  of  Thomas <br/>was  fabricated  for  two  closely  allied  purposes:  first,  to  outshine  the  pagans  in  miracle  working; <br/>second,  to  inspire  all  unbelievers  with  the  &quot;fear  of  the  Lord.&quot;  Apocryphal  writings  of  this  sort  have  no <br/>possible  basis  in  fact.  At  one  time  an  asset,  the  &quot;miracles&quot;  of  Christianity  have  become  its  greatest <br/>liability.  Supernatural  phenomena,  in  a  credulous  age  interpolated  to  impress  the  ignorant,  in  this <br/>century  have  only  achieved  the  alienation  of  the  intelligent. <br/><br/>In  The  Greek  Gospel  ofNicodemus  it  is  declared  that  when  Jesus  was  brought  into  the  presence  of <br/>Pilate  the  standards  borne  by  the  Roman  guards  bowed  their  tops  in  homage  to  him  in  spite  of  every <br/>effort  made  by  the  soldiers  to  prevent  it.  In  The  Letters  of  Pilate  the  statement  also  appears  that <br/>Cffisar,  being  wroth  at  Pilate  for  executing  a  just  man,  ordered  him  to  be  decapitated.  Praying  for <br/>forgiveness,  Pilate  was  visited  by  an  angel  of  the  Lord,  who  reassured  the  Roman  governor  by <br/>promising  him  that  all  Christendom  should  remember  his  name  and  that  when  Christ  came  the <br/>second  time  to  judge  His  people  he  (Pilate)  should  come  before  Him  as  His  witness. <br/><br/>Stories  like  the  foregoing  represent  the  incrustations  that  have  attached  themselves  to  the  body  of <br/>Christianity  during  the  centuries.  The  popular  mind  itself  has  been  the  self-appointed  guardian  and <br/>perpetuator  of  these  legends,  bitterly  opposing  every  effort  to  divest  the  faith  of  these  questionable <br/>accumulations.  While  popular  tradition  often  contains  certain  basic  elements  of  truth,  these  elements <br/>are  usually  distorted  out  of  all  proportion.  Thus,  while  the  generalities  of  the  story  may  be <br/>fundamentally  true,  the  details  are  hopelessly  erroneous.  Of  truth  as  of  beauty  it  may  be  said  that  it  is <br/>most  adorned  when  unadorned.  Through  the  mist  of  fantastic  accounts  which  obscure  the  true <br/>foundation  of  the  Christian  faith  is  faintly  visible  to  the  discerning  few  a  great  and  noble  doctrine <br/>communicated  to  the  world  by  a  great  and  noble  soul.  Joseph  and  Mary,  two  devout  and  holy-minded <br/>souls,  consecrated  to  the  service  of  God  and  dreaming  of  the  coming  of  a  Messiah  to  serve  Israel, <br/>obeyed  the  injunctions  of  the  high  priest  of  the  Essenes  to  prepare  a  body  for  the  coming  of  a  great <br/>soul.  Thus  of  an  immaculate  conception  Jesus  was  born.  By  immaculate  is  meant  clean,  rather  than <br/>supernatural. <br/><br/>Jesus  was  reared  and  educated  by  the  Essenes  and  later  initiated  into  the  most  profound  of  their <br/>Mysteries.  Like  all  great  initiates.  He  must  travel  in  an  easterly  direction,  and  the  silent  years  of  His <br/>life  no  doubt  were  spent  in  familiarizing  Himself  with  that  secret  teaching  later  to  be  communicated <br/>by  Him  to  the  world.  Having  consummated  the  ascetic  practices  of  His  order.  He  attained  to  the <br/>Christening.  Having  thus  reunited  Himself  with  His  own  spiritual  source.  He  then  went  forth  in  the <br/>name  of  the  One  who  has  been  crucified  since  before  the  worlds  were  and,  gathering  about  Him <br/>disciples  and  apostles,  He  instructed  them  in  that  secret  teaching  which  had  been  lost&#x2014;in  part,  at <br/>least &#x2014;from  the  doctrines  of  Israel.  His  fate  is  unknown,  but  in  all  probability  He  suffered  that <br/>persecution  which  is  the  lot  of  those  who  seek  to  reconstruct  the  ethical,  philosophical,  or  religious <br/>systems  of  their  day. <br/><br/><br/>To  the  multitudes  Jesus  spoke  in  parables;  to  His  disciples  He  also  spoke  in  parables,  though  of  a <br/>more  exalted  and  philosophic  nature.  Voltaire  said  that  Plato  should  have  been  canonized  by  the <br/>Christian  Church,  for,  being  the  first  propounder  of  the  Christos  mystery,  he  contributed  more  to  its <br/>fundamental  doctrines  than  any  other  single  individual.  Jesus  disclosed  to  His  disciples  that  the  lower <br/>world  is  under  the  control  of  a  great  spiritual  being  which  had  fashioned  it  according  to  the  will  of  the <br/>Eternal  Father.  The  mind  of  this  great  angel  was  both  the  mind  of  the  world  and  also  the  worldly <br/>mind.  So  that  men  should  not  die  of  worldliness  the  Eternal  Father  sent  unto  creation  the  eldest  and <br/>most  exalted  of  His  powers&#x2014;the  Divine  Mind.  This  Divine  Mind  offered  Itself  as  a  living  sacrifice  and <br/>was  broken  up  and  eaten  by  the  world.  Having  given  Its  spirit  and  Its  body  at  a  secret  and  sacred <br/>supper  to  the  twelve  manners  of  rational  creatures,  this  Divine  Mind  became  a  part  of  every  living <br/>thing.  Man  was  thereby  enabled  to  use  this  power  as  a  bridge  across  which  he  might  pass  and  attain <br/>immortality.  He  who  lifted  up  his  soul  to  this  Divine  Mind  and  served  It  was  righteous  and,  having <br/>attained  righteousness,  liberated  this  Divine  Mind,  which  thereupon  returned  again  in  glory  to  Its <br/>own  divine  source.  And  because  He  had  brought  to  them  this  knowledge,  the  disciples  said  one  to <br/>another:  &quot;Lo,  He  is  Himself  this  Mind  personified!&quot; <br/><br/>THE  ARTHURIAN  CYCLE  AND  LEGEND  OF  THE  HOLY  GRAIL <br/><br/>According  to  legend,  the  body  of  the  Christos  (the  Spiritual  Law)  was  given  into  the  keeping  of  two <br/>men,  of  whom  the  Gospels  make <br/><br/><br/>JAKOB  BOHME,  THE  TEUTONIC  THEOSOPHER. <br/><br/><br/>From  William  Law's  Translation  of  The  Works  of  Jakob  Bohme. <br/><br/><br/>Jakob  Bohme  was  born  in  the  year  1575  in  a  village  near  Gorlitz,  and  died  in  Silesia  in  1624.  He  had  but  little  schooling <br/>and  was  apprenticed  at  an  early  age  to  a  shoemaker.  He  later  became  a  journeyman  shoemaker,  married  and  had  four <br/>children  One  day  while  tending  his  master's  shoe  shop,  a  mysterious  stranger  entered  who  while  he  seemed  to  possess  but <br/>little  of  this  world's  goods,  appeared  to  be  most  wise  and  noble  in  spiritual  attainment.  The  stranger  asked  the  price  of  a <br/>pair  of  shoes,  but  young  Bohme  did  not  dare  to  name  a  figure,  for  fear  that  he  would  displease  his  master.  The  stranger <br/><br/><br/>insisted  and  Bohme  finally  placed  a  valuation  which  he  was  all  that  his  master  possibly  could  hope  to  secure  for  the  shoes. <br/>The  stranger  immediately  bought  them  and  departed.  A  short  distance  down  the  street  the  mysterious  stranger  stopped <br/>and  cried  out  in  a  loud  voice,  &quot;Jakob,  Jakob  come  forth.&quot;  In  amazement  and  fright,  Bohme  ran  out  of  the  house.  The <br/>strange  man  fixed  his  yes  upon  the  youth&#x2014;great  eyes  which  sparkled  and  seemed  filled  with  divine  light.  He  took  the  boy's <br/>right  hand  and  addressed  him  as  follows~&quot;Jakob,  thou  art  little,  but  shalt  be  great,  and  become  another  Man,  such  a  one <br/>as  at  whom  the  World  shall  wonder.  Therefore  be  pious,  fear  God,  and  reverence  His  Word.  Read  diligently  the  Holy <br/>Scriptures,  wherein  you  have  Comfort  and  Instruction.  For  thou  ust  endure  much  Misery  and  Poverty,  and  suffer <br/>Persecution,  but  be  courageous  and  persevere,  far  God  loves,  and  is  gracious  to  thee.&quot;  Deeply  impressed  by  the  prediction, <br/>Bohme  became  ever  more  intense  in  his  search  for  truth.  At  last  his  labors  were  reworded.  For  seven  days  he  remained  in <br/>a  mysterious  condition  during  which  time  the  mysteries  of  the  invisible  world  were  revealed  to  him.  It  has  been  said  of <br/>Jakob  Bohme  that  he  revealed  to  all  mankind  the  deepest  secrets  of  alchemy.  He  died  surrounded  by  his  family,  his  last <br/>words  being  &quot;Now  I  go  hence  into  Paradise.&quot; <br/><br/>p.  180 <br/><br/>but  brief  mention.  These  were  Nicodemus  and  Joseph  of  Arimathea,  both  devout  men  who,  though <br/>not  Hsted  among  the  disciples  or  apostles  of  the  Christos,  were  of  all  men  chosen  to  be  custodians  of <br/>His  sacred  remains.  Joseph  of  Arimathea  was  one  of  the  initiated  brethren  and  is  called  by  A.  E. <br/>Waite,  in  his  A  New  Encyclopaedia  of  Freemasonry,  &quot;the  first  bishop  of  Christendom.&quot;  just  as  the <br/>temporal  (or  visible)  power  of  the  Holy  See  was  established  by  St.  Peter(?),  so  the  spiritual  (or <br/>invisible)  body  of  the  faith  was  entrusted  to  the  &quot;Secret  Church  of  the  Holy  Grail&quot;  through  apostolic <br/>succession  from  Joseph  of  Arimathea,  into  whose  keeping  had  been  given  the  perpetual  symbols  of <br/>the  covenant &#x2014;the  ever-flowing  cup  and  the  bleeding  spear. <br/><br/>Presumably  obeying  instructions  of  St.  Philip,  Joseph  of  Arimathea,  carrying  the  sacred  relics, <br/>reached  Britain  after  passing  through  many  and  varied  hardships.  Here  a  site  was  allotted  to  him  for <br/>the  erection  of  a  church,  and  in  this  manner  Glastonbury  Abbey  was  founded.  Joseph  planted  his  staff <br/>in  the  earth  and  it  took  root,  becoming  a  miraculous  thorn  bush  which  blossomed  twice  a  year  and <br/>which  is  now  called  the  Glastonbury  thorn.  The  end  of  the  life  of  Joseph  of  Arimathea  is  unknown.  By <br/>some  it  is  believed  that,  like  Enoch,  he  was  translated;  by  others,  that  he  was  buried  in  Glastonbury <br/>Abbey.  Repeated  attempts  have  been  made  to  find  the  Holy  Grail,  which  many  believe  to  have  been <br/>hidden  in  a  crypt  beneath  the  ancient  abbey.  The  Glastonbury  chalice  recently  discovered  and  by  the <br/>devout  supposed  to  be  the  original  Sangreal  can  scarcely  be  accepted  as  genuine  by  the  critical <br/>investigator.  Beyond  its  inherent  interest  as  a  relic,  like  the  famous  Antioch  chalice  it  actually  proves <br/>nothing  when  it  is  realized  that  practically  little  more  was  known  about  the  Christian  Mysteries <br/>eighteen  centuries  ago  than  can  be  discovered  today. <br/><br/>The  origin  of  the  Grail  myth,  as  of  nearly  every  other  element  in  the  great  drama,  is  curiously  elusive. <br/>Sufficient  foundation  for  it  may  be  found  in  the  folklore  of  the  British  Isles,  which  contains  many <br/>accounts  of  magic  cauldrons,  kettles,  cups,  and  drinking  horns.  The  earliest  Grail  legends  describe  the <br/>cup  as  a  veritable  horn  of  plenty.  Its  contents  were  inexhaustible  and  those  who  served  it  never <br/>hungered  or  thirsted.  One  account  states  that  no  matter  how  desperately  ill  a  person  might  be  he <br/>could  not  die  within  eight  days  of  beholding  the  cup.  Some  authorities  believe  the  Holy  Grail  to  be  the <br/>perpetuation  of  the  holy  cup  used  in  the  rites  of  Adonis  and  Atys.  A  communion  cup  or  chalice  was <br/>used  in  several  of  the  ancient  Mysteries,  and  the  god  Bacchus  is  frequently  symbolized  in  the  form  of <br/>a  vase,  cup,  or  urn.  In  Nature  worship  the  ever-flowing  Grail  signifies  the  bounty  of  the  harvest  by <br/>which  the  life  of  man  is  sustained;  like  Mercury's  bottomless  pitcher,  it  is  the  inexhaustible  fountain <br/>of  natural  re  source.  From  the  evidence  at  hand  it  would  indeed  be  erroneous  to  ascribe  a  purely <br/>Christian  origin  to  the  Grail  symbolism. <br/><br/>In  the  Arthurian  Cycle  appears  a  strange  and  mysterious  figure&#x2014;Merlin,  the  magician.  In  one  of  the <br/>legends  concerning  him  it  is  declared  that  when  Jesus  was  sent  to  liberate  the  world  from  the <br/>bondage  of  evil,  the  Adversary  determined  to  send  an  Antichrist  to  undo  His  labors.  The  Devil <br/>therefore  in  the  form  of  a  horrible  dragon  overshadowed  a  young  woman  who  had  taken  refuge  in <br/>sanctuary  to  escape  the  evil  which  had  destroyed  her  family.  When  Merlin,  her  child,  was  born  he <br/><br/><br/>partook  of  the  characteristics  of  his  human  mother  and  demon  father.  MerUn,  however,  did  not  serve <br/>the  powers  of  darkness  but,  being  converted  to  the  true  hght,  retained  only  two  of  the  supernatural <br/>powers  inherited  from  his  father:  prophecy  and  miracle  working.  The  story  of  Merlin's  infernal  father <br/>must  really  be  considered  as  an  allegorical  allusion  to  the  fact  that  he  was  a  &quot;philosophical  son&quot;  of  the <br/>serpent  or  dragon,  a  title  applied  to  all  initiates  of  the  Mysteries,  who  thus  acknowledge  Nature  as <br/>their  mortal  mother  and  wisdom  in  the  form  of  the  serpent  or  dragon  as  their  immortal  Father. <br/>Confusion  of  the  dragon  and  serpent  with  the  powers  of  evil  has  resulted  as  an  inevitable  consequence <br/>from  misinterpretation  of  the  early  chapters  of  Genesis. <br/><br/>Arthur  while  an  infant  was  given  into  the  keeping  of  Merlin,  the  Mage,  and  in  his  youth  instructed  by <br/>him  in  the  secret  doctrine  and  probably  initiated  into  the  deepest  secrets  of  natural  magic.  With <br/>Merlin's  assistance,  Arthur  became  the  leading  general  of  Britain,  a  degree  of  dignity  which  has  been <br/>confused  with  kingship.  After  Arthur  had  drawn  the  sword  of  Branstock  from  the  anvil  and  thus <br/>established  his  divine  right  to  leadership,  Merlin  further  assisted  him  to  secure  from  the  Lady  of  the <br/>Lake  the  sacred  sword  Excalibur.  After  the  establishment  of  the  Round  Table,  having  fulfilled  his  duty, <br/>Merlin  disappeared,  according  to  one  account  vanishing  into  the  air,  where  he  still  exists  as  a  shadow <br/>communicating  at  will  with  mortals;  according  to  another,  retiring  of  his  own  accord  into  a  great <br/>stone  vault  which  he  sealed  from  within. <br/><br/>It  is  reasonably  certain  that  many  legends  regarding  Charlemagne  were  later  associated  with  Arthur, <br/>who  is  most  famous  for  establishing  the  Order  of  the  Round  Table  at  Winchester.  Reliable <br/>information  is  not  to  be  had  concerning  the  ceremonies  and  initiatory  rituals  of  the  &quot;Table  Round.&quot;  In <br/>one  story  the  Table  was  endowed  with  the  powers  of  expansion  and  contraction  so  that  fifteen  or <br/>fifteen  hundred  could  be  seated  around  it,  according  to  whatever  need  might  arise.  The  most  common <br/>accounts  fix  the  number  of  knights  who  could  be  seated  at  one  time  at  the  Round  Table  at  either <br/>twelve  or  twenty-four.  The  twelve  signified  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  and  also  the  apostles  of  Jesus.  The <br/>knights'  names  and  also  their  heraldic  arms  were  emblazoned  upon  their  chairs.  When  twenty-four <br/>are  shown  seated  at  the  Table,  each  of  the  twelve  signs  of  the  zodiac  is  divided  into  two  parts&#x2014;a  light <br/>and  a  dark  half &#x2014;to  signify  the  nocturnal  and  diurnal  phases  of  each  sign.  As  each  sign  of  the  zodiac  is <br/>ascending  for  two  hours  every  day,  so  the  twenty-four  knights  represent  the  hours,  the  twenty-four <br/>elders  before  the  throne  in  Revelation,  and  twenty-four  Persian  deities  who  represent  the  spirits  of <br/>the  divisions  of  the  day.  In  the  center  of  the  Table  was  the  symbolic  rose  of  the  Passion  of  Our  Lord <br/>Jesus  Christ,  the  symbol  of  resurrection  in  that  He  &quot;rose&quot;  from  the  dead.  There  was  also  a  mysterious <br/>empty  seat  called  the  Siege  Perilous  in  which  none  might  sit  except  he  who  was  successful  in  his  quest <br/>for  the  Holy  Grad. <br/><br/>In  the  personality  of  Arthur  is  to  be  found  a  new  form  of  the  ever-recurrent  cosmic  myth.  The  prince <br/>of  Britain  is  the  sun,  his  knights  are  the  zodiac,  and  his  flashing  sword  may  be  the  sun's  ray  with <br/>which  he  fights  and  vanquishes  the  dragons  of  darkness  or  it  may  represent  the  earth's  axis.  Arthur's <br/>Round  Table  is  the  universe;  the  Siege  Perilous  the  throne  of  the  perfect  man.  In  its  terrestrial  sense, <br/>Arthur  was  the  Grand  Master  of  a  secret  Christian-Masonic  brotherhood  of  philosophic  mystics  who <br/>termed  themselves  Knights.  Arthur  received  the  exalted  position  of  Grand  Master  of  these  Knights <br/>because  he  had  faithfully  accomplished  the  withdrawal  of  the  sword  (spirit)  from  the  anvil  of  the  base <br/>metals  (his  lower  nature).  As  invariably  happens,  the  historical  Arthur  soon  was  confused  with  the <br/>allegories  and  myths  of  his  order  until  now  the  two  are  inseparable.  After  Arthur's  death  on  the  field <br/>of  Kamblan  his  Mysteries  ceased,  and  esoterically  he  was  borne  away  on  a  black  barge,  as  is  so <br/>beautifully  described  by  Tennyson  in  his  Morte  d'Arthur.  The  great  sword  Excalibur  was  also  cast <br/>back  into  the  waters  of  eternity&#x2014;all  of  which  is  a  vivid  portrayal  of  the  descent  of  cosmic  night  at  the <br/>end  of  the  Day  of  Universal  Manifestation.  The  body  of  the  historical  Arthur  was  probably  interred  at <br/>Glastonbury  Abbey,  a  building  closely  identified  with  the  mystic  rites  of  both  the  Grail  and  the <br/>Arthurian  Cycle. <br/><br/><br/>The  mediaeval  Rosicrucians  were  undoubtedly  in  possession  of  the  true  secret  of  the  Arthurian  Cycle <br/>and  the  Grail  legend,  much  of  their  symbolism  having  been  incorporated  into  that  order.  Though  the <br/>most  obvious  of  all  keys  to  the  Christos  mystery,  the  Grail  legend  has  received  the  least  consideration. <br/><br/><br/>THE  NIMBUS  AND  AUREOLE  IN  SYMBOLISM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Audsley's  Handbook  of  Christian  Symbolism. <br/><br/>The  golden  halos  around  the  heads  of  pagan  gods  and  Christian  saints  refer  both  to  their  being  bathed  in  the  glory  of  the <br/>sun  and  also  to  the  fact  that  a  spiritual  sun  within  their  own  natures  is  radiating  its  glow-ray  and  surrounding  them  with <br/>celestial  splendor.  Whenever  the  nimbus  is  composed  of  straight  radiant  lines,  it  is  solar  in  significance;  whenever  curved <br/>lines  are  used  for  beams,  it  partakes  lunar  nature;  whenever  they  are  united,  it  symbolizes  a,  harmonious  blending  of  both <br/>principles.  The  circular  nimbus  is  solar  and  masculine,  while  the  lozenge-shaped  nimbus,  or  vesica  piscis,  is  lunar  and <br/>feminine.  The  same  symbolism  is  preserved  in  the  circular  and  lozenge-shaped  windows  of  cathedrals.  There  is  a  complete <br/>science  contained  in  the  shape,  color,  and  adornments  of  the  halos  of  saints  and  martyrs.  A  plain  golden  ring  usually <br/>surrounds  the  head  of  a  canonized  saint,  while  God  the  Father  and  God  the  Son  have  a  far  more  ornate  aureole,  usually <br/>adorned  with  a  St.  George  Cross,  a  flowered  cross,  or  a  lilied  cross,  with  only  three  of  the  arms  visible. <br/><br/><br/>p.  181 <br/><br/><br/>The  Cross  and  the  Crucifixion <br/><br/>ONE  of  the  most  interesting  legends  concerning  the  cross  is  that  preserved  in  Aurea  Legenda,  by <br/>Jacobus  de  Vorgaine.  The  Story  is  to  the  effect  that  Adam,  feehng  the  end  of  his  hfe  was  near, <br/>entreated  his  son  Seth  to  make  a  pilgrimage  to  the  Garden  of  Eden  and  secure  from  the  angel  on <br/>guard  at  the  entrance  the  Oil  of  Mercy  which  God  had  promised  mankind.  Seth  did  not  know  the  way; <br/>but  his  father  told  him  it  was  in  an  eastward  direction,  and  the  path  would  be  easy  to  follow,  for  when <br/>Adam  and  Eve  were  banished  from  the  Garden  of  the  Lord,  upon  the  path  which  their  feet  had  trod <br/>the  grass  had  never  grown. <br/><br/>Seth,  following  the  directions  of  his  father,  discovered  the  Garden  of  Eden  without  difficulty.  The <br/>angel  who  guarded  the  gate  permitted  him  to  enter,  and  in  the  midst  of  the  garden  Seth  beheld  a  great <br/>tree,  the  branches  of  which  reached  up  to  heaven.  The  tree  was  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  and  stood  on <br/>the  brink  of  a  precipice  which  led  downward  into  the  depths  of  hell.  Among  the  roots  of  the  tree  he <br/>saw  the  body  of  his  brother  Cain,  held  prisoner  by  the  entwining  limbs.  The  angel  refused  to  give  Seth <br/>the  Oil  of  Mercy,  but  presented  him  instead  with  three  seeds  from  the  Tree  of  Life  (some  say  the  Tree <br/>of  Knowledge).  With  these  Seth  returned  to  his  father,  who  was  so  overjoyed  that  he  did  not  desire  to <br/>live  longer.  Three  days  later  he  died,  and  the  three  seeds  were  buried  in  his  mouth,  as  the  angel  had <br/>instructed.  The  seeds  became  a  sapling  with  three  trunks  in  one,  which  absorbed  into  itself  the  blood <br/>of  Adam,  so  that  the  life  of  Adam  was  in  the  tree.  Noah  dug  up  this  tree  by  the  roots  and  took  it  with <br/>him  into  the  Ark.  After  the  waters  subsided,  he  buried  the  skull  of  Adam  under  Mount  Calvary,  and <br/>planted  the  tree  on  the  summit  of  Mount  Lebanon. <br/><br/>Moses  beheld  a  visionary  being  in  the  midst  of  this  tree  (the  burning  bush)  and  from  it  cut  the <br/>magical  rod  with  which  he  was  able  to  bring  water  out  of  a  stone.  But  because  he  failed  to  call  upon <br/>the  Lord  the  second  time  he  struck  the  rock,  he  was  not  permitted  to  carry  the  sacred  staff  into  the <br/>Promised  Land;  so  he  planted  it  in  the  hills  of  Moab.  After  much  searching.  King  David  discovered <br/>the  tree;  and  his  son,  Solomon,  tried  to  use  it  for  a  pillar  in  his  Temple,  but  his  carpenters  could  not <br/>cut  it  so  that  it  would  fit;  it  was  always  either  too  long  or  too  short.  At  last,  disgusted,  they  cast  it  aside <br/>and  used  it  for  a  bridge  to  connect  Jerusalem  with  the  surrounding  hills.  When  the  Queen  of  Sheba <br/>came  to  visit  King  Solomon  she  was  expected  to  walk  across  this  bridge.  Instead,  when  she  beheld  the <br/>tree,  she  refused  to  put  her  foot  upon  it,  but,  after  kneeling  and  praying,  removed  her  sandals  and <br/>forded  the  stream.  This  so  impressed  King  Solomon  that  he  ordered  the  log  to  be  overlaid  with  golden <br/>places  and  placed  above  the  door  of  his  Temple.  There  it  remained  until  his  covetous  grandson  stole <br/>the  gold,  and  buried  the  tree  so  that  the  crime  would  not  be  discovered. <br/><br/>From  the  ground  where  the  tree  was  buried  there  immediately  bubbled  forth  a  spring  of  water,  which <br/>became  known  as  Bethesda.  To  it  the  sick  from  all  Syria  came  to  be  healed.  The  angel  of  the  pool <br/>became  the  guardian  of  the  tree,  and  it  remained  undisturbed  for  many  years.  Eventually  the  log <br/>floated  to  the  surface  and  was  used  as  a  bridge  again,  this  time  between  Calvary  and  Jerusalem;  and <br/>over  it  Jesus  passed  to  be  crucified.  There  was  no  wood  on  Calvary;  so  the  tree  was  cut  into  two  parts <br/>to  serve  as  the  cross  upon  which  the  Son  of  Man  was  crucified.  The  cross  was  set  up  at  the  very  spot <br/>where  the  skull  of  Adam  had  been  buried.  Later,  when  the  cross  was  discovered  by  the  Empress <br/>Helena,  the  wood  was  found  to  be  of  four  different  varieties  contained  in  one  tree  (representing  the <br/>elements),  and  thereafter  the  cross  continued  to  heal  all  the  sick  who  were  permitted  to  touch  it. <br/><br/>The  prevalent  idea  that  the  reverence  for  the  cross  is  limited  to  the  Christian  world  is  disproved  by <br/>even  the  most  superficial  investigation  of  its  place  in  religious  symbolism.  The  early  Christians  used <br/>every  means  possible  to  conceal  the  pagan  origin  of  their  symbols,  doctrines,  and  rituals.  They  either <br/>destroyed  the  sacred  books  of  other  peoples  among  whom  they  settled,  or  made  them  inaccessible  to <br/><br/><br/>students  of  comparative  philosophy,  apparently  believing  that  in  this  way  they  could  stamp  out  all <br/><br/>record  of  the  pre-Christian  origin  of  their  doctrines.  In  some  cases  the  writings  of  various  ancient <br/>authors  were  tampered  with,  passages  of  a  compromising  nature  being  removed  or  foreign  material <br/>interpolated.  The  supposedly  spurious  passage  in  Josephus  concerning  Jesus  is  an  example  adduced <br/>to  illustrate  this  proclivity. <br/><br/>THE  LOST  LIBRARIES  OF  ALEXANDRIA <br/><br/>Prior  to  the  Christian  Era  seven  hundred  thousand  of  the  most  valuable  books,  written  upon <br/>parchment,  papyrus,  vellum,  and  wax,  and  also  tablets  of  stone,  terra  cotta,  and  wood,  were  gathered <br/>from  all  parts  of  the  ancient  world  and  housed  in  Alexandria,  in  buildings  specially  prepared  for  the <br/>purpose.  This  magnificent  repository  of  knowledge  was  destroyed  by  a  series  of  three  fires.  The  parts <br/>that  escaped  the  conflagration  lighted  by  Caesar  to  destroy  the  fleet  in  the  harbor  were  destroyed <br/>about  A.D.  389  by  the  Christians  in  obedience  to  the  edict  of  Theodosius,  who  had  ordered  the <br/>destruction  of  the  Serapeum,  a  building  sacred  to  Serapis  in  which  the  volumes  were  kept.  This <br/>conflagration  is  supposed  to  have  destroyed  the  library  that  Marcus  Antonius  had  presented  to <br/>Cleopatra  to  compensate  in  part  for  that  burned  in  the  fire  of  the  year  51. <br/><br/>Concerning  this,  H.  P.  Blavatsky,  in  Isis  Unveiled,  has  written:  &quot;They  [the  Rabbis  of  Palestine  and  the <br/>wise  men]  say  that  not  all  the  rolls  and  manuscripts,  reported  in  history  to  have  been  burned  by <br/>Ceesar,  by  the  Christian  mob,  in  389,  and  by  the  Arab  General  Amru,  perished  as  it  is  commonly <br/>believed;  and  the  story  they  tell  is  the  following:  At  the  time  of  the  contest  for  the  throne,  in  51  B.  C, <br/>between  Cleopatra  and  her  brother  Dionysius  Ptolemy,  the  Bruckion,  which  contained  over  seven <br/>hundred  thousand  rolls  all  bound  in  wood  and  fire-proof  parchment,  was  undergoing  repairs  and  a <br/>great  portion  of  the  original  manuscripts,  considered  among  the  most  precious,  and  which  were  not <br/>duplicated,  were  stored  away  in  the  house  of  one  of  the  librarians.  *  *  *Several  hours  passed  between <br/>the  burning  of  the  fleet,  set  on  fire  by  Csesar's  order,  and  the  moment  when  the  first  buildings  situated <br/>near  the  harbor  caught  fire  in  their  turn;  and  *  *  *  the  librarians,  aided  by  several  hundred  slaves <br/>attached  to  the  museum,  succeeded  in  saving  the  most  precious  of  the  rolls.&quot;  In  all  probability,  the <br/>books  which  were  saved  lie  buried  either  in  Egypt  or  in  India,  and  until  they  are  discovered  the <br/>modem  world  must  remain  in  ignorance  concerning  many  great  philosophical  and  mystical  truths. <br/>The  ancient  world  more  clearly  understood  these  missing  links&#x2014;the  continuity  of  the  pagan  Mysteries <br/>in  Christianity. <br/><br/>THE  CROSS  IN  PAGAN  SYMBOLISM <br/><br/>In  his  article  on  the  Cross  and  Crucifixion  in  the  Encyclopgedia  Britannica,  Thomas  Macall  Fallow <br/>casts  much  light  on  the  antiquity  of  this  ideograph.  &quot;The  use  of  the  cross  as  a  religious  symbol  in  pre- <br/>Christian  times,  and  among  non-Christian  peoples,  may <br/><br/><br/>HISTORY  OF  THE  HOLY  CROSS. <br/><br/><br/>From  Berjeau's  History  of  the  Holy  Cross. <br/><br/>(i)  Adam  directing  Seth  how  to  reach  the  Garden  of  Eden.  (2)  Seth  placing  the  three  seeds  from  the  Tree  of  Life  under  the <br/>tongue  of  the  dead  Adam.  (3)  The  Queen  of  Sheba,  refusing  to  place  her  feet  upon  the  sacred  tree,  forded  the  stream.  (4) <br/>Placing  the  sacred  tree  over  the  door  of  Solomon's  Temple.  (5)  The  crucifixion  of  Christ  upon  a  cross  made  from  the  wood <br/>of  the  holy  tree.  (6)  Distinguishing  the  true  cross  from  the  other  two  by  testing  its  power  to  raise  a  corpse  to  life. <br/><br/>p.  182 <br/><br/>probably  be  regarded  as  almost  universal,  and  in  very  many  cases  it  was  connected  with  some  form  of <br/>nature  worship.&quot; <br/><br/>Not  only  is  the  cross  itself  a  familiar  object  in  the  art  of  all  nations,  but  the  veneration  for  it  is  an <br/>essential  part  of  the  religious  life  of  the  greater  part  of  humanity.  It  is  a  common  symbol  among  the <br/>American  Indians&#x2014;North,  Central,  and  South.  William  W.  Seymour  states:  &quot;The  Aztec  goddess  of  rain <br/>bore  a  cross  in  her  hand,  and  the  Toltecs  claimed  that  their  deity,  Quetzalcoatl,  taught  them  the  sign <br/>and  ritual  of  the  cross,  hence  his  staff,  or  sceptre  of  power,  resembled  a  crosier,  and  his  mantle  was <br/>covered  with  red  crosses.&quot;  (The  Cross  in  Tradition,  History  and  Art.) <br/><br/>The  cross  is  also  highly  revered  by  the  Japanese  and  Chinese.  To  the  Pythagoreans  the  most  sacred  of <br/>all  numbers  was  the  10,  the  symbol  of  which  is  an  X,  or  cross.  In  both  the  Japanese  and  Chinese <br/>languages  the  character  of  the  number  10  is  a  cross.  The  Buddhist  wheel  of  life  is  composed  of  two <br/>crosses  superimposed,  and  its  eight  points  are  still  preserved  to  Christendom  in  the  peculiarly  formed <br/>cross  of  the  Knights  Templars,  which  is  essentially  Buddhistic.  India  has  preserved  the  cross,  not  only <br/>in  its  carvings  and  paintings,  but  also  in  its  architectonics;  a  great  number  of  its  temples&#x2014;like  the <br/>churches  and  cathedrals  of  Christendom&#x2014; are  raised  from  cruciform  foundations. <br/><br/>On  the  mandalas  of  the  Tibetans,  heaven  is  laid  out  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  with  a  demon  king  at  each <br/>of  the  four  gates.  A  remarkable  cross  of  great  antiquity  was  discovered  in  the  island  caves  of <br/>Elephanta  in  the  harbor  of  Bombay.  Crosses  of  various  kinds  were  favorite  motifs  in  the  art  of <br/><br/><br/>Chaldea,  Phoenicia,  Egypt,  and  Assyria.  The  initiates  of  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  of  Greece  were  given <br/>a  cross  which  they  suspended  about  their  necks  on  a  chain,  or  cord,  at  the  time  of  initiation.  To  the <br/>Rosicrucians,  Alchemists,  and  lUuminati,  the  cross  was  the  symbol  of  light,  because  each  of  the  three <br/>letters  L  V  X  is  derived  from  some  part  of  the  cross. <br/><br/>THE  TAU  CROSS <br/><br/>There  are  three  distinct  forms  of  the  cross.  The  first  is  called  the  TAU  (more  correctly  the  TAV).  It <br/>closely  resembles  the  modern  letter  T,  consisting  of  a  horizontal  bar  resting  on  a  vertical  column,  the <br/>two  arms  being  of  equal  length.  An  oak  tree  cut  off  some  feet  above  the  ground  and  its  upper  part  laid <br/>across  the  lower  in  this  form  was  the  symbol  of  the  Druid  god  Hu.  It  is  suspected  that  this  symbol <br/>originated  among  the  Egyptians  from  the  spread  of  the  horns  of  a  bull  or  ram  (Taurus  or  Aries)  and <br/>the  vertical  line  of  its  face.  This  is  sometimes  designated  as  the  hammer  cross,  because  if  held  by  its <br/>vertical  base  it  is  not  unlike  a  mallet  or  gavel.  In  one  of  the  Qabbalistic  Masonic  legends,  CHiram <br/>Abiff  is  given  a  hammer  in  the  form  of  a  TAU  by  his  ancestor,  Tubal-cain.  The  TAU  cross  is  preserved <br/>to  modern  Masonry  under  the  symbol  of  the  T  square.  This  appears  to  be  the  oldest  form  of  the  cross <br/>extant. <br/><br/>The  TAU  cross  was  inscribed  on  the  forehead  of  every  person  admitted  into  the  Mysteries  of  Mithras. <br/>When  a  king  was  initiated  into  the  Egyptian  Mysteries,  the  TAU  was  placed  against  his  lips.  It  was <br/>tattooed  upon  the  bodies  of  the  candidates  in  some  of  the  American  Indian  Mysteries.  To  the <br/>Qabbalist,  the  TAU  stood  for  heaven  and  the  Pythagorean  tetractys.  The  Caduceus  of  Hermes  was  an <br/>outgrowth  of  the  TAU  cross.  (See  Albert  Pike.) <br/><br/>THE  CRUX  ANSATA <br/><br/>The  second  type  was  that  of  a  T,  or  TAU,  cross  surmounted  by  a  circle,  often  foreshortened  to  the <br/>form  of  an  upright  oval.  This  was  called  by  the  ancients  the  Crux  Ansata,  or  the  cross  of  life  .  It  was <br/>the  key  to  the  Mysteries  of  antiquity  and  it  probably  gave  rise  to  the  more  modern  story  of  St.  Peter's <br/>golden  key  to  heaven.  In  the  Mysteries  of  Egypt  the  candidate  passed  through  all  forms  of  actual  and <br/>imaginary  dangers,  holding  above  his  head  the  Crux  Ansata,  before  which  the  powers  of  darkness  fell <br/>back  abashed.  The  student  is  reminded  of  the  words  In  hoc  signo  vinces.  The  TAU  form  of  the  cross  is <br/>not  unlike  the  seal  of  Venus,  as  Richard  Payne  Knight  has  noted.  He  states:  &quot;The  cross  in  this  form  is <br/>sometimes  observable  on  coins,  and  several  of  them  were  found  in  a  temple  of  Serapis  [the <br/>Serapeum],  demolished  at  the  general  destruction  of  those  edifices  by  the  Emperor  Theodosius,  and <br/>were  said  by  the  Christian  antiquaries  of  that  time  to  signify  the  future  life.&quot; <br/><br/>Augustus  Le  Plongeon,  in  his  Sacred  Mysteries  Among  the  Mayas  and  Quiches,  notes  that  the  Crux <br/>Ansata,  which  he  calls  The  Key  to  the  Nile  and  the  Symbol  of  Symbols,  either  in  its  complete  form  or <br/>as  a  simple  TAU,  was  to  be  seen  adorning  the  breasts  of  statues  and  bas-reliefs  at  Palenque,  Copan, <br/>and  throughout  Central  America.  He  notes  that  it  was  always  associated  with  water;  that  among  the <br/>Babylonians  it  was  the  emblem  of  the  water  gods;  among  the  Scandinavians,  of  heaven  and <br/>immortality;  and  among  the  Mayas,  of  rejuvenation  and  freedom  from  physical  suffering. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  association  of  this  symbol  with  the  waters  of  life,  Count  Goblet  d'Alviella,  in  his <br/>Migration  of  Symbols,  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  an  instrument  resembling  the  Crux  Ansata  and <br/>called  the  Milometer  was  used  by  the  ancient  Egyptians  for  measuring  and  regulating  the  inundations <br/>of  the  river  Nile.  It  is  probable  that  this  relationship  to  the  Nile  caused  it  to  be  considered  the  symbol <br/>of  life,  for  Egypt  depended  entirely  upon  the  inundations  of  this  river  for  the  irrigation  necessary  to <br/>insure  sufficient  crops.  In  the  papyrus  scrolls  the  Crux  Ansata  is  shown  issuing  from  the  mouths  of <br/>Egyptian  kings  when  they  pardoned  enemies,  and  it  was  buried  with  them  to  signify  the  immortality <br/>of  the  soul.  It  was  carried  by  many  of  the  gods  and  goddesses  and  apparently  signified  their  divine <br/><br/><br/>benevolence  and  life-giving  power.  The  Cairo  Museum  contains  a  magnificent  collection  of  crosses  of <br/>many  shapes,  sizes,  and  designs,  proving  that  they  were  a  common  symbol  among  the  Egyptians. <br/><br/>THE  ROMAN  AND  GREEK  CATHOLIC  CROSSES <br/><br/>The  third  form  of  the  cross  is  the  familiar  Roman  or  Greek  type,  which  is  closely  associated  with  the <br/>crucifixion  of  Jesus  Christ,  although  it  is  improbable  that  the  cross  used  resembled  its  more  familiar <br/>modern  form.  There  are  unlimited  sub-varieties  of  crosses,  differing  in  the  relative  proportions  of <br/>their  vertical  and  horizontal  sections.  Among  the  secret  orders  of  different  generations  we  find <br/>compounded  crosses,  such  as  the  triple  TAU  in  the  Royal  Arch  of  Freemasonry  and  the  double  and <br/>triple  crosses  of  both  Masonic  and  Roman  Catholic  symbolism. <br/><br/>To  the  Christian  the  cross  has  a  twofold  significance.  First,  it  is  the  symbol  of  the  death  of  his <br/>Redeemer,  through  whose  martyrdom  he  feels  that  he  partakes  of  the  glory  of  God;  secondly,  it  is  the <br/>symbol  of  humility,  patience,  and  the  burden  of  life.  It  is  interesting  that  the  cross  should  be  both  a <br/>symbol  of  life  and  a  symbol  of  death.  Many  nations  deeply  considered  the  astronomical  aspect  of <br/>religion,  and  it  is  probable  that  the  Persians,  Greeks,  and  Hindus  looked  upon  the  cross  as  a  symbol  of <br/>the  equinoxes  and  the  solstices,  in  the  belief  that  at  certain  seasons  of  the  year  the  sun  was <br/>symbolically  crucified  upon  these  imaginary  celestial  angles. <br/><br/>The  fact  that  so  many  nations  have  regarded  their  Savior  as  a  personification  of  the  sun  globe  is <br/>convincing  evidence  that  the  cross  must  exist  as  an  astronomical  element  in  pagan  allegory.  Augustus <br/>Le  Plongeon  believed  that  the  veneration  for  the  cross  was  partly  due  to  the  rising  of  a  constellation <br/>called  the  Southern  Cross,  which  immediately  preceded  the  annual  rains,  and  as  the  natives  of  those <br/>latitudes  relied  wholly  upon  these  rains  to  raise  their  crops,  they  viewed  the  cross  as  an  annual <br/>promise  of  the  approaching  storms,  which  to  them  meant  life. <br/><br/>There  are  four  basic  elements  (according  to  both  ancient  philosophy  and  modern  science),  and  the <br/>ancients  represented  them  by  the  four  arms  of  the  cross,  placing  at  the  end  of  each  arm  a  mysterious <br/>Qabbalistic  creature  to  sjmibolize  the  power  of  one  of  these  elements.  Thus,  they  symbolized  the <br/>element  of  earth  by  a  bull;  water  by  a  scorpion,  a  serpent,  or  an  eagle;  fire  by  a  lion;  and  air  by  a <br/>human  head  surrounded  by  wings.  It  is  significant  that  the  four  letters  inscribed  upon  parchment <br/>(some  say  wood)  and  fastened  to  the  top  of  the  cross  at  the  time  of  the  crucifixion  should  be  the  first <br/>letters  of  four  Hebrew  words  which  stand  for  the  four  elements:  &quot;lammin,  the  sea  or  water;  Nour,  fire; <br/>Rouach,  the  air;  and  lebeschah,  the  dry  earth.&quot;  (See  Morals  and  Dogma,  by  Albeit  Pike.) <br/><br/>That  a  cross  can  be  formed  by  opening  or  unfolding  the  surfaces  of  a  cube  has  caused  that  symbol  to <br/>be  associated  with  the  earth.  Though  a  cross  within  a  circle  has  long  been  regarded  as  a  sign  of  the <br/>planet  Earth,  it  should  really  be  considered  as  the  symbol  of  the  composite  element  earth,  since  it  is <br/>composed  of  the  four  triangles  of  the  elements.  For  thousands  of  years  the  cross  has  been  identified <br/>with  the  plan  of  salvation  for  humanity.  The  elements&#x2014;salt,  sulphur,  mercury,  and  Azoth&#x2014;used  in <br/>making  the  Philosopher's  Scone  in  Alchemy,  were  often  symbolized  by  a  cross.  The  cross  of  the  four <br/>cardinal  angles  also  had  its  secret  significance,  and  Masonic  parties  of  three  still  go  forth  to  the  four <br/>cardinal  points  of  the  compass  in  search  of  the  Lost  Word. <br/><br/>The  material  of  which  the  cross  was  formed  was  looked  upon  as  being  an  essential  element  in  its <br/>symbolism.  Thus,  a  golden  cross  symbolized  illumination;  a  silver  cross,  purification;  a  cross  of  base <br/>metals,  humiliation;  a  cross  of  wood,  aspiration.  The  fact  that <br/><br/><br/>THE  EASTER  ISLAND  FIGURE  SHOWING  CRUX  ANSATA  ON  REVERSE <br/><br/>That  the  Crux  Ansata  migrated  to  many  parts  of  the  earth  is  proved  by  the  fact  that  it  was  sculptured  upon  the  back  of  at <br/>least  one  of  the  mysterious  stone  figures  found  on  Easter  Island  in  the  south  Pacific.  The  statue  in  question&#x2014;one  of  the <br/>smallest  in  the  group&#x2014;was  brought  to  London  by  a  sailing  ship,  and  is  now  in  the  British  Museum;  the  Crux  Ansata  on  the <br/>reverse  side  is  plainly  visible. <br/><br/>p.  183 <br/><br/>among  many  nations  it  was  customary  to  spread  the  arms  in  prayer  has  influenced  the  symbohsm  of <br/>the  cross,  which,  because  of  its  shape,  has  come  to  be  regarded  as  emblematic  of  the  human  body.  The <br/>four  major  divisions  of  the  human  structure&#x2014;bones,  muscles,  nerves,  and  arteries&#x2014;are  considered  to <br/>have  contributed  to  the  symbolism  of  the  cross.  This  is  especially  due  to  the  fact  that  the  spinal  nerves <br/>cross  at  the  base  of  the  spine,  and  is  a  reminder  that  &quot;Our  Lord  was  crucified  also  in  Egypt.&quot; <br/><br/>Man  has  four  vehicles  (or  mediums)  of  expression  by  means  of  which  the  spiritual  Ego  contacts  the <br/>external  universe:  the  physical  nature,  the  vital  nature,  the  emotional  nature,  and  the  mental  nature. <br/>Each  of  these  partakes  in  principle  of  one  of  the  primary  elements,  and  the  four  creatures  assigned  to <br/>them  by  the  Qabbalists  caused  the  cross  to  be  symbolic  of  the  compound  nature  of  man. <br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIXION--A  COSMIC  ALLEGORY <br/><br/>Saviors  unnumbered  have  died  for  the  sins  of  man  and  by  the  hands  of  man,  and  through  their  deaths <br/>have  interceded  in  heaven  for  the  souls  of  their  executioners.  The  martyrdom  of  the  God-Man  and  the <br/>redemption  of  the  world  through  His  blood  has  been  an  essential  tenet  of  many  great  religions. <br/>Nearly  all  these  stories  can  be  traced  to  sun  worship,  for  the  glorious  orb  of  day  is  the  Savior  who  dies <br/>annually  for  every  creature  within  his  universe,  but  year  after  year  rises  again  victorious  from  the <br/>tomb  of  winter.  Without  doubt  the  doctrine  of  the  crucifixion  is  based  upon  the  secret  traditions  of <br/>the  Ancient  Wisdom;  it  is  a  constant  reminder  that  the  divine  nature  of  man  is  perpetually  crucified <br/>upon  the  animal  organism.  Certain  of  the  pagan  Mysteries  included  in  the  ceremony  of  initiation  the <br/>crucifixion  of  the  candidate  upon  a  cross,  or  the  laying  of  his  body  upon  a  cruciform  altar.  It  has  been <br/>claimed  that  ApoUonius  of  Tyana  (the  Antichrist)  was  initiated  into  the  Arcanum  of  Egypt  in  the <br/>Great  Pyramid,  where  he  hung  upon  a  cross  until  unconscious  and  was  then  laid  in  the  tomb  (the <br/>coffer)  for  three  days.  While  his  body  was  unconscious,  his  soul  was  thought  to  pass  into  the  realms  of <br/>the  immortals  (the  place  of  death)  After  it  had  vanquished  death  (by  recognizing  that  life  is  eternal)  it <br/>returned  again  to  the  body,  which  then  rose  from  the  coffer,  after  which  he  was  hailed  as  a  brother  by <br/>the  priests,  who  believed  that  he  had  returned  from  the  land  of  the  dead.  This  concept  was,  in <br/>substance,  the  teaching  of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIED  SAVIORS <br/><br/><br/>The  list  of  the  deathless  mortals  who  suffered  for  man  that  he  might  receive  the  boon  of  eternal  life  is <br/>an  imposing  one.  Among  those  connected  historically  or  allegorically  with  a  crucifixion  are <br/>Prometheus,  Adonis,  Apollo,  Arys,  Bacchus,  Buddha,  Christna,  Horus,  Indra,  Ixion,  Mithras,  Osiris, <br/>Pythagoras,  Quetzalcoatl,  Semiramis,  and  Jupiter.  According  to  the  fragmentary  accounts  extant,  all <br/>these  heroes  gave  their  lives  to  the  service  of  humanity  and,  with  one  or  two  exceptions,  died  as <br/>martyrs  for  the  cause  of  human  progress.  In  many  mysterious  ways  the  manner  of  their  death  has <br/>been  designedly  concealed,  but  it  is  possible  that  most  of  them  were  crucified  upon  a  cross  or  tree. <br/>The  first  friend  of  man,  the  immortal  Prometheus,  was  crucified  on  the  pinnacle  of  Mount  Caucasus, <br/>and  a  vulture  was  placed  over  his  liver  to  torment  him  throughout  eternity  by  clawing  and  rending  his <br/>flesh  with  its  talons.  Prometheus  disobeyed  the  edict  of  Zeus  by  bringing  fire  and  immortality  to  man, <br/>so  for  man  he  suffered  until  the  coming  of  Hercules  released  him  from  his  ages  of  torment. <br/><br/>Concerning  the  crucifixion  of  the  Persian  Mithras,  J.  P.  Lundy  has  written:  &quot;Dupuis  tells  us  that <br/>Mithra  was  put  to  death  by  crucifixion,  and  rose  again  on  the  25th  of  March.  In  the  Persian  Mysteries <br/>the  body  of  a  young  man,  apparently  dead,  was  exhibited,  which  was  feigned  to  be  restored  to  life.  By <br/>his  sufferings  he  was  believed  to  have  worked  their  salvation,  and  on  this  account  he  was  called  their <br/>Savior.  His  priests  watched  his  tomb  to  the  midnight  of  the  vigil  of  the  25th  of  March,  with  loud  cries, <br/>and  in  darkness;  when  all  at  once  the  light  burst  forth  from  all  parts,  the  priest  cried.  Rejoice,  O <br/>sacred  initiated,  your  God  is  risen.  His  death,  his  pains,  and  sufferings,  have  worked  your  salvation.&quot; <br/>(See  Monumental  Christianity.) <br/><br/>In  some  cases,  as  in  that  of  the  Buddha,  the  crucifixion  mythos  must  be  taken  in  an  allegorical  rather <br/>than  a  literal  sense,  for  the  manner  of  his  death  has  been  recorded  by  his  own  disciples  in  the  Book  of <br/>the  Great  Decease.  However,  the  mere  fact  that  the  symbolic  reference  to  death  upon  a  tree  has  been <br/>associated  with  these  heroes  is  sufficient  to  prove  the  universality  of  the  crucifixion  story. <br/><br/>The  East  Indian  equivalent  of  Christ  is  the  immortal  Christna,  who,  sitting  in  the  forest  playing  his <br/>flute,  charmed  the  birds  and  beasts  by  his  music.  It  is  supposed  that  this  divinely  inspired  Savior  of <br/>humanity  was  crucified  upon  a  tree  by  his  enemies,  but  great  care  has  been  taken  to  destroy  any <br/>evidence  pointing  in  that  direction.  Louis  JacoUiot,  in  his  book  The  Bible  in  India,  thus  describes  the <br/>death  of  Christna:  &quot;Christna  understood  that  the  hour  had  come  for  him  to  quit  the  earth,  and  return <br/>to  the  bosom  of  him  who  had  sent  him.  Forbidding  his  disciples  to  follow  him,  he  went,  one  day,  to <br/>make  his  ablutions  on  the  banks  of  the  Ganges  *  *  *.  Arriving  at  the  sacred  river,  he  plunged  himself <br/>three  times  therein,  then,  kneeling,  and  looking  to  heaven,  he  prayed,  expecting  death.  In  this <br/>position  he  was  pierced  with  arrows  by  one  of  those  whose  crimes  he  had  unveiled,  and  who,  hearing <br/>of  his  journey  to  the  Ganges,  had,  with  generation,  a  strong  troop,  followed  with  the  design  of <br/>assassinating  him  *  *  *.  The  body  of  the  God-man  was  suspended  to  the  branches  of  a  tree  by  his <br/>murderer,  that  it  might  become  the  prey  of  vultures.  News  of  the  death  having  spread,  the  people <br/>came  in  a  crowd  conducted  by  Ardjouna,  the  dearest  of  the  disciples  of  Christna,  to  recover  his  sacred <br/>remains.  But  the  mortal  frame  of  the  redeemer  had  disappeared&#x2014;no  doubt  it  had  regained  the <br/>celestial  abodes  *  *  *  and  the  tree  to  which  it  had  been  attached  had  become  suddenly  covered  with <br/>great  red  flowers  and  diffused  around  it  the  sweetest  perfume.&quot;  Other  accounts  of  the  death  of <br/>Christna  declare  that  he  was  tied  to  a  cross-shaped  tree  before  the  arrows  were  aimed  at  him. <br/><br/>The  existence  in  Moor's  The  Hindu  Pantheon  of  a  plate  of  Christna  with  nail  wounds  in  his  hands  and <br/>feet,  and  a  plate  in  Inman's  Ancient  Faiths  showing  an  Oriental  deity  with  what  might  well  be  a  nail <br/>hole  in  one  of  his  feet,  should  be  sufficient  motive  for  further  investigation  of  this  subject  by  those  of <br/>unbiased  minds.  Concerning  the  startling  discoveries  which  can  be  made  along  these  lines,  J.  P. <br/>Lundy  in  his  Monumental  Christianity  presents  the  following  information:  &quot;Where  did  the  Persians <br/>get  their  notion  of  this  prophecy  as  thus  interpreted  respecting  Christ,  and  His  saving  mercy  and  love <br/>displayed  on  the  cross?  Both  by  symbol  and  actual  crucifix  we  see  it  on  all  their  monuments.  If  it <br/>came  from  India,  how  did  it  get  there,  except  from  the  one  common  and  original  centre  of  all <br/>primitive  and  pure  religion?  There  is  a  most  extraordinary  plate,  illustrative  of  the  whole  subject. <br/><br/><br/>which  representation  I  beUeve  to  be  anterior  to  Christianity.  It  is  copied  from  Moor's  Hindu  Pantheon, <br/><br/>not  as  a  curiosity,  but  as  a  most  singular  monument  of  the  crucifixion.  I  do  not  venture  to  give  it  a <br/>name,  other  than  that  of  a  crucifixion  in  space.  *  *  *  Can  it  be  the  Victim-Man,  or  the  Priest  and <br/>Victim  both  in  one,  of  the  Hindu  mythology,  who  offered  himself  a  sacrifice  before  the  worlds  were? <br/>Can  it  be  Plato's  second  God  who  impressed  himself  on  the  universe  in  the  form  of  the  cross?  Or  is  it <br/>his  divine  man  who  would  be  scourged,  tormented,  fettered,  have  his  eyes  burnt  out;  and  lastly, <br/>having  suffered  all  manner  of  evils,  would  be  crucified?  Plato  learned  his  theology  in  Egypt  and  the <br/>East,  and  must  have  known  of  the  crucifixion  of  Krishna,  Buddha,  Mithra  [et  a/].  At  any  rate,  the <br/>religion  of  India  had  its  mythical  crucified  victim  long  anterior  to  Christianity, <br/><br/><br/>THE  TAU  CROSS. <br/><br/><br/>The  TAU  Cross  was  the  sign  which  the  Lord  told  the  people  of  Jerusalem  to  mark  on  their  foreheads,  as  related  by  the <br/>Prophet  Ezekiel.  It  was  also  placed  as  a  symbol  of  liberation  upon  those  charged  with  crimes  but  acquitted. <br/><br/><br/>THE  CRUX  ANSATA. <br/><br/><br/>Both  the  cross  and  the  circle  were  phallic  symbols,  for  the  ancient  world  venerated  the  generative  powers  of  Nature  as <br/>being  expressive  of  the  creative  attributes  of  the  Deity.  The  Crux  Ansata,  by  combining  the  masculine  TAU  with  the <br/>feminine  oval,  exemplified  the  principles  of  generation. <br/><br/><br/>APOLLONIUS  OF  TYANA. <br/><br/><br/>From  Historia  Deorum  Fatidicorum. <br/><br/>Concerning  ApoUonius  and  his  remarkable  Powers,  Francis  Barrett,  in  his  Biographia  Antiqua,  after  describing  how <br/>ApoUonius  quelled  a  riot  without  speaking  a  word,  continues:  &quot;He  traveled  much,  professed  himself  a  legislator; <br/>understood  all  languages,  without  having  learned  them;  he  had  the  surprising  faculty  of  knowing  what  was  transacted  at <br/>an  immense  distance,  and  at  the  time  the  Emperor  Domitian  was  stabbed,  ApoUonius  being  at  a  vast  distance  and <br/>standing  in  the  market-place  of  the  city,  exclaimed,  'Strike!  strike!~'tis  time,  the  tyrant  is  no  more.'  He  understood  the <br/>language  of  birds;  he  condemned  dancing  and  other  diversions  of  that  sort,  he  recommended  charity  and  piety;  he <br/>traveled  over  almost  all  the  countries  of  the  world;  and  he  died  at  a  very  great  age.&quot; <br/><br/>p.  184 <br/><br/>as  a  type  of  the  real  one  [Pro  Deo  et  Ecclesial],  and  I  am  inclined  to  think  that  we  have  it  in  this <br/>remarkable  plate.&quot; <br/><br/>The  modern  world  has  been  misled  in  its  attitude  towards  the  so-called  pagan  deities,  and  has  come <br/>to  view  them  in  a  light  entirely  different  from  their  true  characters  and  meanings.  The  ridicule  and <br/>slander  heaped  by  Christendom  upon  Christna  and  Bacchus  are  excellent  examples  of  the  persecution <br/>of  immortal  principles  by  those  who  have  utterly  failed  to  sense  the  secret  meaning  of  the  allegories. <br/>Who  was  the  crucified  man  of  Greece,  concerning  whom  vague  rumors  have  been  afloat?  Higgins <br/>thinks  it  was  Pythagoras,  the  true  story  of  whose  death  was  suppressed  by  early  Christian  authors <br/>because  it  conflicted  with  their  teachings.  Was  it  true  also  that  the  Roman  legionaries  carried  on  the <br/>field  of  battle  standards  upon  which  were  crosses  bearing  the  crucified  Sun  Man? <br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIXION  OF  QUETZALCOATL <br/><br/>One  of  the  most  remarkable  of  the  crucified  World  Saviors  is  the  Central  American  god  of  the  winds, <br/>or  the  Sun,  Quetzalcoatl,  concerning  whose  activities  great  secrecy  was  maintained  by  the  Indian <br/>priests  of  Mexico  and  Central  America.  This  strange  immortal,  whose  name  means  feathered  snake, <br/>appears  to  have  come  out  of  the  sea,  bringing  with  him  a  mysterious  cross.  On  his  garments  were <br/><br/><br/>embellished  clouds  and  red  crosses.  In  his  honor,  great  serpents  carved  from  stone  were  placed  in <br/>different  parts  of  Mexico. <br/><br/>The  cross  of  Quetzalcoatl  became  a  sacred  symbol  among  the  Mayas,  and  according  to  available <br/>records  the  Maya  Indian  angels  had  crosses  of  various  pigments  painted  on  their  foreheads.  Similar <br/>crosses  were  placed  over  the  eyes  of  those  initiated  into  their  Mysteries.  When  Cortez  arrived  in <br/>Mexico,  he  brought  with  him  the  cross.  Recognizing  this,  the  natives  believed  that  he  was <br/>Quetzalcoatl  returned,  for  the  latter  had  promised  to  come  back  in  the  infinite  future  and  redeem  his <br/>people. <br/><br/>In  Anacalypsis,  Godfrey  Higgins  throws  some  light  on  the  cross  and  its  symbolism  in  America:  &quot;The <br/>Incas  had  a  cross  of  very  fine  marble,  or  beautiful  jasper,  highly  polished,  of  one  piece,  three-fourths <br/>of  an  ell  in  length,  and  three  fingers  in  width  and  thickness.  It  was  kept  in  a  sacred  chamber  of  a <br/>palace,  and  held  in  great  veneration.  The  Spaniards  enriched  this  cross  with  gold  and  jewels,  and <br/>placed  it  in  the  cathedral  of  Cuzco.  Mexican  temples  are  in  the  form  of  a  cross,  and  face  the  four <br/>cardinal  points.  Quexalcoatl  is  represented  in  the  paintings  of  the  Codex  Borgianus  nailed  to  the  cross. <br/>Sometimes  even  the  two  thieves  are  there  crucified  with  him.  In  Vol.  II.  plate  75,  the  God  is  crucified <br/>in  the  Heavens,  in  a  circle  of  nineteen  figures,  the  number  of  the  Metonic  cycle.  A  serpent  is  depriving <br/>him  of  the  organs  of  generation.  In  the  Codex  Borgianus,  (pp.  4,  72,  73,  75,)  the  Mexican  God  is <br/>represented  crucified  and  nailed  to  the  cross,  and  in  another  place  hanging  to  it,  with  a  cross  in  his <br/>hands.  And  in  one  instance,  where  the  figure  is  not  merely  outlined,  the  cross  is  red,  the  clothes  are <br/>coloured,  and  the  face  and  hands  quite  black.  If  this  was  the  Christianity  of  the  German  Nestorius, <br/>how  came  he  to  teach  that  the  crucified  Savior  was  black?  The  name  of  the  God  who  was  crucified  was <br/>Quexalcoatl. <br/><br/>The  crucifixion  of  the  Word  in  space,  the  crucifixion  of  the  dove  often  seen  in  religious  symbolism&#x2014; <br/>both  of  these  are  reminders  of  pagan  overshadowing.  The  fact  that  a  cross  is  formed  by  the  spread <br/>wings  of  a  bird  in  relation  to  its  body  is  no  doubt  one  of  the  reasons  why  the  Egyptians  used  a  bird  to <br/>symbolize  the  immortal  nature  of  man,  and  often  show  it  hovering  over  the  mummified  body  of  the <br/>dead  and  carrying  in  one  of  its  claws  the  sign  of  life  and  in  the  other  the  sign  of  breath. <br/><br/>THE  NAILS  OF  THE  PASSION <br/><br/>The  three  nails  of  the  Passion  have  found  their  way  into  the  symbolism  of  many  races  and  faiths. <br/>There  are  many  legends  concerning  these  nails.  One  of  these  is  to  the  effect  that  originally  there  were <br/>four  nails,  but  one  was  dematerialized  by  a  Hebrew  Qabbalist  and  magician  just  as  they  were  about  to <br/>drive  it  through  the  foot  of  the  Master.  Hence  it  was  necessary  to  cross  the  feet.  Another  legend <br/>relates  that  one  of  the  nails  was  hammered  into  a  crown  and  that  it  still  exists  as  the  imperial  diadem <br/>of  a  European  house.  Still  another  story  has  it  that  the  bit  on  the  bridle  of  Constantine's  horse  was  a <br/>Passion  nail.  It  is  improbable,  however,  that  the  nails  were  made  of  iron,  for  at  that  time  it  was <br/>customary  to  use  sharpened  wooden  pegs.  Hargrave  Jennings,  in  his  Rosicrucians,  Their  Rites  and <br/>Mysteries,  calls  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  mark  or  sign  used  in  England  to  designate  royal  property <br/>and  called  the  broad  arrow  is  nothing  more  nor  less  than  the  three  nails  of  the  crucifixion  grouped <br/>together,  and  that  by  placing  them  point  to  point  the  ancient  symbol  of  the  Egyptian  TAU  cross  is <br/>formed. <br/><br/>In  his  Ancient  Freemasonry,  Frank  C.  Higgins  reproduces  the  Masonic  apron  of  a  colossal  stone <br/>figure  at  Quirigua,  Guatemala.  The  central  ornament  of  the  apron  is  the  three  Passion  nails,  arranged <br/>exactly  like  the  British  broad  arrow.  That  three  nails  should  be  used  to  cruelty  the  Christ,  three <br/>murderers  to  kill  CHiram  Abiff,  and  three  wounds  to  slay  Prince  Coh,  the  Mexican  Indian  Osiris,  is <br/>significant. <br/><br/><br/>C.  W.  King,  in  his  Gnostics  and  Their  Remains,  thus  describes  a  Gnostic  gem:  &quot;The  Gnostic  Pleroma, <br/>or  combination  of  all  the  ^ons  [is]  expressed  by  the  outline  of  a  man  holding  a  scroll  *  *  *.  The  left <br/>hand  is  formed  like  three  bent  spikes  or  nails;  unmistakably  the  same  symbol  that  Belus  often  holds <br/>in  his  extended  hand  on  the  Babylonian  cylinders,  afterwards  discovered  by  the  Jewish  Cabalists  in <br/>the  points  of  the  letter  Shin,  and  by  the  mediaeval  mystics  in  o  the  Three  Nails  of  the  Cross.&quot;  From  this <br/>point  Hargrave  Jennings  continues  King's  speculations,  noting  the  resemblance  of  the  nail  to  an <br/>obelisk,  or  pillar,  and  that  the  Qabbalistic  value  of  the  Hebrew  letter  Shin,  or  Sin,  is  300,  namely,  100 <br/>for  each  spike. <br/><br/>The  Passion  nails  are  highly  important  symbols,  especially  when  it  is  realized  that,  according  to  the <br/>esoteric  systems  of  culture,  there  are  certain  secret  centers  of  force  in  the  palms  of  the  hands  and  in <br/>the  soles  of  the  feet. <br/><br/>The  driving  of  the  nails  and  the  flow  of  blood  and  water  from  the  wounds  were  symbolic  of  certain <br/>secret  philosophic  practices  of  the  Temple.  Many  of  the  Oriental  deities  have  mysterious  symbols  on <br/>the  hands  and  feet.  The  so-called  footprints  of  Buddha  are  usually  embellished  with  a  magnificent <br/>sunburst  at  the  point  where  the  nail  pierced  the  foot  of  Christ. <br/><br/>In  his  notes  on  the  theology  of  Jakob  Bohme,  Dr.  Franz  Hartmann  thus  sums  up  the  mystic <br/>symbolism  of  the  crucifixion:  &quot;The  cross  represents  terrestrial  life,  and  the  crown  of  thorns  the <br/>sufferings  of  the  soul  within  the  elementary  body,  but  also  the  victory  of  the  spirit  over  the  elements <br/>of  darkness.  The  body  is  naked,  to  indicate  that  the  candidate  for  immortality  must  divest  himself  of <br/>all  desires  for  terrestrial  things.  The  figure  is  nailed  to  the  cross,  which  symbolizes  the  death  and <br/>surrender  of  the  self-will,  and  that  it  should  not  attempt  to  accomplish  anything  by  its  own  power,  but <br/>merely  serve  as  an  instrument  wherein  the  Divine  will  is  executed.  Above  the  head  are  inscribed  the <br/>letters:  I.  N.  R.  J.  whose  most  important  meaning  is:  In  Nobis  Regnat  Jesus  (Within  ourselves  reigns <br/>Jesus).  But  this  signification  of  this  inscription  can  be  practically  known  only  to  those  who  have <br/>actually  died  relatively  to  the  world  of  desires,  and  risen  above  the  temptation  for  personal  existence; <br/>or,  to  express  it  in  other  words,  those  who  have  become  alive  in  Christ,  and  in  whom  thus  the <br/>kingdom  of  Jesus  (the  holy  love-will  issuing  from  the  heart  of  God)  has  been  established.&quot;  One  of  the <br/>most  interesting  interpretations  of  the  crucifixion  allegory  is  that  which  identifies  the  man  Jesus  with <br/>the  personal  consciousness  of  the  individual.  It  is  this  personal  consciousness  that  conceives  of  and <br/>dwells  in  the  sense  of  separateness,  and  before  the  aspiring  soul  can  be  reunited  with  the  ever-present <br/>and  all-pervading  Father  this  personality  must  be  sacrificed  that  the  Universal  Consciousness  may  be <br/>liberated. <br/><br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIXION  OF  QUETZALCOATL. <br/>(From  the  Codex  Borgianus.) <br/><br/><br/>From  Kingsborough's  Antiquities  of  Mexico. <br/><br/><br/>Lord  Kingsborough  writes:  &quot;May  we  not  refer  to  the  seventy-third  page  of  the  Borgian  MS.,  which  represents  Quexalcoatl <br/>both  crucified,  and  as  it  were  cut  in  pieces  for  the  cauldron,  and  with  equal  reason  demand,  whether  anyone  can  help <br/>thinking  that  the  Jews  of  the  New  World  (Lord  Kingsborough  sought  to  prove  that  the  Mexicans  were  descendants  of  the <br/>Jews]  applied  to  their  Messiah  not  only  all  the  prophecies  contained  in  the  Old  Testament  relating  to  Christ,  but  likewise <br/>many  of  the  incidents  recorded  of  him  in  the  Gospels.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Of  this  remarkable  Oriental  drawing,  J.  P.  Lundy  has  written: &#x2014; It  looks  like  a  Christian  crucifix  in  many  respects,  and  in <br/>some  others  it  does  not.  The  drawing,  attitude,  and  the  nail-marks  in  hands  and  feet,  indicate  a  Christian  origin;  while  the <br/>Parthian  coronet  of  seven  points,  the  absence  of  the  wood  and  of  the  usual  inscription,  and  the  rays  of  glory  above  seem  to <br/>point  to  some  Christian  origin.  Can  it  be  the  Victim,  Man,  or  the  Priest  and  Victim  both  in  one,  of  the  Hindu  m)1:hology, <br/>who  offered  himself  a  sacrifice  before  the  worlds  were?&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  CRUCIFIXION  IN  SPACE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Higgins'  Anacalypsis. <br/><br/><br/>p.  185 <br/><br/><br/>The  Mystery  of  the  Apocalypse <br/><br/>THE  presence  of  the  Temple  of  Diana  at  Ephesus  marked  that  city  as  sacred  to  the  Mystery  rehgion, <br/>for  the  Seven  Wonders  of  the  ancient  world  were  erected  to  indicate  the  repositories  of  recondite <br/>knowledge.  Of  Ephesus,  H.  P.  Blavatsky  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;It  was  a  focus  of  the  universal  'secret'  doctrines;  the  weird  laboratory  whence,  fashioned  in  elegant <br/>Grecian  phraseology,  sprang  the  quintessence  of  Buddhistic,  Zoroastrian,  and  Chaldean  philosophy. <br/>Artemis,  the  gigantic  concrete  symbol  of  theosophico-pantheistic  abstractions,  the  great  mother <br/>Multimamma,  androgyne  and  patroness  of  the  'Ephesian  writings,'  was  conquered  by  Paul;  but <br/>although  the  zealous  converts  of  the  apostles  pretended  to  burn  all  their  books  on  'curious  arts,  xa <br/>jtepiepya,  enough  of  these  remained  for  them  to  study  when  their  first  zeal  had  cooled  off.&quot;  (See  Isis <br/>Unveiled.) <br/><br/>Being  a  great  center  of  pagan  learning,  Ephesus  has  been  the  locale  for  many  early  Christian  myths. <br/>The  assertion  has  been  made  that  it  was  the  last  domicile  of  the  Virgin  Mary;  also  that  the  tomb  of  St. <br/>John  the  Divine  was  located  there.  According  to  legend,  St.  John  did  not  depart  from  this  life  in  the <br/>usual  manner  but,  selecting  his  vault,  entered  it  while  still  alive,  and  closing  the  entrance  behind  him, <br/>vanished  forever  from  mortal  sight.  A  rumor  was  current  in  ancient  Ephesus  that  St.  John  would <br/>sleep  in  his  tomb  until  the  return  of  the  Savior,  and  that  when  the  apostle  turned  over  on  his <br/>sepulchral  couch  the  earth  above  moved  like  the  coverlets  of  a  bed. <br/><br/>Subjected  to  more  criticism  than  any  other  book  now  incorporated  in  the  New  Testament,  the <br/>Apocalypse&#x2014;popularly  accredited  to  St.  John  the  Divine&#x2014;is  by  far  the  most  important  but  least <br/>understood  of  the  Gnostic  Christian  writings.  Though  Justin  Martyr  declared  the  Book  of  Revelation <br/>to  have  been  written  by  &quot;John,  one  of  Christ's  apostles,&quot;  its  authorship  was  disputed  as  early  as  the <br/>second  century  after  Christ.  In  the  third  century  these  contentions  became  acute  and  even  Dionysius <br/>of  Alexandria  and  Eusebius  attacked  the  Johannine  theory,  declaring  that  both  the  Book  of  Revelation <br/>and  the  Gospel  according  to  St.  John  were  written  by  one  Cerinthus,  who  borrowed  the  name  of  the <br/>great  apostle  the  better  to  foist  his  own  doctrines  upon  the  Christians.  Later  Jerome  questioned  the <br/>authorship  of  the  Apocalypse  and  during  the  Reformation  his  objections  were  revived  by  Luther  and <br/>Erasmus.  The  once  generally  accepted  notion  that  the  Book  of  Revelation  was  the  actual  record  of  a <br/>&quot;mystical  experience&quot;  occurring  to  St.  John  while  that  seer  was  an  exile  in  the  Isle  of  Parmos  is  now <br/>regarded  with  disfavor  by  more  critical  scholars.  Other  explanations  have  therefore  been  advanced  to <br/>account  for  the  symbolism  permeating  the  volume  and  the  original  motive  for  its  writing.  The  more <br/>reasonable  of  these  theories  may  be  summed  up  as  follows: <br/><br/>First,  upon  the  weight  of  evidence  furnished  by  its  own  contents  the  Book  of  Revelation  may  well  be <br/>pronounced  a  pagan  writing&#x2014; one  of  the  sacred  books  of  the  Eleusinian  or  Phrygian  Mysteries.  As  a <br/>corollary,  the  real  author  of  a  work  setting  forth  the  profundities  of  Egyptian  and  Greek  mysticism <br/>must  have  been  an  initiate  himself  and  consequently  obligated  to  write  only  in  the  symbolic  language <br/>of  the  Mysteries. <br/><br/>Second,  it  is  possible  that  the  Book  of  Revelation  was  written  to  reconcile  the  seeming  discrepancies <br/>between  the  early  Christian  and  pagan  religious  philosophies.  When  the  zealots  of  the  primitive <br/>Christian  Church  sought  to  Christianize  pagandom,  the  pagan  initiates  retorted  with  a  powerful  effort <br/>to  paganize  Christianity.  The  Christians  failed  but  the  pagans  succeeded.  With  the  decline  of <br/>paganism  the  initiated  pagan  hierophants  transferred  their  base  of  operations  to  the  new  vehicle  of <br/>primitive  Christianity,  adopting  the  symbols  of  the  new  cult  to  conceal  those  eternal  verities  which  are <br/>ever  the  priceless  possession  of  the  wise.  The  Apocalypse  shows  clearly  the  resultant  fusion  of  pagan <br/><br/><br/>and  Christian  symbolism  and  thus  bears  irrefutable  evidence  of  the  activities  of  these  initiated  minds <br/>operating  through  early  Christianity. <br/><br/>Third,  the  theory  has  been  advanced  that  the  Book  of  Revelation  represents  the  attempt  made  by  the <br/>unscrupulous  members  of  a  certain  religious  order  to  undermine  the  Christian  Mysteries  by  satirizing <br/>their  philosophy.  This  nefarious  end  they  hoped  to  attain  by  showing  the  new  faith  to  be  merely  a <br/>restatement  of  the  ancient  pagan  doctrines,  by  heaping  ridicule  upon  Christianity,  and  by  using  its <br/>own  symbols  toward  its  disparagement.  For  example,  the  star  which  fell  to  earth  (Rev.  viii.  lo-ii) <br/>could  be  construed  to  mean  the  Star  of  Bethlehem,  and  the  bitterness  of  that  star  (called  Wormwood <br/>and  which  poisoned  mankind)  could  signify  the  &quot;false&quot;  teachings  of  the  Christian  Church.  While  the <br/>last  theory  has  gained  a  certain  measure  of  popularity,  the  profundity  of  the  Apocalypse  leads  the <br/>discerning  reader  to  the  inevitable  conclusion  that  this  is  the  least  plausible  of  the  three  hypotheses. <br/>To  those  able  to  pierce  the  veil  of  its  symbolism,  the  inspired  source  of  the  document  requires  no <br/>further  corroborative  evidence. <br/><br/>In  the  final  analysis,  true  philosophy  can  be  limited  by  neither  creed  nor  faction;  in  fact  it  is <br/>incompatible  with  every  artificial  limitation  of  human  thought.  The  question  of  the  pagan  or  Christian <br/>origin  of  the  Book  of  Revelation  is,  consequently,  of  little  importance.  The  intrinsic  value  of  the  book <br/>lies  in  its  magnificent  epitome  of  the  Universal  Mystery&#x2014;an  observation  which  led  St.  Jerome  to <br/>declare  that  it  is  susceptible  of  seven  entirely  different  interpretations.  Untrained  in  the  reaches  of <br/>ancient  thought,  the  modem  theologian  cannot  possibly  cope  with  the  complexities  of  the  Apocalypse, <br/>for  to  him  this  mystic  writing  is  but  a  phantasmagoria  the  divine  inspiration  of  which  he  is  sorely <br/>tempted  to  question.  In  the  limited  space  here  available  it  is  possible  to  sketch  but  briefly  a  few  of  the <br/>salient  features  of  the  vision  of  the  seer  of  Patmos.  A  careful  consideration  of  the  various  pagan <br/>Mysteries  will  assist  materially  also  in  filling  the  inevitable  gaps  in  this  abridgment. <br/><br/>In  the  opening  chapter  of  the  Apocalypse,  St.  John  describes  the  Alpha  and  Omega  who  stood  in  the <br/>midst  of  the  seven  golden  candlesticks.  Surrounded  by  his  flaming  planetary  regents,  this  Sublime <br/>One  thus  epitomizes  in  one  impressive  and  mysterious  figure  the  entire  sweep  of  humanity's <br/>evolutionary  growth&#x2014;past,  present,  and  future. <br/><br/>&quot;The  first  stages  of  man's  earthly  development,&quot;  writes  Dr.  Rudolph  Stein er,  &quot;ran  their  course  at  a <br/>period  when  the  earth  was  still  'fiery';  and  the  first  human  incarnations  were  formed  out  of  the <br/>element  of  fire;  at  the  end  of  his  earthly  career  man  will  himself  radiate  his  inner  being  outwards <br/>creatively  by  the  force  of  the  element  of  fire.  This  continuous  development  from  the  beginning  to  the <br/>end  of  the  earth  reveals  itself  to  the  'seer,'  when  he  sees  on  the  astral  plane  the  archetype  of  evolving <br/>man.  *  *  *  The  beginning  of  earthly  evolution  stands  forth  in  the  fiery  feet,  its  end  in  the  fiery <br/>countenance,  and  the  complete  power  of  the  'creative  word,'  to  be  finally  won,  is  seen  in  the  fiery <br/>source  coming  out  of  the  mouth.&quot;  (See  Occult  Seals  and  Columns.) <br/><br/>In  his  Restored  New  Testament,  James  Morgan  Pryse  traces  the <br/><br/><br/>THE  THRONE  OF  GOD  AND  OF  THE  LAMB. <br/><br/><br/>From  Jacob  Behmen's  Works. <br/><br/>Before  the  throne  of  God  was  the  crystal  sea  representing  the  Schamayim,  or  the  hving  waters  which  are  above  the <br/>heavens.  Before  the  throne  also  were  four  creatures&#x2014;a  bull,  a  lion,  an  eagle,  and  a  man.  These  represented  the  four <br/>corners  of  creation  and  the  multitude  of  eyes  with  which  they  were  covered  are  the  stars  of  the  firmament.  The  twenty- <br/>four  elders  have  the  same  significance  as  the  priests  gathered  around  the  statue  of  Ceres  in  the  Greater  Eleusinian  Rite <br/>and  also  the  Persian  Genii,  or  gods  of  the  hours  of  the  day,  who,  casting  away  their  crowns,  glorify  the  Holy  One.  As <br/>symbolic  of  the  divisions  of  time,  the  elders  adore  the  timeless  and  enduring  Spirit  in  the  midst  of  them. <br/><br/>p.  186 <br/><br/>relationship  of  the  various  parts  of  the  Alpha  and  Omega  to  the  seven  sacred  planets  of  the  ancients. <br/>To  quote: <br/><br/>&quot;The  Logos-figure  described  is  a  composite  picture  of  the  seven  sacred  planets:  he  has  the  snowy- <br/>white  hair  of  Kronos  ('Father  Time'),  the  blazing  eyes  of  'wide-seeing'  Zeus,  the  sword  of  Arcs,  the <br/>shining  face  of  Helios,  and  the  chiton  and  girdle  of  Aphrodite;  his  feet  are  of  mercury,  the  metal <br/>sacred  to  Hermes,  and  his  voice  is  like  the  murmur  of  the  ocean's  waves  (the  'many  waters'),  alluding <br/>to  Selene,  the  Moon-Goddess  of  the  four  seasons  and  of  the  waters.&quot; <br/><br/>The  seven  stars  carried  by  this  immense  Being  in  his  right  hand  are  the  Governors  of  the  world;  the <br/>flaming  sword  issuing  from  his  mouth  is  the  Creative  Fiat,  or  Word  of  Power,  by  which  the  illusion  of <br/>material  permanence  is  slain.  Here  also  is  represented,  in  all  his  symbolic  splendor,  the  hierophant  of <br/>the  Phrygian  Mysteries,  his  various  insignia  emblematic  of  his  divine  attributes.  Seven  priests  bearing <br/>lamps  are  his  attendants  and  the  stars  carried  in  his  hand  are  the  seven  schools  of  the  Mysteries <br/>whose  power  he  administers.  As  one  born  again  out  of  spiritual  darkness,  into  perfect  wisdom,  this <br/>archimagus  is  made  to  say:  &quot;I  am  he  that  liveth,  and  was  dead;  and,  behold,  I  am  alive  forever  more. <br/>Amen;  and  have  the  keys  of  hell  and  of  death.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  second  and  third  chapters  St.  John  delivers  to  the  &quot;seven  churches  which  are  in  Asia&quot;  the <br/>injunctions  received  by  him  from  the  Alpha  and  Omega.  The  churches  are  here  analogous  to  the <br/><br/><br/>rungs  of  a  Mithraic  ladder,  and  John,  being  &quot;in  the  spirit,&quot;  ascended  through  the  orbits  of  the  seven <br/>sacred  planets  until  he  reached  the  inner  surface  of  the  Empyrean. <br/><br/>&quot;After  the  soul  of  the  prophet,&quot;  writes  the  anonymous  author  of  Mankind:  Their  Origin  and  Destiny, <br/>&quot;in  his  ecstatic  state  has  passed  in  its  rapid  flight  through  the  seven  spheres,  from  the  sphere  of  the <br/>moon  to  that  of  Saturn,  or  from  the  planet  which  corresponds  to  Cancer,  the  gate  of  men,  to  that  of <br/>Capricorn,  which  is  the  gate  of  the  gods,  a  new  gate  opens  to  him  in  the  highest  heaven,  and  in  the <br/>zodiac,  beneath  which  the  seven  planets  revolve;  in  a  word,  in  the  firmament,  or  that  which  the <br/>ancients  called  crystallinum  primum,  or  the  crystal  heaven.&quot; <br/><br/>When  related  to  the  Eastern  system  of  metaphysics,  these  churches  represent  the  chakras,  or  nerve <br/>ganglia,  along  the  human  spine,  the  &quot;door  in  heaven&quot;  being  the  brahmarandra,  or  point  in  the  crown <br/>of  the  skull  (Golgotha),  through  which  the  spinal  spirit  fire  passes  to  liberation.  The  church  of <br/>Ephesus  corresponds  to  the  muladhara,  or  sacral  ganglion,  and  the  other  churches  to  the  higher <br/>ganglia  according  to  the  order  given  in  Revelation.  Dr.  Steiner  discovers  a  relationship  between  the <br/>seven  churches  and  the  divisions  of  the  Aryan  race.  Thus,  the  church  of  Ephesus  stands  for  the  Arch- <br/>Indian  branch;  the  church  of  Smyrna,  the  Arch-Persians;  the  church  of  Pergamos,  the  Chaldean- <br/>Egyptian-Semitic;  the  church  of  Thyatira,  the  Grecian-Latin-Roman;  the  church  of  Sardis,  the <br/>Teuton-Anglo-Saxon;  the  church  of  Philadelphia,  the  Slavic;  and  the  church  of  Laodicea,  the <br/>Manichsean.  The  seven  churches  also  signify  the  Greek  vowels,  of  which  Alpha  and  Omega  are  the <br/>first  and  the  last.  A  difference  of  opinion  exists  as  to  the  order  in  which  the  seven  planers  should  be <br/>related  to  the  churches.  Some  proceed  from  the  hypothesis  that  Saturn  represents  the  church  of <br/>Ephesus;  but  from  the  fact  that  this  city  was  sacred  to  the  moon  goddess  and  also  that  the  sphere  of <br/>the  moon  is  the  first  above  that  of  the  earth,  the  planets  obviously  should  ascend  in  their  ancient <br/>order  from  the  moon  to  Saturn.  From  Saturn  the  soul  would  naturally  ascend  through  the  door  in  the <br/>Empyrean. <br/><br/>In  the  fourth  and  fifth  chapters  St.  John  describes  the  throne  of  God  upon  which  sat  the  Holy  One <br/>&quot;which  was  and  is,  and  is  to  come.&quot;  About  the  throne  were  twenty-four  lesser  seats  upon  which  sat <br/>twenty-four  elders  arrayed  in  white  garments  and  wearing  crowns  of  gold.  &quot;And  out  of  the  throne <br/>proceeded  lightnings  and  thunderings  and  voices:  and  there  were  seven  lamps  of  fire  burning  before <br/>the  throne,  which  are  the  seven  Spirits  of  God.&quot;  He  who  sat  upon  the  throne  held  in  His  right  hand  a <br/>book  sealed  with  seven  seals  which  no  man  in  heaven  or  earth  had  been  found  worthy  to  open.  Then <br/>appeared  a  Lamb  (Aries,  the  first  and  chief  of  the  zodiacal  signs)  which  had  been  slain,  having  seven <br/>horns  (rays)  and  seven  eyes  (lights).  The  Lamb  took  the  book  from  the  right  hand  of  Him  that  sat <br/>upon  the  throne  and  the  four  beasts  and  all  the  elders  fell  down  and  worshiped  God  and  the  Lamb. <br/>During  the  early  centuries  of  the  Christian  Church  the  lamb  was  universally  recognized  as  the  symbol <br/>of  Christ,  and  not  until  after  the  fifth  synod  of  Constantinople  (the  &quot;Quinisext  Synod,&quot;  A.D.  692)  was <br/>the  figure  of  the  crucified  man  substituted  for  that  of  Agnus  Dei.  As  shrewdly  noted  by  one  writer  on <br/>the  subject,  the  use  of  a  lamb  is  indicative  of  the  Persian  origin  of  Christianity,  for  the  Persians  were <br/>the  only  people  to  symbolize  the  first  sign  of  the  zodiac  by  a  lamb. <br/><br/>Because  a  lamb  was  the  sin  offering  of  the  ancient  pagans,  the  early  mystic  Christians  considered  this <br/>animal  as  an  appropriate  emblem  of  Christ,  whom  they  regarded  as  the  sin  offering  of  the  world.  The <br/>Greeks  and  the  Egyptians  highly  venerated  the  lamb  or  ram,  often  placing  its  horns  upon  the <br/>foreheads  of  their  gods.  The  Scandinavian  god  Thor  carried  a  hammer  made  from  a  pair  of  ram's <br/>horns.  The  lamb  is  used  in  preference  to  the  ram  apparently  because  of  its  purity  and  gentleness;  also, <br/>since  the  Creator  Himself  was  symbolized  by  Aries,  His  Son  would  consequently  be  the  little  Ram  or <br/>Lamb.  The  lambskin  apron  worn  by  the  Freemasons  over  that  part  of  the  body  symbolized  by  Typhon <br/>or  Judas  represents  that  purification <br/><br/><br/>EPISODES  FROM  THE  MYSTERIES  OF  THE  APOCALYPSE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Klauber's  Historiae  Biblicae  Veteris  etNovi  Testamenti. <br/><br/>In  the  central  foreground,  St.  John  the  Divine  is  kneehng  before  the  apparition  of  the  Alpha  and  Omega  standing  in  the <br/>midst  of  the  seven  lights  and  surrounded  by  an  aureole  of  flames  and  smoke.  In  the  heavens  above  the  twenty-four  elders <br/>with  their  harps  and  censers  bow  before  the  throne  of  the  Ancient  One,  from  whose  hand  the  Lamb  is  taking  the  book <br/>sealed  with  seven  seals.  The  seven  spirit,  of  God,  in  the  form  of  cups  from  which  issue  tongues  of  fire,  surround  the  head <br/>of  the  Ancient  One,  and  the  four  beasts  (the  cherubim)  kneel  at  the  corners  of  His  throne.  In  the  upper  left-hand  corner <br/>are  shown  the  seven  angels  bearing  the  trumpets  and  also  the  altar  of  God  and  the  angel  with  the  censer.  In  the  upper <br/>right  are  the  spirits  of  the  winds;  below  them  is  the  virgin  clothed  wit  h  the  sun,  to  whom  wings  were  given  that  she  might <br/>fly  into  the  wilderness.  To  her  right  is  a  scene  representing  the  spirits  of  God  hurling  the  evil  serpent  into  the  bottomless <br/>pit.  At  the  lower  left  St.  John  is  shown  receiving  from  the  angelic  figure,  whose  legs  are  pillars  of  fire  and  whose  face  is  a <br/>shining  sun,  the  little  book  which  he  is  told  to  eat  if  he  would  understand  the  mysteries  of  the  spiritual  life. <br/><br/>The  plate  also  contains  a  number  of  other  symbols,  including  episodes  from  the  destruction  of  the  world  and  the  crystal <br/>sea  pouring  forth  from  the  throne  of  God.  By  the  presentation  of  such  symbolic  conceptions  in  the  form  of  rituals  and <br/>dramatic  episodes  the  secrets  of  the  Phrygian  Mysteries  were  perpetuated.  When  these  sacred  pageantries  were  thus <br/>revealed  to  all  mankind  indiscriminately  and  each  human  soul  was  appointed  it  own  initiator  into  the  holy  rite,  of  the <br/>philosophic  life,  a  boon  was  conferred  upon  humanity  which  cannot  be  fully  appreciated  until  men  and  women  have <br/>grown  more  responsive  to  those  mysteries  which  are  of  the  spirit. <br/><br/>p.  187 <br/><br/>of  the  generative  processes  which  is  a  prerequisite  to  true  spirituahty.  In  this  allegory  the  Lamb <br/>signifies  the  purified  candidate,  its  seven  horns  representing  the  divisions  of  illuminated  reason  and <br/>its  seven  eyes  the  chakras,  or  perfected  sense-perceptions. <br/><br/>The  sixth  to  eleventh  chapters  inclusive  are  devoted  to  an  account  of  the  opening  of  the  seven  seals  on <br/>the  book  held  by  the  Lamb.  When  the  first  seal  was  broken,  there  rode  forth  a  man  on  a  white  horse <br/>wearing  a  crown  and  holding  in  his  hand  a  bow.  When  the  second  seal  was  broken,  there  rode  forth  a <br/>man  upon  a  red  horse  and  in  his  hand  was  a  great  sword.  When  the  third  seal  was  broken  there  rode <br/>forth  a  man  upon  a  black  horse  and  with  a  pair  of  balances  in  his  hand.  And  when  the  fourth  seal  was <br/>broken  there  rode  forth  Death  upon  a  pale  horse  and  hell  followed  after  him.  The  four  horsemen  of <br/>the  Apocalypse  may  be  interpreted  to  signify  the  four  main  divisions  of  human  life.  Birth  is <br/>represented  by  the  rider  on  the  white  horse  who  comes  forth  conquering  and  to  conquer;  the <br/>impetuosity  of  youth  by  the  rider  on  the  red  horse  who  took  peace  from  the  earth;  maturity  by  the <br/>rider  on  the  black  horse  who  weighs  all  things  in  the  scales  of  reason;  and  death  by  the  rider  on  the <br/>pale  horse  who  was  given  power  over  a  fourth  part  of  the  earth.  In  the  Eastern  philosophy  these <br/>horsemen  signify  the  four  yugas,  or  ages,  of  the  world  which,  riding  forth  at:  their  appointed  times, <br/>become  for  a  certain  span  the  rulers  of  creation. <br/><br/>Commenting  on  the  twenty-fourth  allocution  of  Chrysostom,  in  The  Origin  of  all  Religious  Worship, <br/>Dupuis  notes  that  each  of  the  four  elements  was  represented  by  a  horse  bearing  the  name  of  the  god <br/><br/><br/>&quot;who  is  set  over  the  element.&quot;  The  first  horse,  signifying  the  fire  ether,  was  called  Jupiter  and <br/><br/>occupied  the  highest  place  in  the  order  of  the  elements.  This  horse  was  winged,  very  fleet,  and, <br/>describing  the  largest  circle,  encompassed  all  the  others.  It  shone  with  the  purest  light,  and  on  its <br/>body  were  the  images  of  the  sun,  the  moon,  the  stars,  and  all  the  bodies  in  the  ethereal  regions.  The <br/>second  horse,  signifying  the  element  of  air,  was  Juno.  It  was  inferior  to  the  horse  of  Jupiter  and <br/>described  a  smaller  circle;  its  color  was  black  but  that  part  exposed  to  the  sun  became  luminous,  thus <br/>signifying  the  diurnal  and  nocturnal  conditions  of  air.  The  third  horse,  symbolizing  the  element  of <br/>water,  was  sacred  to  Neptune.  It  was  of  heavy  gait  and  described  a  very  small  circle.  The  fourth  horse, <br/>signifying  the  static  element  of  earth,  described  as  immovable  and  champing  its  bit,  was  the  steed  of <br/>Vesta.  Despite  their  differences  in  temperature,  these  four  horses  lived  harmoniously  together,  which <br/>is  in  accord  with  the  principles  of  the  philosophers,  who  declared  the  world  to  be  preserved  by  the <br/>concord  and  harmony  of  its  elements.  In  time,  however,  the  racing  horse  of  Jupiter  burned  the  mane <br/>of  the  horse  of  earth;  the  thundering  steed  of  Neptune  also  became  covered  with  sweat,  which <br/>overflowed  the  immovable  horse  of  Vesta  and  resulted  in  the  deluge  of  Deucalion.  At  last  the  fiery <br/>horse  of  Jupiter  will  consume  the  rest,  when  the  three  inferior  elements&#x2014;purified  by  reabsorption  in <br/>the  fiery  ether &#x2014;will  come  forth  renewed,  constituting  &quot;a  new  heaven  and  a  new  earth.&quot; <br/><br/>When  the  fifth  seal  was  opened  St.  John  beheld  those  who  had  died  for  the  word  of  God.  When  the <br/>sixth  seal  was  broken  there  was  a  great  earthquake,  the  sun  being  darkened  and  the  moon  becoming <br/>like  blood.  The  angels  of  the  winds  came  forth  and  also  another  angel,  who  sealed  upon  their <br/>foreheads  144,000  of  the  children  of  Israel  that  they  should  be  preserved  against  the  awful  day  of <br/>tribulation.  By  adding  the  digits  together  according  to  the  Pythagorean  system  of  numerical <br/>philosophy,  the  number  144,000  is  reduced  to  9,  the  mystic  symbol  of  man  and  also  the  number  of <br/>initiation,  for  he  who  passes  through  the  nine  degrees  of  the  Mysteries  receives  the  sign  of  the  cross  as <br/>emblematic  of  his  regeneration  and  liberation  from  the  bondage  of  his  own  infernal,  or  inferior, <br/>nature.  The  addition  of  the  three  ciphers  to  the  original  sacred  number  1.44  indicates  the  elevation  of <br/>the  mystery  to  the  third  sphere. <br/><br/>When  the  seventh  seal  was  broken  there  was  silence  for  the  space  of  half  an  hour.  Then  came  forth <br/>seven  angels  and  to  each  was  given  a  trumpet.  When  the  seven  angels  sounded  their  trumpets- <br/>intoned  the  seven-lettered  Name  of  the  Logos&#x2014;great  catastrophes  ensued.  A  star,  which  was  called <br/>Wormwood,  fell  from  heaven,  thereby  signifying  that  the  secret  doctrine  of  the  ancients  had  been <br/>given  to  men  who  had  profaned  it  and  caused  the  wisdom  of  God  to  become  a  destructive  agency.  And <br/>another  star&#x2014;symbolizing  the  false  light  of  human  reason  as  distinguished  from  the  divine  reason  of <br/>the  initiate&#x2014; fell  from  heaven  and  to  it  (materialistic  reason)  was  given  the  key  to  the  bottomless  pit <br/>(Nature),  which  it  opened,  causing  all  manner  of  evil  creatures  to  issue  forth.  And  there  came  also  a <br/>mighty  angel  who  was  clothed  in  a  cloud,  whose  face  was  as  the  sun  and  his  feet  and  legs  as  pillars  of <br/>fire,  and  one  foot  was  upon  the  waters  and  the  other  upon  the  land  (the  Hermetic  Anf/iropos).  This <br/>celestial  being  gave  St.  John  a  little  book,  bidding  him  eat  it,  which  the  seer  did.  The  book  is <br/>representative  of  the  secret  doctrine&#x2014; that  spiritual  food  which  is  the  nourishment  of  the  spirit.  And  St. <br/>John,  being  &quot;in  the  spirit,&quot;  ate  his  fill  of  the  wisdom  of  God  and  the  hunger  of  his  soul  was  appeased. <br/><br/>The  twelfth  chapter  treats  of  a  great  wonder  appearing  in  the  heavens:  a  woman  clothed  with  the  sun, <br/>the  moon  under  her  feet,  and  upon  her  head  a  crown  of  twelve  stars.  This  woman  represents  the <br/>constellation  of  Virgo  and  also  the  Egyptian  Isis,  who,  about  to  be  delivered  of  her  son  Horus,  is <br/>attacked  by  Typhon,  the  latter  attempting  to  destroy  the  child  predestined  by  the  gods  to  slay  the <br/><br/><br/>JOHN'S  VISION  OF  THE  NEW  JERUSALEM. <br/><br/><br/>From  Klauber's  Historiae  Biblicae  Veteris  etNovi  Testamenti. <br/><br/>In  the  upper  left-hand  corner  is  shown  the  destruction  of  Babylon,  also  the  angel  which  cast  the  great <br/>millstone  into  the  sea,  saying,  &quot;Thus  with  violence  shall  that  great  city  Babylon  be  thrown  down  and <br/>shall  be  found  no  more  at  all.&quot;  Below  is  the  horseman,  called  Faithful  and  True,  casting  the  beast  into <br/>the  bottomless  pit.  At  the  lower  right  is  the  angel  with  the  key  to  the  bottomless  pit,  who  with  a  great <br/>chain  binds  Satan  for  a  thousand  years.  In  the  heavens  above  is  represented  one  like  unto  the  Son  of <br/>Man,  who  carries  a  great  sickle  with  which  he  reaps  the  harvest  of  the  world.  In  the  center  is  the  Holy <br/>City,  the  New  Jerusalem,  with  its  twelve  gates  and  the  mountain  of  the  Lamb  rising  in  the  midst <br/>thereof.  From  the  throne  of  the  Lamb  pours  the  great  river  of  crystal,  or  living  water,  signifying  the <br/>spiritual  doctrine:  upon  all  who  discover  and  drink  of  its  waters  are  conferred  immortality.  Kneeling <br/>upon  a  high  cliff,  St.  John  gazes  down  upon  the  mystic  city,  the  archetype  of  the  perfect  civilization <br/>yet  to  be.  Above  the  New  Jerusalem,  in  a  great  sunburst  of  glory,  is  the  throne  of  the  Ancient  One, <br/>which  is  the  light  of  those  who  dwell  in  the  matchless  empire  of  the  spirit.  Beyond  the  recognition  of <br/>the  uninitiated  world  is  an  ever-increasing  aggregation  composed  of  the  spiritual  elect.  Though  they <br/>walk  the  earth  as  ordinary  mortals,  they  are  of  a  world  apart  and  through  their  ceaseless  efforts  the <br/>kingdom  of  God  is  being  slowly  but  surely  established  upon  earth.  These  illumined  souls  are  the <br/>builders  of  the  New  Jerusalem,  and  their  bodies  are  the  living  stones  in  its  walls.  Lighted  by  the  torch <br/>of  truth  they  carry  on  their  work,  through  their  activities  the  golden  age  will  return  to  the  earth  and <br/>the  power  of  sin  and  death  will  be  destroyed.  For  this  reason  the  declare  that  virtuous  and  illumined <br/>men,  instead  of  ascending  to  heaven,  will  bring  heaven  down  and  establish  it  in  the  midst  of  earth <br/>itself. <br/><br/>p.  188 <br/><br/>Spirit  of  Evil.  The  war  in  heaven  relates  to  the  destruction  of  the  planet  Ragnarok  and  to  the  fall  of  the <br/>angels.  The  virgin  can  be  interpreted  to  signify  the  secret  doctrine  itself  and  her  son  the  initiate  born <br/>out  of  the  &quot;womb  of  the  Mysteries.&quot;  The  Spirit  of  Evil  thus  personified  in  the  great  dragon  attempted <br/>to  control  mankind  by  destroying  the  mother  of  those  illumined  souls  who  have  labored  unceasingly <br/>for  the  salvation  of  the  world.  Wings  were  given  to  the  Mysteries  (the  virgin)  and  they  flew  into  the <br/>wilderness;  and  the  evil  dragon  tried  to  destroy  them  with  a  flood  (of  false  doctrine)  but  the  earth <br/>(oblivion)  swallowed  up  the  false  doctrines  and  the  Mysteries  endured. <br/><br/>The  thirteenth  chapter  describes  a  great  beast  which  rose  out  of  the  sea,  having  seven  heads  and  ten <br/>horns.  Faber  sees  in  this  amphibious  monster  the  Demiurgus,  or  Creator  of  the  world,  rising  out  of <br/>the  Ocean  of  Chaos.  While  most  interpreters  of  the  Apocalypse  consider  the  various  beasts  described <br/>therein  as  typical  of  evil  agencies,  this  viewpoint  is  the  inevitable  result  of  unfamiliarity  with  the <br/>ancient  doctrines  from  which  the  symbolism  of  the  book  is  derived.  Astronomically,  the  great  monster <br/>rising  out  of  the  sea  is  the  constellation  of  Cetus  (the  whale).  Because  religious  ascetics  looked  upon <br/><br/><br/>the  universe  itself  as  an  evil  and  ensnaring  fabrication,  they  also  came  to  regard  its  very  Creator  as  a <br/>weaver  of  delusions.  Thus  the  great  sea  monster  (the  world)  and  its  Maker  (the  Demiurgus),  whose <br/>strength  is  derived  from  the  Dragon  of  Cosmic  Power,  came  to  be  personified  as  a  beast  of  horror  and <br/>destruction,  seeking  to  swallow  up  the  immortal  part:  of  human  nature.  The  seven  heads  of  the <br/>monster  represent  the  seven  stars  (spirits)  composing  the  constellation  of  the  Great  Dipper,  called  by <br/>the  Hindus  Rishis,  or  Cosmic  Creative  Spirits.  The  ten  horns  Faber  relates  to  the  ten  primordial <br/>patriarchs.  These  may  also  denote  the  ancient  zodiac  of  ten  signs. <br/><br/>The  number  of  the  beast  (666)  is  an  interesting  example  of  the  use  of  Qabbalism  in  the  New <br/>Testament  and  among  early  Christian  mystics.  In  the  following  table  Kircher  shows  that  the  names  of <br/>Antichrist  as  given  by  Iranaeus  all  have  666  as  their  numerical  equivalent. <br/><br/><br/>T <br/><br/>300 <br/><br/>A <br/><br/>30 <br/><br/>A <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>A <br/><br/>30 <br/><br/>8 <br/><br/>5 <br/><br/>a <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>v <br/><br/>50 <br/><br/>a <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>I <br/><br/>lO <br/><br/>^l <br/><br/>40 <br/><br/>T <br/><br/>300 <br/><br/>T <br/><br/>300 <br/><br/>T <br/><br/>300 <br/><br/>n <br/><br/>80 <br/><br/>8 <br/><br/>5 <br/><br/>8 <br/><br/>5 <br/><br/>a <br/><br/>1 <br/><br/>e <br/><br/>5 <br/><br/>1^ <br/><br/>40 <br/><br/>I <br/><br/>10 <br/><br/>v <br/><br/>50 <br/><br/>T <br/><br/>300 <br/><br/>0 <br/><br/>70 <br/><br/>v <br/><br/>50 <br/><br/>I <br/><br/>10 <br/><br/>? <br/><br/>200 <br/><br/>0 <br/><br/>70 <br/><br/>? <br/><br/>200 <br/><br/>? <br/><br/>200 <br/><br/>666 <br/><br/>666 <br/><br/>666 <br/><br/>666 <br/><br/>James  Morgan  Pryse  also  notes  that  according  to  this  method  of  figuring,  the  Greek  term  r\  (ppr\v, <br/>which  signifies  the  lower  mind,  has  666  as  its  numerical  equivalent.  It  is  also  well  known  to <br/>Qabbalists  that  Irjooug,  Jesus,  has  for  its  numerical  value  another  sacred  and  secret  number~888. <br/>Adding  the  digits  of  the  number  666  and  again  adding  the  digits  of  the  sum  gives  the  sacred  number&#x2014; <br/>9  the  symbol  of  man  in  his  unregenerate  state  and  also  the  path  of  his  resurrection. <br/><br/>The  fourteenth  chapter  opens  with  the  Lamb  standing  on  Mount  Zion  (the  eastern  horizon),  about <br/>Him  gathered  the  144,000  with  the  name  of  God  written  in  their  foreheads.  An  angel  thereupon <br/>announces  the  fall  of  Babylon&#x2014;the  city  of  confusion  or  worldliness.  Those  perish  who  do  not <br/>overcome  worldliness  and  enter  into  the  realization  that  spirit&#x2014;and  not  matter&#x2014; is  enduring;  for, <br/>having  no  interests  other  than  those  which  are  material,  they  are  swept  to  destruction  with  the <br/>material  world.  And  St.  John  beheld  One  like  unto  the  Son  of  Man  (Perseus)  riding  upon  a  cloud  (the <br/>substances  of  the  invisible  world)  and  bearing  in  his  hand  a  sharp  sickle,  and  with  the  sickle  the <br/>Shining  One  reaped  the  earth.  This  is  a  symbol  of  the  Initiator  releasing  into  the  sphere  of  reality  the <br/>higher  natures  of  those  who,  symbolized  by  ripened  grain,  have  reached  the  point  of  liberation.  And <br/>there  came  another  angel  (Bootes)&#x2014; Death&#x2014; also  with  a  sickle  (Karma),  who  reaped  the  vines  of  the <br/>earth  (those  who  have  lived  by  the  false  light)  and  cast  them  into  the  winepress  of  the  wrath  of  God <br/>(the  purgatorial  spheres). <br/><br/>The  fifteenth  to  eighteenth  chapters  inclusive  contain  an  account  of  seven  angels  (the  Pleiades)  who <br/>pour  their  vials  upon  the  earth.  The  contents  of  their  vials  (the  loosened  energy  of  the  Cosmic  Bull) <br/>are  called  the  seven  last  plagues.  Here  also  is  introduced  a  symbolic  figure,  termed  &quot;the  harlot  of <br/>Babylon,  &quot;which  is  described  as  a  woman  seated  upon  a  scarlet-colored  beast  having  seven  heads  and <br/>ten  horns.  The  woman  was  arrayed  in  purple  and  scarlet  and  bedecked  with  gold,  precious  stones, <br/>and  pearls,  having  in  her  hand  a  golden  cup  full  of  abominations.  This  figure  maybe  an  effort <br/>(probably  interpolated)  to  vilify  Cybele,  or  Artemis,  the  Great  Mother  goddess  of  antiquity.  Because <br/>the  pagans  venerated  the  Mater  Deorum  through  symbols  appropriate  to  the  feminine  generative <br/><br/><br/>principle  they  were  accused  by  the  early  Christians  of  worshiping  a  courtesan.  As  nearly  all  the <br/>ancient  Mysteries  included  a  test  of  the  neophjlie's  moral  character,  the  temptress  (the  animal  soul)  is <br/>here  portrayed  as  a  pagan  goddess. <br/><br/>In  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  chapters  is  set  forth  the  preparation  of  that  mystical  sacrament  called <br/>the  marriage  of  the  Lamb.  The  bride  is  the  soul  of  the  neophyte,  which  attains  conscious  immortality <br/>by  uniting  itself  to  its  own  spiritual  source.  The  heavens  opened  once  more  and  St.  John  saw  a  white <br/>horse,  and  the  rider  (the  illumined  mind)  which  sat  upon  it  was  called  Faithful  and  True.  Out  of  his <br/>mouth  issued  a  sharp  sword  and  the  armies  of  heaven  followed  after  him.  Upon  the  plains  of  heaven <br/>was  fought  the  mystic  Armageddon&#x2014;the  last  great  war  between  light  and  darkness.  The  forces  of  evil <br/>under  the  Persian  Ahriman  battled  against  the  forces  of  good  under  Ahura-Mazda.  Evil  was <br/>vanquished  and  the  beast  and  the  false  prophet  cast  into  a  lake  of  fiery  brimstone.  Satan  was  bound <br/>for  a  thousand  years.  Then  followed  the  last  judgment;  the  books  were  opened,  including  the  book  of <br/>life.  The  dead  were  judged  according  to  their  works  and  those  whose  names  were  not  in  the  book  of <br/>life  were  cast  into  a  sea  of  fire.  To  the  neophyte,  Armageddon  represents  the  last  struggle  between  the <br/>flesh  and  the  spirit  when,  finally  overcoming  the  world,  the  illumined  soul  rises  to  union  with  its <br/>spiritual  Self.  The  judgment  signifies  the  weighing  of  the  soul  and  was  borrowed  from  the  Mysteries <br/>of  Osiris.  The  rising  of  the  dead  from  their  graves  and  from  the  sea  of  illusion  represents  the <br/>consummation  of  the  process  of  human  regeneration.  The  sea  of  fire  into  which  those  are  cast  who <br/>fail  in  the  ordeal  of  initiation  signifies  the  fiery  sphere  of  the  animal  world. <br/><br/>In  the  twenty-first  and  twenty-second  chapters  are  pictured  the  new  heaven  and  the  new  earth  to  be <br/>established  at  the  close  of  Ahriman's  reign.  St.  John,  carried  in  the  spirit  to  a  great  and  high  mountain <br/>(the  brain),  beheld  the  New  Jerusalem  descending  as  a  bride  adorned  for  her  husband.  The  Holy  City <br/>represents  the  regenerated  and  perfected  world,  the  trued  ashlar  of  the  Mason,  for  the  city  was  a <br/>perfect  cube,  it  being  written,  &quot;the  length  and  the  breadth  and  the  height  of  it  are  equal.&quot;  The <br/>foundation  of  the  Holy  City  consisted  of  a  hundred  and  forty-four  stones  in  twelve  rows,  from  which  it <br/>is  evident  that  the  New  Jerusalem  represents  the  microcosm,  patterned  after  the  greater  universe  in <br/>which  it:  stands.  The  twelve  gates  of  this  symbolic  dodecahedron  are  the  signs  of  the  zodiac  through <br/>which  the  celestial  impulses  descend  into  the  inferior  world;  the  jewels  are  the  precious  stones  of  the <br/>zodiacal  signs;  and  the  transparent  golden  streets  are  the  streams  of  spiritual  light  along  which  the <br/>initiate  passes  on  his  path  towards  the  sun.  There  is  no  material  temple  in  that  city,  for  God  and  the <br/>Lamb  are  the  temple;  and  there  is  neither  sun  nor  moon,  for  God  and  the  Lamb  are  the  light.  The <br/>glorified  and  spiritualized  initiate  is  here  depicted  as  a  city.  This  city  will  ultimately  be  united  with  the <br/>spirit  of  God  and  absorbed  into  the  Divine  Efftilgency. <br/><br/>And  St.  John  beheld  a  river,  the  Water  of  Life,  which  proceeded  out  of  the  throne  of  the  Lamb.  The <br/>river  represents  the  stream  pouring  from  the  First  Logos,  which  is  the  life  of  all  things  and  the  active <br/>cause  of  all  creation.  There  also  was  the  Tree  of  Life  (the  spirit)  bearing  twelve  manner  of  fruit,  whose <br/>leaves  were  for  the  healing  of  the  nations.  By  the  tree  is  also  represented  the  year,  which  every  month <br/>yields  some  good  for  the  maintenance  of  existing  creatures.  Jesus  then  tells  St.  John  that  He  is  the <br/>root  and  the  offspring  of  David  and  the  bright  and  morning  star  (Venus).  St.  John  concludes  with  the <br/>words,  &quot;The  grace  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  be  with  you  all.  Amen.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>THE  FOUR  HORSEMEN  OF  THE  APOCALYPSE. <br/><br/><br/>From  Solis' Biblische  Figuren. <br/><br/>In  the  allegory  of  the  four  horsemen&#x2014;according  to  the  mysteries  of  philosophy&#x2014;is  set  forth  the  condition  of  man  during <br/>the  stages  of  his  existence.  In  his  first  and  spiritual  state  he  is  crowed.  As  he  descend  into  the  realm  of  experience  he <br/>carries  the  sword.  Reaching  physical  expression&#x2014; which  is  his  least  spiritual  state&#x2014; he  carries  the  scales,  and  by  the <br/>&quot;philosophic  death&quot;  is  released  again  into  the  highest  spheres.  In  the  ancient  Roman  games  the  chariot  of  the  sun  was <br/>drawn  by  four  horses  of  different  colors  and  the  horsemen  of  the  Apocalypse  may  be  interpreted  to  represent  the  solar <br/>energy  riding  upon  the  four  elements  which  serve  as  media  for  its  expression. <br/><br/><br/>p.  189 <br/><br/>The  Faith  of  Islam <br/><br/>REPRESENTATIVE  of  the  attitude  of  Christendom  toward  Islam,  tih  recent  years  at  least,  is <br/>Alexander  Ross's  postscript  to  the  Anglicized  version,  published  in  1649,  of  Sieur  Du  Ryer's  French <br/>translation  of  the  Koran.  The  author  of  the  postscript  directs  the  following  invective  against <br/>Mohammed  and  the  Koran: <br/><br/>&quot;Good  Reader,  the  great  Arabian  Impostor  now  at  last  after  a  thousand  years,  is  by  the  way  of  France <br/>arrived  in  England,  and  his  Alcoran,  or  gallimaufry  of  errors,  (a  brat  as  deformed  as  the  parent,  and <br/>as  full  of  heresies  as  his  scald  head  was  of  scurvy)  hath  learned  to  speak  English.  *  *  *  If  you  will  take <br/>a  brief  view  of  the  Alcoran,  you  shall  find  it  a  hodgepodge  made  up  of  these  four  ingredients:  1.  Of <br/>Contradictions.  2.  Of  Blasphemy.  3.  Of  ridiculous  Fables.  4.  Of  Lies.&quot; <br/><br/>The  accusation  of  blasphemy  is  emphasized  against  Mohammed  because  he  affirmed  that  God,  being <br/>unmarried,  was  incapable  of  having  a  Son!  The  fallacious  argument,  however,  is  apparent  from  the <br/>Prophet's  own  views  of  the  nature  of  God  as  contained  in  the  second  sura  of  the  Koran: <br/><br/>&quot;To  Allah  [God]  belongeth  the  east  and  the  west;  therefore,  whithersoever  ye  turn  yourselves  to  pray, <br/>there  is  the  face  of  Allah;  for  Allah  is  omnipresent  and  omniscient.  They  say,  Allah  hath  begotten <br/>children:  Allah  forbid!  To  him  belongeth  whatever  is  in  heaven,  and  on  earth;  all  is  possessed  by  him, <br/>the  Creator  of  heaven  and  earth;  and  when  he  decreeth  a  thing,  he  only  saith  unto  it.  Be,  and  it  is.&quot;  In <br/>other  words,  the  God  of  Islam  has  but  to  desire  and  the  object  of  that  desire  at  once  comes  into  being, <br/>whereas  the  God  of  Alexander  Ross  must  proceed  in  accord  with  the  laws  of  human  generation! <br/><br/>Mohammed,  Prophet  of  Islam,  &quot;the  desired  of  all  nations,&quot;  was  born  in  Mecca,  A.D.  570  (?)  and  died <br/>in  Medina,  A.D.  632,  or  in  the  eleventh  ),ear  after  the  Hegira.  Washington  Irving  thus  describes  the <br/>signs  and  wonders  accompanying  the  birth  of  the  Prophet: <br/><br/>&quot;His  mother  suffered  none  of  the  pangs  of  travail.  At  the  moment  of  his  coming  into  the  world  a <br/>celestial  light  illumined  the  surrounding  country,  and  the  new  born  child,  raising  his  eyes  to  heaven, <br/>exclaimed:  'God  is  great!  There  is  no  God  bur  God,  and  I  am  his  prophet!'  Heaven  and  earth,  we  are <br/>assured,  were  agitated  at  his  advent.  The  Lake  Sawa  shrank  back  to  its  secret  springs,  leaving  its <br/>borders  dry;  while  the  Tigris,  bursting  its  bounds,  overflowed  the  neighboring  lands.  The  palace  of <br/>Khosru  the  king  of  Persia  shook  t  on  its  foundations,  and  several  of  its  towers  were  toppled  to  the <br/>earth.  *  *  *  In  the  same  eventful  night  the  sacred  fire  of  Zoroaster,  which,  guarded  by  the  Magi,  had <br/>burned  without  interruption  for  upward  of  a  thousand  years,  was  suddenly  extinguished,  and  all  the <br/>idols  in  the  world  fell  down.&quot;  (See  Mahomet  and  His  Successors.) <br/><br/>While  the  Prophet  was  still  but  a  toddling  babe,  the  Angel  Gabriel  with  seventy  wings  came  to  him, <br/>and  cutting  open  the  child,  withdrew  the  heart.  This  Gabriel  cleansed  of  the  black  drop  of  original  sin <br/>which  is  in  every  human  heart  because  of  the  perfidy  of  Adam  and  then  returned  the  organ  to  its <br/>proper  place  in  the  Prophet's  body.  (See  footnote  in  E.  H.  Palmer's  translation  of  the  Qur'an.) <br/><br/>In  his  youth  Mohammed  traveled  with  the  Meccan  caravans,  on  one  occasion  acted  as  armor-bearer <br/>for  his  uncle,  and  spent  a  considerable  time  among  the  Bedouins,  from  whom  he  learned  many  of  the <br/>religious  and  philosophic  traditions  of  ancient  Arabia.  While  traveling  with  his  uncle,  Abu  Taleb, <br/>Mohammed  contacted  the  Nestorian  Christians,  having  encamped  on  a  certain  night  near  one  of  their <br/>monasteries.  Here  the  young  Prophet-to-be  secured  much  of  his  information  concerning  the  origin <br/>and  doctrines  of  the  Christian  faith. <br/><br/><br/>With  the  passing  years  Mohammed  attained  marked  success  in  business  and  when  about  twenty-six <br/><br/>years  old  married  one  of  his  employers,  a  wealthy  widow  nearly  fifteen  years  his  senior.  The  widow, <br/>Khadijah  by  name,  was  apparently  somewhat  mercenary,  for,  finding  her  young  business  manager <br/>most  efficient,  she  resolved  to  retain  him  in  that  capacity  for  life!  Khadijah  was  a  woman  of <br/>exceptional  mentality  and  to  her  integrity  and  devotion  must  be  ascribed  the  early  success  of  the <br/>Islamic  cause.  By  his  marriage  Mohammed  was  elevated  from  a  position  of  comparative  poverty  to <br/>one  of  great  wealth  and  power,  and  so  exemplary  was  his  conduct  that  he  became  known  throughout <br/>Mecca  as  &quot;the  faithful  and  true.&quot; <br/><br/>Mohammed  would  have  lived  and  died  an  honored  and  respected  Meccan  had  he  not  unhesitatingly <br/>sacrificed  both  his  wealth  and  social  position  in  the  service  of  the  God  whose  voice  he  heard  while <br/>meditating  in  the  cavern  on  Mount  Hira  in  the  month  of  Ramadan.  Year  after  year  Mohammed <br/>climbed  the  rocky  and  desolate  slopes  of  Mount  Hira  (since  called  Jebel  Nur,  &quot;the  Mountain  of  light&quot;) <br/>and  here  in  his  loneliness  cried  out  to  God  to  reveal  anew  the  pure  religion  of  Adam,  that  spiritual <br/>doctrine  lost  to  mankind  through  the  dissensions  of  religious  factions.  Khadijah,  solicitous  over  her <br/>husband's  ascetic  practices  which  were  impairing  his  physical  health,  sometimes  accompanied  him  in <br/>his  weary  vigil,  and  with  womanly  intuition  sensed  the  travail  of  his  soul.  At  last  one  night  in  his <br/>fortieth  year  as  he  lay  upon  the  floor  of  the  cavern,  enveloped  in  his  cloak,  a  great  light  burst  upon <br/>him.  Overcome  with  a  sense  of  perfect  peace  and  understanding  in  the  blessedness  of  the  celestial <br/>presence,  he  lost  consciousness.  When  he  came  to  himself  again  the  Angel  Gabriel  stood  before  him, <br/>exhibiting  a  silken  shawl  with  mysterious  characters  traced  upon  it.  From  these  characters <br/>Mohammed  gained  the  basic  doctrines  later  embodied  in  the  Koran.  Then  Gabriel  spoke  in  a  clear <br/>and  wonderful  voice,  declaring  Mohammed  to  be  the  Prophet  of  the  living  God. <br/><br/>In  awe  and  trembling,  Mohammed  hastened  to  Khadijah,  fearing  the  vision  to  have  been  inspired  by <br/>the  same  evil  spirits  who  served  the  pagan  magicians  so  greatly  despised  by  him,  Khadijah <br/><br/><br/>MOHAMMED'S  NIGHT  JOURNEY  TO  HEAVEN. <br/><br/><br/>From  D'Ohsson's  Tableau  General  de  I'Empire  Othoman. <br/><br/><br/>In  the  seventeenth  sura  of  the  Koran  it  is  written  that  upon  a  certain  night  Mohammed  was  transported  from  the  temple <br/>at  Mecca  to  that  of  Jerusalem,  but  no  details  are  given  of  the  strange  journey.  In  the  Mishkdteu  'l-Masabih,  Mohammed  is <br/>made  to  describe  his  ascent  through  the  seven  heavens  into  the  icy  presence  of  the  may-veiled  God  and  his  subsequent <br/>return  to  his  own  bed,  all  in  a  single  night.  Mohammed  was  awakened  in  the  night  by  the  Angel  Gabriel,  who,  after <br/>removing  the  Prophet's  heart,  washed  the  cavity  with  Zamzam  water,  and  filled  the  heart  itself  with  faith  and  science.  A <br/>strange  creature,  called  Alborak,  or  the  lightning  bolt,  was  brought  for  the  conveyance  of  the  Prophet.  Alborak  is <br/>described  as  white  animal  of  the  shape  and  size  of  a  mule,  with  the  head  of  a  woman  and  the  tail  of  a  peacock.  According <br/>to  some  versions,  Mohammed  merely  rode  Alborak  to  Jerusalem,  where,  dismounting  upon  Mount  Moriah,  he  caught <br/>hold  of  the  lower  rung  of  a  golden  ladder  lowered  from  heaven  and,  accompanied  by  Gabriel,  ascended  through  the  seven <br/>spheres  separating  he  earth  from  the  inner  surface  of  the  empyrean.  At  the  gate  of  each  sphere  stood  me  of  the  Patriarchs, <br/>whom  Mohammed  saluted  as  he  entered  the  various  planes.  At  the  gate  of  the  first  heaven  stood  Adam;  at  the  gate  of  the <br/>second,  John  and  Jesus  (sisters'  sons);  at  the  third,  Joseph;  at  the  fourth,  Enoch;  at  the  fifth,  Aaron;  at  the  sixth,  Moses; <br/>and  at  the  seventh,  Abraham.  Another  order  of  the  Patriarchs  and  prophets  is  given  which  places  Jesus  at  the  gate  of  the <br/>seventh  heaven,  and  upon  reaching  this  Point  Mohammed  is  said  to  have  requested  Jesus  to  intercede  for  him  before  the <br/>throne  of  God. <br/><br/>p.  190 <br/><br/>assured  him  that  his  own  virtuous  hfe  would  be  his  protection  and  that  he  need  fear  no  evil.  Thus <br/>reassured,  the  Prophet  awaited  further  visitations  from  Gabriel.  When  these  did  not  come,  however, <br/>such  a  despair  filled  his  soul  that  he  attempted  self-destruction,  only  to  be  stopped  in  the  very  act  of <br/>casting  himself  over  a  cliff  by  the  sudden  reappearance  of  Gabriel,  who  again  assured  the  Prophet  that <br/>the  revelations  needed  by  his  people  would  be  given  to  him  as  necessity  arose. <br/><br/>Possibly  as  a  result  of  his  lonely  periods  of  meditation,  Mohammed  seemingly  was  subject  to  ecstatic <br/>swoons.  On  the  occasions  when  the  various  suras  of  the  Koran  were  dictated  he  is  said  to  have  fallen <br/>unconscious,  and,  regardless  of  the  chill  of  the  surrounding  air,  to  have  been  covered  with  beads  of <br/>perspiration.  Often  these  attacks  came  without  warning;  at  other  times  he  would  sit  wrapped  in  a <br/>blanket  to  prevent  a  chill  from  the  copious  perspiration,  and  while  apparently  unconscious  would <br/>dictate  the  various  passages  which  a  small  circle  of  trusted  friends  would  either  commit  to  memory  or <br/>reduce  to  writing.  On  one  occasion  in  later  life  when  Abu  Bekr  referred  to  the  gray  hairs  in  his  beard, <br/>Mohammed,  lifting  the  end  of  his  beard  and  looking  at  it,  declared  its  whiteness  to  be  due  to  the <br/>physical  agony  attendant  upon  his  periods  of  inspiration. <br/><br/>If  the  writings  attributed  to  Mohammed  be  considered  as  merely  the  hallucinations  of  an  epileptic&#x2014; <br/>and  for  that  reason  discounted&#x2014;his  Christian  detractors  should  beware  lest  with  the  doctrines  of  the <br/>Prophet  they  also  undermine  the  very  teachings  which  they  themselves  affirm,  for  many  of  the <br/>disciples,  apostles,  and  saints  of  the  early  church  are  known  to  have  been  subject  to  nervous  disorders. <br/>Mohammed's  first  convert  was  his  own  wife,  Khadijah,  who  was  followed  by  other  members  of  his <br/>immediate  family,  a  circumstance  which  moved  Sir  William  Muir  to  note: <br/><br/>&quot;It  is  strongly  corroborative  of  Mohammed's  sincerity  that  the  earliest  converts  to  Islam  were  not  only <br/>of  upright  character,  but  his  own  bosom  friends  and  people  of  his  household;  who,  intimately <br/>acquainted  with  his  private  life,  could  not  fail  otherwise  to  have  detected  those  discrepancies  which <br/>ever  more  or  less  exist  between  the  professions  of  the  hypocritical  deceiver  abroad  and  his  actions  at: <br/>home.&quot;  (See  The  Life  of  Mohammad.) <br/><br/>Among  the  first  to  accept  the  faith  of  Islam  was  Abu  Bekr,  who  became  Mohammed's  closest  and <br/>most  faithful  friend,  in  fact  his  alter  ego.  Abu  Bekr,  a  man  of  brilliant  attainments,  contributed <br/>materially  to  the  success  of  the  Prophet's  enterprise,  and  in  accord  with  the  express  wish  of  the <br/>Prophet  became  the  leader  of  the  faithful  after  Mohammed's  death.  A'isha,  the  daughter  of  Abu  Bekr, <br/>later  became  the  wife  of  Mohammed,  thus  still  further  cementing  the  bond  of  fraternity  between  the <br/>two  men.  Quietly,  but  industriously,  Mohammed  promulgated  his  doctrines  among  a  small  circle  of <br/>powerful  friends.  When  the  enthusiasm  of  his  followers  finally  forced  his  hand  and  he  publicly <br/>announced  his  mission,  he  was  already  the  leader  of  a  strong  and  well-organized  faction.  Fearing <br/>Mohammed's  growing  prestige,  the  people  of  Mecca,  waiving  the  time-honored  tradition  that  blood <br/><br/><br/>could  not  be  spilt  within  the  holy  city,  decided  to  exterminate  Islam  by  assassinating  the  Prophet.  All <br/>the  different  groups  combined  in  this  undertaking  so  that  the  guilt  for  the  crime  might  thereby  be <br/>more  evenly  distributed.  Discovering  the  danger  in  time,  Mohammed  left  his  friend  Ali  in  his  bed  and <br/>fled  with  Abu  Bekr  from  the  city,  and  after  adroitly  eluding  the  Meccans,  joined  the  main  body  of  his <br/>followers  that  had  preceded  him  to  Yathrib  (afterwards  called  Medina).  Upon  this  incident-called  the <br/>Hegira  or  &quot;flight&quot;~is  based  the  Islamic  chronological  system. <br/><br/>Dating  from  the  Hegira  the  power  of  the  Prophet  steadily  grew  until  in  the  eighth  year  Mohammed <br/>entered  Mecca  after  practically  a  bloodless  victory  and  established  it  as  the  spiritual  center  of  his  faith. <br/>Planting  his  standard  to  the  north  of  Mecca,  he  rode  into  the  city,  and  after  circling  seven  times  the <br/>sacred  Caaba,  ordered  the  360  images  within  its  precincts  to  be  hewn  down.  He  then  entered  the <br/>Caaba  itself,  cleansed  it  of  its  idolatrous  associations,  and  rededicated  the  structure  to  Allah,  the <br/>monotheistic  God  of  Islam.  Mohammed  next  granted  amnesty  to  all  his  enemies  for  their  attempts  to <br/>destroy  him.  Under  his  protection  Mecca  increased  in  power  and  glory,  becoming  the  focal  point  of  a <br/>great  annual  pilgrimage,  which  even  to  this  day  winds  across  the  desert  in  the  months  of  pilgrimage <br/>and  numbers  over  threescore  thousand  in  its  train. <br/><br/>In  the  tenth  year  after  the  Hegira,  Mohammed  led  the  valedictory  pilgrimage  and  for  the  last  time <br/>rode  at  the  head  of  the  faithful  along  the  sacred  way  leading  to  Mecca  and  the  Black  Stone.  As  the <br/>premonition  of  death  was  strong  upon  him,  he  desired  this  pilgrimage  to  be  the  perfect  model  for  all <br/>the  thousands  that  would  follow. <br/><br/>&quot;Conscious  that  life  was  waning  away  within  him,&quot;  writes  Washington  Irving,  &quot;Mahomet,  during  this <br/>last  sojourn  in  the  sacred  city  of  his  faith,  sought  to  engrave  his  doctrines  deeply  in  the  minds  and <br/>hearts  of  his  followers.  For  this  purpose  he  preached  frequently  in  the  Caaba  from  the  pulpit,  or  in  the <br/>open  air  from  the  back  of  his  camel.  'Listen  to  my  words,'  would  he  say,  'for  I  know  not  whether,  after <br/>this  year,  we  shall  ever  meet  here  again.  Oh,  my  hearers,  I  am  but  a  man  like  yourselves;  the  angel  of <br/>death  may  at  any  time  appear,  and  I  must  obey  his  summons.&quot;'  While  thus  preaching,  the  very <br/>heavens  are  said  to  have  opened  and  the  voice  of  God  spoke,  saying:  &quot;This  day  I  have  perfected  your <br/>religion,  and  accomplished  in  you  my  grace.&quot;  When  these  words  were  uttered  the  multitude  fell  down <br/>in  adoration  and  even  Mohammed's  camel  knelt.  (See  Mahomet  and  His  Successors.)  Having <br/>completed  the  valedictory  pilgrimage,  Mohammed  returned  to  Medina. <br/><br/>In  the  seventh  year  after  the  Hegira  (A.H.  7)  an  attempt  was  made  at  Kheibar  to  poison  the  Prophet. <br/>As  Mohammed  took  the  first  mouthful  of  the  poisoned  food,  the  evil  design  was  revealed  to  him <br/>either  by  the  taste  of  the  meat  or,  as  the  faithful  believe,  by  divine  intercession.  He  had  already <br/>swallowed  a  small  portion  of  the  food,  however,  and  for  the  remainder  of  his  life  he  suffered  almost <br/>constantly  from  the  effects  of  the  poison.  In  A.H.  11,  when  his  final  illness  came  upon  him, <br/>Mohammed  insisted  that  the  subtle  effects  of  the  poison  were  the  indirect  cause  of  his  approaching <br/>end.  It  is  related  that  during  his  last  sickness  he  rose  one  night  and  visited  a  burial  ground  on  the <br/>outskirts  of  Medina,  evidently  believing  that  he,  too,  would  soon  be  numbered  with  the  dead.  At  this <br/>time  he  told  an  attendant  that  the  choice  had  been  offered  him  of  continuing  his  physical  life  or  going <br/>to  his  Lord,  and  that  he  had  chosen  to  meet  his  Maker. <br/><br/>Mohammed  suffered  greatly  with  his  head  and  side  and  also  from  fever,  but  on  June  8th  seemed <br/>convalescent.  He  joined  his  followers  in  prayer  and,  seating  himself  in  the  courtyard,  delivered  a <br/>lecture  to  the  faithful  in  a  clear  and  powerful  voice.  Apparently  he  overtaxed  his  strength,  for  it  was <br/>necessary  to  assist  him  into  the  house  of  A'isha,  which  opened  into  the  court  of  the  mosque.  Here <br/>upon  a  tough  pallet  laid  on  the  bare  floor  the  prophet  of  Islam  spent  his  last  two  hours  on  earth. <br/>When  she  saw  that  her  aged  husband  was  suffering  intense  pain,  A'isha&#x2014;then  but  a  girl  of  twenty- <br/>lifting  the  gray  head  of  the  man  she  had  known  from  infancy  and  who  must  have  seemed  more  like  a <br/>father  than  a  husband,  supported  him  in  her  arms  until  the  end.  Feeling  that  death  was  upon  him, <br/>Mohammed  prayed:  &quot;O  Lord,  I  beseech  Thee,  assist  me  in  the  agonies  of  death.&quot;  Then  almost  in  a <br/><br/><br/>whisper  he  repeated  three  times:  &quot;Gabriel,  come  close  unto  me.&quot;  (For  details  consult  The  Life  of <br/>Mohammad  by  Sir  William  Muir.)  In  The  Hero  as  Prophet,  Thomas  Carlyle  writes  thus  of  the  death <br/>of  Mohammed:  &quot;His  last  words  were  a  prayer,  broken  ejaculations  of  a  heart  struggling-up  in <br/>trembling  hope  towards  its  Maker.&quot; <br/><br/>Mohammed  was  buried  under  the  floor  of  the  apartment  in  which  he  died.  The  present  condition  of <br/>the  grave  is  thus  described: <br/><br/>&quot;Above  the  Hujrah  is  a  green  dome,  surmounted  by  a  large  gilt  crescent,  springing  from  a  series  of <br/>globes.  Within  the  building  are  the  tombs  of  Muhammad,  Abu  Bakr,  and  'Umar,  with  a  space  reserved <br/>for  the  grave  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  Muslims  say  will  again  visit  the  earth,  and  die  and  be <br/>buried  at  al-Madinah.  The  grave  of  Fatimah,  the  Prophet's  daughter,  is  supposed  to  be  in  a  separate <br/>part  of  the  building,  although  some  say  she  was  buried  in  Baqi'.  The  Prophet's  body  is  said  to  be <br/>stretched  full  length  on  the  right  side,  with  the  right  palm  supporting  the  right  check,  the  face <br/>fronting  Makkah.  Close  behind  him  is  placed  Abu  Bakr,  whose  face  fronts  Muhammad's  shoulder, <br/>and  then  'Umar,  who  occupies  the  same  position  with  respect  to  his  predecessor.  Amongst  Christian <br/>historians  there  is  a  popular  story  to  the  effect  that  Muhammadans  believed  the  coffin  of  their <br/>Prophet  to  be  suspended  in  the  air,  which  has  no  foundation  whatever  in  Muslim  literature,  and <br/>Niebuhr  thinks  the  story  must  have  arisen  from  the  rude  pictures  sold  to  strangers.  (See  A  Dictionary <br/>of  Islam.) <br/><br/>Concerning  the  character  of  Mohammed  there  have  been  the  grossest  misconceptions.  No  evidence <br/>exists  to  support  the  charges  of  extreme  cruelty  and  licentiousness  laid  at  his  door.  On  the  other  hand, <br/>the  more  closely  the  life  of  Mohammed  is  scrutinized  by  dispassionate  investigators,  the  more <br/>apparent  become  the  finer  qualities  of  his  nature.  In  the  words  of  Carlyle: <br/><br/>&quot;Mahomet  himself,  after  all  that  can  be  said  about  him,  was  nor,  a  sensual  man.  We  so  err  widely  if <br/>we  consider  this  man  as  a  common  voluptuary,  intent  mainly  on  base  enjoyments&#x2014;nay,  on <br/>enjoyments  of  any  kind.  His  household  was  of  the  frugalest,  his  common  diet  barley  bread  and  water. <br/>Sometimes  for  months  there  was  not  a  fire  once  lighted  on  his  hearth.  *  *  *  A  poor,  hard-working,  ill- <br/>provided  man;  careless  of  what  vulgar  man  toiled  for.  *  *  *  They  called  him  a  Prophet,  you  say?  Why, <br/>he  stood  there  face  to  face  with  them;  there,  not  enshrined  in  any  mystery,  visibly  clouting  his  own <br/>cloak,  cobbling  his  own  shoes,  fighting,  counselling,  ordering  in  the  midst  of  them,  they  must  have <br/>seen  what  kind  of  a  man  he  was,  let  him  be  called  what  you  like!  No  emperor  with  his  tiaras  was <br/>obeyed  as  this  man  in  a  cloak  of  his  own  clouting.&quot; <br/><br/>Confused  by  the  apparently  hopeless  task  of  reconciling  the  life  of  the  Prophet  with  the  absurd <br/>statements  long  accepted  as  authentic,  Washington  Irving  weighs  him  in  the  scales  of  fairness. <br/><br/>p.  191 <br/><br/>&quot;His  military  triumphs  awakened  no  pride  nor  vainglory,  as  they  would  have  done  had  they  been <br/>effected  for  selfish  purposes.  In  the  time  of  his  greatest  power,  he  maintained  the  same  simplicity  of <br/>manners  and  appearances  as  in  the  days  of  his  adversity.  *  *  *  It  is  this  perfect  abnegation  of  self, <br/>connected  with  this  apparent  heartfelt  piety,  running  throughout  the  various  phases  of  his  fortune, <br/>which  perplex  one  in  forming  a  just  estimate  of  Mahomet's  character.  *  *  *  When  he  hung  over  the <br/>death-bed  of  his  infant  son  Ibrahim,  resignation  to  the  will  of  God  was  exhibited  in  his  conduct  under <br/>this  keenest  of  afflictions;  and  the  hope  of  soon  rejoining  his  child  in  Paradise  was  his  consolation.&quot; <br/>(See  Mahomet  and  His  Successors.) <br/><br/>A'isha,  questioned  after  the  death  of  the  Prophet  concerning  his  habits,  replied  that  he  mended  his <br/>own  clothes,  cobbled  his  own  shoes,  and  helped  her  in  the  household  duties.  How  far  removed  from <br/>Western  concepts  of  Mohammed's  sanguinary  character  is  A'isha's  simple  admission  that  he  loved <br/><br/><br/>most  of  all  to  sew!  He  also  accepted  the  invitations  of  slaves  and  sat  at  meals  with  servants,  declaring <br/>himself  to  be  a  servant.  Of  all  vices  he  hated  lying  the  most.  Before  his  death  he  freed  all  his  slaves.  He <br/>never  permitted  his  family  to  use  for  personal  ends  any  of  the  alms  or  tithe  money  given  by  his  people. <br/>He  was  fond  of  sweetmeats  and  used  rain  water  for  drinking  purposes.  His  time  he  divided  into  three <br/>parts,  namely:  the  first  he  gave  to  God,  the  second  to  his  family,  and  the  third  to  himself.  The  latter <br/>portion,  however,  he  later  sacrificed  to  the  service  of  his  people.  He  dressed  chiefly  in  white  but  also <br/>wore  red,  yellow,  and  green.  Mohammed  entered  Mecca  wearing  a  black  turban  and <br/><br/>bearing  a  black  standard.  He  wore  only  the  plainest  of  garments,  declaring  that  rich  and  conspicuous <br/>raiment  did  not  become  the  pious,  and  did  not  remove  his  shoes  at  prayer.  He  was  particularly <br/>concerned  with  the  cleanliness  of  his  teeth  and  at  the  time  of  his  death,  when  too  weak  to  speak, <br/>indicated  his  desire  for  a  toothpick.  When  fearful  of  forgetting  something,  the  Prophet  tied  a  thread  to <br/>his  ring.  He  once  had  a  very  fine  gold  ring  but,  noting  that  his  followers  had  taken  to  wearing  similar <br/>rings  in  emulation  of  him,  he  removed  his  own  and  threw  it  away  lest  his  followers  form  an  evil  habit. <br/>(See  The  Life  of  Mohammad.) <br/><br/>The  most  frequent,  and  apparently  the  most  damaging,  accusation  brought  against  Mohammed  is <br/>that  of  polygamy.  Those  who  sincerely  believe  the  harem  to  be  irreconcilable  with  spirituality  should <br/>with  consistency  move  for  the  expurgation  of  the  Psalms  of  David  and  the  Proverbs  of  Solomon  from <br/>the  list  of  inspired  writings,  for  the  harem  of  Islam's  Prophet  was  insignificant  compared  with  that <br/>maintained  by  Israel's  wisest  king  and  the  reputed  favorite  of  the  Most  High!  The  popular  conception <br/>that  Mohammed  taught  that  woman  had  no  soul  and  could  attain  heaven  only  through  marriage  is <br/>not  substantiated  by  the  words  and  attitude  of  the  Prophet  during  his  lifetime.  In  a  paper  entitled  The <br/>Influence  of  Islam  on  Social  Conditions,  read  at  the  World's  Parliament  of  Religions  held  in  Chicago, <br/>in  1893,  Mohammed  Webb  states  the  charge  and  answers  it  thus: <br/><br/>&quot;it  has  been  said  that  Mohammed  and  the  Koran  denied  a  soul  to  woman  and  ranked  her  with  the <br/>animals.  The  Koran  places  her <br/><br/><br/>THE  CAABA,  THE  HOLY  PLACE  OF  ISLAM. <br/><br/><br/>Section  from  panorama  of  Mecca  in  D'Ohsson's  Tableau  General  de  I'Empire  Othman. <br/><br/><br/>The  Caaba,  or  cube-shaped  building  in  the  midst  of  the  great  court  of  the  mosque  at  Mecca,  is  the  most  holy  spot  in  the <br/>Islamic  world.  Toward  it  the  followers  of  the  Prophet  must  face  five  times  a  day  at  the  appointed  hours  of  prayer.  Like  the <br/>devotees  of  nearly  all  other  faiths,  the  Mussulman  originally  faced  the  East  while  in  prayer,  but  by  a  later  decree  he  was <br/>ordered  to  turn  his  face  toward  Mecca. <br/><br/>Little  is  known  of  the  history  of  the  Caaba  prior  to  its  rededication  as  a  Mohammedan  mosque,  other  than  that  the <br/>building  was  a  pagan  temple.  At  the  time  the  Prophet  captured  Mecca,  the  Caaba  and  surrounding  court  contained  360 <br/>idols,  which  were  destroyed  by  Mohammed  before  he  actually  gained  access  to  the  shrine  itself.  The  &quot;Ancient  House,&quot;  as <br/>the  Caaba  is  called,  is  an  irregular  cube  measuring  about  38  feet  in  length,  35  feet  in  height,  and  30  feet  in  width.  The <br/>length  of  each  side  wall  varies  slightly  and  that  of  the  end  walls  over  a  foot.  In  the  southeast  corner  of  the  wall  at  a <br/>convenient  distance  above  the  ground  (about  five  feet)  is  embedded  the  sacred  and  mysterious  black  stone  or  aerolite  of <br/>Abraham.  When  first  given  to  that  patriarch  by  the  Angel  Gabriel  this  stone  was  of  such  strong  whiteness  as  to  be  visible <br/>from  every  part  of  the  earth,  but  late,  it  became  black  because  of  the  sins  of  man.  This  black  stone,  oval  in  shape  and  about <br/>seven  inches  in  diameter,  was  broken  in  the  seventh  century  and  is  now  held  together  by  a  silver  mounting. <br/><br/>According  to  tradition,  2,000  years  before  the  creation  of  the  world  the  Caaba  was  first  constructed  in  heaven,  where  a <br/>model  of  it  still  remains.  Adam  erected  the  Caaba  on  earth  exactly  below  the  spot  in  heaven  occupied  by  the  original,  and <br/>selected  the  stones  from  the  five  sacred  mountains  Sinai,  al-Judi,  Hira,  Olivet,  and  Lebanon.  Ten  thousand  angels  were <br/>appointed  to  guard  the  structure.  At  the  time  of  the  Deluge  the  sacred  house  was  destroyed,  but  afterward  was  rebuilt  by <br/>Abraham  and  his  son  Ishmael.  (For  details  see  A  Dictionary  of  Islam).  It  is  probable  that  the  site  of  the  Caaba  was <br/>originally  occupied  by  a  prehistoric  stone  altar  or  ring  of  uncut  monoliths  similar  to  those  of  Stonehenge.  Like  the  temple <br/>at  Jerusalem,  the  Caaba  has  undergone  many  vicissitudes,  and  the  present  structure  does  not  antedate  the  seventeenth <br/>century  of  the  Christian  Era.  When  Mecca  was  sacked  in  A.D.  930,  the  famous  black  stone  was  captured  by  the <br/>Carmathians,  in  whose  possession  it  remained  over  twenty  years  and  it  is  a  moot  question  whether  the  stone  finally <br/>returned  by  them  in  exchange  far  a  princely  ransom  was  actually  the  original  block  or  a  substitute. <br/><br/>The  side  of  the  Caaba  are  the  supposed  graves  of  Hagar  and  Ishmael,  and  near  the  door  (which  is  about  seven  feet  above <br/>the  ground)  is  the  stone  upon  which  Abraham  stood  while  rebuilding  the  Caaba.  Various  coverings  have  always  been <br/>thrown  over  the  cube-shaped  structure;  the  present  drape,  which  is  replaced  annually,  is  a  black  brocade  embroidered  in  a <br/>gold.  Small  pieces  a  the  old  drape  are  cherished  by  pilgrims  as  holy  relics. <br/><br/>Entrance  to  the  Caaba  is  effected  by  a  movable  flight  of  steps.  The  interior  is  lined  with  varicolored  marble,  silver,  and  gilt. <br/>Although  the  building  is  generally  conceived  to  be  windowless,  this  point  is  disputed.  Access  to  the  roof  is  had  through  a <br/>silver-plated  door.  In  addition  to  the  sacred  books  the  Caaba  contains  thirteen  lamps.  The  great  courtyard  around  the <br/>building  contains  a  number  of  holy  objects,  and  is  bounded  by  a  colonnade  which  originally  consisted  of  360  pillars. <br/>Opening  into  the  courtyard  are  nineteen  gates,  the  sacred  and  significant  number  of  the  Metonic  Cycle  and  also  the <br/>number  of  stones  in  the  inner  ring  of  Stonehenge.  Seven  great  minarets  tower  above  the  Caaba,  and  one  of  the  sacred <br/>ceremonials  in  connection  with  the  building  includes  seven  circumambulations  about  the  central  Caaba  in  an  apparent <br/>effort  to  portray  the  motion  of  the  celestial  bodies. <br/><br/>p.  192 <br/><br/>on  a  perfect  and  complete  equality  with  man,  and  the  Prophet's  teachings  often  place  her  in  a  position <br/>superior  to  the  male  in  some  respects.&quot;  Mr.  Webb  justifies  his  stand  by  quoting  from  the  thirty-fifth <br/>verse  of  the  thirty-third  sura  of  the  Koran: <br/><br/>&quot;Verily  the  Moslems  of  either  sex,  and  the  true  believers  of  either  sex,  and  the  devout  men,  and  the <br/>devout  women,  and  the  men  of  veracity,  and  the  women  of  veracity,  and  the  patient  men,  and  the <br/>patient  women,  and  the  humble  men,  and  the  humble  women,  and  the  alms-givers  of  either  sex,  and <br/>the  men  who  fast,  and  the  women  who  fast,  and  the  chaste  men,  and  the  chaste  women,  and  those  of <br/>either  sex  who  remember  Allah  frequently:  for  them  hath  Allah  prepared  forgiveness  and  a  great <br/>reward.&quot;  Here  the  attainment  of  heaven  is  clearly  set  forth  as  a  problem  whose  only  solution  is  that  of <br/>individual  merit. <br/><br/>On  the  day  of  his  death  Mohammed  told  Fatima,  his  beloved  daughter,  and  Safiya,  his  aunt:  &quot;Work  ye <br/>out  that  which  shall  gain  acceptance  for  you  with  the  Lord:  for  I  verily  have  no  power  with  Him  to <br/>save  you  in  any  wise.&quot;  The  Prophet  did  not  advise  either  woman  to  rely  upon  the  virtues  of  her <br/>husband  nor  in  any  manner  did  he  indicate  woman's  salvation  to  be  dependent  upon  the  human <br/>frailty  of  her  spouse. <br/><br/><br/>Ever^hing  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  Mohammed  is  not  responsible  for  the  contradictions  and <br/><br/>inconsistencies  in  the  Koran,  for  the  volume  was  not  compiled  and  did  not  assume  its  present  form <br/>until  over  twenty  years  after  his  death.  In  its  present  state  the  Koran  is,  for  the  major  part,  a  jumble  of <br/>hearsay  through  which  occasionally  shines  forth  an  example  of  true  inspiration.  From  what  is  known <br/>of  the  man  Mohammed,  it  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  these  nobler  and  finer  portions  represent  the <br/>actual  doctrines  of  the  Prophet;  the  remainder  are  obvious  interpolations,  some  arising  from <br/>misunderstanding  and  others  direct  forgeries  calculated  to  satisfy  the  temporal  ambitions  of <br/>conquering  Islam.  On  this  subject,  Godfrey  Higgins  speaks  with  his  usual  perspicacity: <br/><br/>&quot;Here  we  have  the  Koran  of  Mohammed  and  the  first  four  sincere  and  zealous  patriarchs,  and  the <br/>Koran  of  the  conquering  and  magnificent  Saracens&#x2014;puffed  up  with  pride  and  vanity.  The  Koran  of <br/>the  eclectic  philosopher  was  not  likely  to  suit  the  conquerors  of  Asia.  A  new  one  must  be  grafted  on <br/>the  old,  to  find  a  justification  for  their  enormities.&quot;  (SeeAnacalypsis.) <br/><br/>To  the  discerning  few  it  is  evident  that  Mohammed  had  a  knowledge  of  that  secret  doctrine  which <br/>must  needs  constitute  the  core  of  every  great  philosophical,  religious,  or  ethical  institution.  Through <br/>one  of  four  possible  avenues  Mohammed  may  have  contacted  the  ancient  Mystery  teachings:  (i) <br/>through  direct  contact  with  the  Great  School  in  the  invisible  world;  (2)  through  the  Nestorian <br/>Christian  monks;  (3)  through  the  mysterious  holy  man  who  appeared  and  disappeared  at  frequent <br/>intervals  during  the  period  in  which  the  suras  of  the  Koran  were  revealed;  (4)  through  a  decadent <br/>school  already  existing  in  Arabia,  which  school  in  spite  of  its  lapse  into  idolatry  still  retained  the <br/>secrets  of  the  Ancient  Wisdom  cult.  The  arcana  of  Islam  may  yet  be  demonstrated  to  have  been <br/>directly  founded  upon  the  ancient  pagan  Mysteries  performed  at  the  Caaba  centuries  before  the  birth <br/>of  the  Prophet;  in  fact  it  is  generally  admitted  that  many  of  the  ceremonials  now  embodied  in  the <br/>Islamic  Mysteries  are  survivals  of  pagan  Arabia. <br/><br/>The  feminine  principle  is  repeatedly  emphasized  in  Islamic  symbolism.  For  example,  Friday,  which  is <br/>sacred  to  the  planer  Venus,  is  the  Moslem's  holy  day;  green  is  the  color  of  the  Prophet  and,  being <br/>symbolic  of  verdure,  is  inevitably  associated  with  the  World  Mother;  and  both  the  Islamic  crescent <br/>and  the  scimitar  may  be  interpreted  to  signify  the  crescent  shape  of  either  the  moon  or  Venus. <br/><br/>&quot;The  famous  'Stone  of  Cabar,'  Kaaba,  Cabir,  or  Kebir,  at  Mecca,&quot;  says  Jennings,  &quot;which  is  so  devoutly <br/>kissed  by  the  Faithful,  is  a  Talisman.  It  is  said  that  the  figure  of  Venus  is  seen  to  this  day  engraved <br/>upon  it  with  a  crescent.  This  very  Caaba  itself  was  at  first  an  idolatrous  temple,  where  the  Arabians <br/>worshipped  Al-Uzza  (God  and  Issa),  that  is  Venus.&quot;  (See  Kenealy's  Enoch,  The  Second  Messenger  of <br/>God.) <br/><br/>&quot;The  Mussulmans,&quot;  writes  Sir  William  Jones,  &quot;are  already  a  sort  of  heterodox  Christians:  they  are <br/>Christians,  if  Locke  reasons  justly,  because  they  firmly  believe  the  immaculate  conception,  divine <br/>character,  and  miracles  of  the  MESSIAH;  but  they  are  heterodox,  in  denying  vehemently  his  character <br/>of  Son,  and  his  equality,  as  God,  with  the  Father,  of  whose  unity  and  attributes  they  entertain  and <br/>express  the  most  awful  ideas;  while  they  consider  our  doctrine  as  perfect  blasphemy,  and  insist  that <br/>our  copies  of  the  Scriptures  have  been  corrupted  both  by  Jews  and  Christians.&quot; <br/><br/>The  following  lines  are  declared  by  the  followers  of  the  Prophet  to  have  been  deleted  from  the <br/>Christian  Gospels:  &quot;And  when  Jesus,  the  Son  of  Mary,  said,  O  children  of  Israel,  verily  I  am  the <br/>apostle  of  God  sent  unto  you,  confirming  the  law  which  was  delivered  before  me,  and  bringing  good <br/>tidings  of  an  apostle  who  shall  come  after  me,  and  whose  name  shall  be  AHMED.&quot;  In  the  present  text <br/>containing  the  prophecy  of  Jesus  concerning  a  comforter  to  come  after  Him,  it  is  further  claimed  that <br/>the  word  comforter  should  be  translated  illustrious  and  that  it  had  a  direct  reference  to  Mohammed; <br/>also  that  the  tongues  of  flame  that  descended  upon  the  apostles  on  the  day  of  Pentecost  in  no  way <br/>could  be  interpreted  as  signifying  the  promised  comforter.  When  asked,  however,  for  definite  proof <br/>that  the  original  Gospels  contained  these  so-called  expurgated  references  to  Mohammed,  the <br/><br/><br/>Moslems  make  a  counter-demand  for  production  of  the  original  documents  upon  which  Christianity <br/>is  founded.  Until  such  writings  are  discovered,  the  point  under  dispute  must  remain  a  source  of <br/>controversy. <br/><br/>To  ignore  the  heritage  of  culture  received  from  Islam  would  be  an  unpardonable  oversight,  for  when <br/>the  crescent  triumphed  over  the  cross  in  Southern  Europe  it  was  the  harbinger  of  a  civilization  which <br/>had  no  equal  in  its  day.  In  Studies  in  a  Mosque,  Stanley  Lane-Poole  writes: <br/><br/>&quot;For  nearly  eight  centuries  under  her  Mohammedan  rulers  Spain  set  to  all  Europe  a  shining  example <br/>of  a  civilized  and  enlightened  state.  *  *  *  Art,  literature  and  science  prospered  as  they  then  prospered <br/>nowhere  else  in  Europe.  Students  flocked  from  France  and  Germany  and  England  to  drink  from  the <br/>fountains  of  learning  which  flowed  only  in  the  cities  of  the  Moors.  The  surgeons  and  doctors  of <br/>Andalusia  were  in  the  van  of  science;  women  were  encouraged  to  devote  themselves  to  serious  study, <br/>and  a  lady  doctor  was  not  unknown  among  the  people  of  Cordova.  Mathematics,  astronomy  and <br/>botany,  history,  philosophy  and  jurisprudence,  were  to  he  mastered  in  Spain  and  in  Spain  alone.&quot; <br/><br/>The  Library  of  Original  Sources  thus  sums  up  the  effects  of  Islam: <br/><br/>&quot;The  results  of  Mohammedism  have  been  greatly  underestimated.  In  the  century  after  Mohammed's <br/>death  it  wrested  Asia  Minor,  Africa,  and  Spain  from  Christianity,  more  than  half  of  the  civilized  world, <br/>and  established  a  civilization,  the  highest  in  the  world  during  the  Dark  Ages.  It  brought  the  Arabian <br/>race  to  their  highest  development,  raised  the  position  of  women  in  the  East,  though  it  retained <br/>polygamy,  was  intensively  monotheistic,  and  until  the  Turks  gained  control  for  the  most  part <br/>encouraged  progress.&quot; <br/><br/>In  the  same  work,  among  the  great  Islamic  scientists  and  philosophers  who  have  made  substantial <br/>contributions  to  human  knowledge  are  listed  Gerber,  or  Djafer,  who  in  the  ninth  century  laid  the <br/>foundations  for  modern  chemistry;  Ben  Musa,  who  in  the  tenth  century  introduced  the  theory  of <br/>algebra;  Alhaze,  who  in  the  eleventh  century  made  a  profound  study  of  optics  and  discovered  the <br/>magnifying  power  of  convex  lenses;  and  in  the  eleventh  century  also,  both  Avicenna,  or  Ibn  Sina, <br/>whose  medical  encyclopedia  was  the  standard  of  his  age,  and  the  great  Qabbalist  Avicebron,  or  Ibn <br/>Gebirol. <br/><br/>&quot;Looking  back  upon  the  science  of  the  Mohammedans,&quot;  resumes  the  authority  just  quoted,  &quot;it  will  be <br/>seen  that  they  laid  the  first  foundations  of  chemistry,  and  made  important  advances  in  mathematics <br/>and  optics.  Their  discoveries  never  had  the  influence  they  should  have  had  upon  the  course  of <br/>European  civilization,  but  this  was  because  Europe  itself  was  not  enlightened  enough  to  grasp  and <br/>make  use  of  them.  Gerber's  observation  that  oxidized  iron  weighs  heavier  than  before  oxidation  had <br/>to  be  made  over  again.  So  had  some  of  their  work  in  optics,  and  many  of  their  geographical <br/>discoveries.  They  had  rounded  Africa  long  before  Vasco  da  Gama.  The  composition  of  gunpowder <br/>came  into  Northern  Europe  from  them.  We  must  never  forget  that  the  dark  ages  in  Christian  Europe <br/>were  the  bright  ones  of  the  Mohammedan  world.  In  the  field  of  philosophy  the  Arabs  started  by <br/>adopting  the  neo-Platonism  they  found  in  Europe,  and  gradually  working  back  to  Aristotle.&quot; <br/><br/>What  means  the  subtle  mystery  of  the  phoenix  reborn  every  six  hundred  years?  Faintly  from  within <br/>the  sanctuary  of  the  World  Mysteries  is  whispered  the  answer.  Six  hundred  years  before  Christ  the <br/>phoenix  of  wisdom  (Pythagoras?)  spread  its  wings  and  died  upon  the  altar  of  humanity,  consumed  by <br/>the  sacrificial  fire.  In  Nazareth  the  bird  was  again  reborn  from  its  own  ashes,  only  to  die  upon  the  tree <br/>which  had  its  roots  in  Adam's  skull.  In  A.D.  600  appeared  Ahmed  (Mohammed).  Again  the  phoenix <br/>suffered,  this  time  from  the  poison  of  Kheibar,  and  from  its  charred  ashes  rose  to  spread  its  wings <br/>across  the  face  of  Mongolia,  where  in  the  twelfth  century  Genghis  Khan  established  the  rule  of <br/>wisdom.  Circling  the  mighty  desert  of  Gobi,  the  phoenix  again  gave  up  its  form,  which  now  lies  buried <br/>in  a  glass  sarcophagus  under  a  pyramid  bearing  upon  it  the  ineffable  figures  of  the  Mysteries.  After <br/><br/><br/>the  lapse  of  six  hundred  years  from  the  death  of  Genghis  Khan,  did  Napoleon  Bonaparte&#x2014;who <br/>believed  himself  to  be  the  man  of  destiny&#x2014;contact  in  his  wanderings  this  strange  legend  of  the <br/>continual  periodic  rebirth  of  wisdom?  Did  he  feel  the  spreading  wings  of  the  phoenix  within  himself <br/>and  did  he  believe  the  hope  of  the  world  had  taken  flesh  in  him?  The  eagle  on  his  standard  may  well <br/>have  been  the  phoenix.  This  would  explain  why  he  was  moved  to  believe  himself  predestined  to <br/>establish  the  kingdom  of  Christ  on  earth  and  is,  perhaps,  the  clue  to  his  little-understood  friendliness <br/>toward  the  Moslem. <br/><br/><br/>P193 <br/><br/><br/>American  Indian  Symbolism <br/><br/>THE  North  American  Indian  is  by  nature  a  symbolist,  a  mystic,  and  a  philosopher.  Like  most: <br/>aboriginal  peoples,  his  soul  was  en  rapport  with  the  cosmic  agencies  manifesting  about  him.  Not  only <br/>did  his  Manidos  control  creation  from  their  exalted  seats  above  the  clouds,  but  they  also  descended <br/>into  the  world  of  men  and  mingled  with  their  red  children.  The  gray  clouds  hanging  over  the  horizon <br/>were  the  smoke  from  the  calumets  of  the  gods,  who  could  build  fires  of  petrified  wood  and  use  a <br/>comet  for  a  flame.  The  American  Indian  peopled  the  forests,  rivers,  and  sky  with  myriads  of <br/>superphysical  and  invisible  beings.  There  are  legends  of  entire  tribes  of  Indians  who  lived  in  lake <br/>bottoms;  of  races  who  were  never  seen  in  the  daytime  but  who,  coming  forth  from  their  hidden  caves, <br/>roamed  the  earth  at  night  and  waylaid  unwary  travelers;  also  of  Bat  Indians,  with  human  bodies  and <br/>batlike  wings,  who  lived  in  gloomy  forests  and  inaccessible  cliffs  and  who  slept  hanging  head <br/>downward  from  great  branches  and  outcroppings  of  rock.  The  red  man's  philosophy  of  elemental <br/>creatures  is  apparently  the  outcome  of  his  intimate  contact  with  Nature,  whose  inexplicable  wonders <br/>become  the  generating  cause  of  such  metaphysical  speculations. <br/><br/>In  common  with  the  early  Scandinavians,  the  Indians  of  North  America  considered  the  earth  (the <br/>Great  Mother)  to  be  an  intermediate  plane,  bounded  above  by  a  heavenly  sphere  (the  dwelling  place <br/>of  the  Great  Spirit)  and  below  by  a  dark  and  terrifying  subterranean  world  (the  abode  of  shadows  and <br/>of  submundane  powers).  Like  the  Chaldeans,  they  divided  the  interval  between  the  surface  of  earth <br/>and  heaven  into  various  strata,  one  consisting  of  clouds,  another  of  the  paths  of  the  heavenly  bodies, <br/>and  so  on.  The  underworld  was  similarly  divided  and  like  the  Greek  system  represented  to  the <br/>initiated  the  House  of  the  Lesser  Mysteries.  Those  creatures  capable  of  functioning  in  two  or  more <br/>elements  were  considered  as  messengers  between  the  spirits  of  these  various  planes.  The  abode  of  the <br/>dead  was  presumed  to  be  in  a  distant  place:  in  the  heavens  above,  the  earth  below,  the  distant  comers <br/>of  the  world,  or  across  wide  seas.  Sometimes  a  river  flows  between  the  world  of  the  dead  and  that  of <br/>the  living,  in  this  respect  paralleling  Egyptian,  Greek,  and  Christian  theology.  To  the  Indian  the <br/>number  four  has  a  peculiar  sanctity,  presumably  because  the  Great  Spirit  created  His  universe  in  a <br/>square  frame.  This  is  suggestive  of  the  veneration  accorded  the  tetrad  by  the  Pythagoreans,  who  held <br/>it  to  be  a  fitting  symbol  of  the  Creator.  The  legendary  narratives  of  the  strange  adventures  of  intrepid <br/>heroes  who  while  in  the  physical  body  penetrated  the  realms  of  the  dead  prove  beyond  question  the <br/>presence  of  Mystery  cults  among  the  North  American  red  men.  Wherever  the  Mysteries  were <br/>established  they  were  recognized  as  the  philosophic  equivalents  of  death,  for  those  passing  through <br/>the  rituals  experienced  all  after-death  conditions  while  still  in  the  physical  body.  At  the <br/>consummation  of  the  ritual  the  initiate  actually  gained  the  ability  to  pass  in  and  out  of  his  physical <br/>body  at  will.  This  is  the  philosophic  foundation  for  the  allegories  of  adventures  in  the  Indian  Shadow <br/>Land,  or  World  of  Ghosts. <br/><br/>&quot;From  coast  to  coast,&quot;  writes  Hartley  Burr  Alexander,  &quot;the  sacred  Calumet  is  the  Indian's  altar,  and  its <br/>smoke  is  the  proper  offering  to  Heaven.&quot;  (See  Mythology  of  All  Paces.)  In  the  Notes  on  the  same  work <br/>is  given  the  following  description  of  the  pipe  ceremony: <br/><br/>&quot;The  master  of  ceremonies,  again  rising  to  his  feet,  filled  and  lighted  the  pipe  of  peace  from  his  own <br/>fire.  Drawing  three  whiffs,  one  after  the  other,  he  blew  the  first  towards  the  zenith,  the  second <br/>towards  the  ground,  and  the  third  towards  the  Sun.  By  the  first  act  he  returned  thanks  to  the  Great <br/>Spirit  for  the  preservation  of  his  life  during  the  past  year,  and  for  being  permitted  to  be  present  at  this <br/>council.  By  the  second,  he  returned  thanks  to  his  Mother,  the  Earth,  for  her  various  productions <br/>which  had  ministered  to  his  sustenance.  And  by  the  third,  he  returned  thanks  to  the  Sun  for  his <br/>never-failing  light,  ever  shining  upon  all.&quot; <br/><br/><br/>It  was  necessary  for  the  Indian  to  secure  the  red  stone  for  his  calumet  from  the  pipestone  quarry <br/>where  in  some  remote  past  the  Great  Spirit  had  come  and,  after  fashioning  with  His  own  hands  a <br/>great  pipe,  had  smoked  it  toward  the  four  corners  of  creation  and  thus  instituted  this  most  sacred <br/>ceremony.  Scores  of  Indian  tribes&#x2014;some  of  them  travehng  thousands  of  miles&#x2014;secured  the  sacred <br/>stone  from  this  single  quarry,  where  the  mandate  of  the  Great  Spirit  had  decreed  that  eternal  peace <br/>should  reign. <br/><br/>The  Indian  does  not  worship  the  sun;  he  rather  regards  this  shining  orb  as  an  appropriate  symbol  of <br/>the  Great  and  Good  Spirit  who  forever  radiates  life  to  his  red  children.  In  Indian  symbolism  the <br/>serpent&#x2014; especially  the  Great  Serpent&#x2014; corroborates  other  evidence  pointing  to  the  presence  of  the <br/>Mysteries  on  the  North  American  Continent.  The  flying  serpent  is  the  Atlantean  token  of  the  initiate; <br/>the  seven-headed  snake  represents  the  seven  great  Atlantean  islands  (the  cities  of  Chibola?)  and  also <br/>the  seven  great  prehistoric  schools  of  esoteric  philosophy.  Moreover,  who  can  doubt  the  presence  of <br/>the  secret  doctrine  in  the  Americas  when  he  gazes  upon  the  great  serpent  mound  in  Adams  County, <br/>Ohio,  where  the  huge  reptile  is  represented  as  disgorging  the  Egg  of  Existence?  Many  American <br/>Indian  tribes  are  reincarnationists,  some  are  transmigrationists.  They  even  called  their  children  by <br/>the  names  supposed  to  have  been  borne  by  them  in  a  former  life.  There  is  an  account  of  an  instance <br/>where  a  parent  by  inadvertence  had  given  his  infant  the  wrong  name,  whereupon  the  babe  cried <br/>incessantly  until  the  mistake  had  been  rectified!  The  belief  in  reincarnation  is  also  prevalent  among <br/>the  Eskimos.  Aged  Eskimos  not  infrequently  kill  themselves  in  order  to  reincarnate  in  the  family  of <br/>some  newly  married  loved  one. <br/><br/>The  American  Indians  recognize  the  difference  between  the  ghost  and  the  actual  soul  of  a  dead  person, <br/>a  knowledge  restricted  to  initiates  of  the  Mysteries.  In  common  with  the  Platonists  they  also <br/>understood  the  principles  of  an  archetypal  sphere  wherein  exist  the <br/><br/><br/>NAVAHO  SAND  PAINTING. <br/><br/><br/>From  an  original  drawing  by  Hasteen  Klah. <br/><br/>The  Navaho  dry  or  sand  paintings  are  made  by  sprinkling  varicolored  ground  pigment  upon  a  base  of  smooth  sand.  The <br/>one  here  reproduced  is  encircled  by  the  rainbow  goddess,  and  portrays  an  episode  from  the  Navaho  cosmogony  m5^h. <br/>According  to  Hasteen  Klah,  the  Navaho  sand  priest  who  designed  this  painting,  the  Navahos  do  not  believe  in  idolatry, <br/>hence  they  make  no  images  of  their  gods,  but  perpetuate  only  the  mental  concept  of  them.  Just  as  the  gods  draw  pictures <br/><br/><br/>upon  the  moving  clouds,  so  the  priests  make  paintings  on  the  sand,  and  when  the  purpose  of  the  drawing  has  been <br/>fulfilled  it  is  effaced  by  a  sweep  of  the  hand.  According  to  this  informant,  the  Zuni,  Hopi,  and  Navaho  nations  had  a <br/>common  genesis;  they  all  came  out  of  the  earth  and  then  separated  into  three  nations. <br/><br/>The  Navahos  first  emerged  about  3,000  years  ago  at  a  point  now  called  La  Platte  Mountain  in  Colorado.  The  four <br/>mountains  sacred  to  the  Navahos  are  La  Platte  Mountain,  Mount  Taylor,  Navaho  Mountain,  and  San  Francisco  Mountain. <br/>While  these  three  nations  were  under  the  earth  four  mountain  ranges  were  below  with  them.  The  eastern  mountains  were <br/>white,  the  southern  blue,  the  western  yellow,  and  the  northern  black.  The  rise  and  fall  of  these  mountains  caused  the <br/>alternation  of  day  and  night.  When  the  white  mountains  rose  it  was  day  under  the  earth;  when  the  yellow  ones  rose, <br/>twilight;  the  black  mountains  brought  night,  and  the  blue,  dawn.  Seven  major  deities  were  recognized  by  the  Navahos,  but <br/>Hasteen  Klah  was  unable  to  say  whether  the  Indians  related  these  deities  to  the  planets.  Bakochiddy,  one  of  these  seven <br/>major  gods,  was  white  in  color  with  light  reddish  hair  and  gray  eyes.  His  father  was  the  sun  ray  and  his  mother  the <br/>daylight.  He  ascended  to  heaven  and  in  some  respects  his  life  parallels  that  of  Christ.  To  avenge  the  kidnapping  of  his <br/>child,  Kahothsode,  a  fish  god,  caused  a  great  flood  to  arise.  To  escape  destruction,  the  Zunis,  Hopis,  and  Navahos <br/>ascended  to  the  surface  of  the  earth. <br/><br/>The  sand  painting  here  reproduced  is  part  of  the  medicine  series  prepared  far  the  healing  of  disease.  In  the  healing <br/>ceremony  the  patient  is  placed  upon  the  drawing,  which  is  made  in  a  consecrated  hogan,  and  all  outsiders  excluded.  The <br/>sacred  swastika  in  the  center  of  the  drawing  is  perhaps  the  most  nearly  universal  of  religious  emblems  and  represents  the <br/>four  corners  of  the  world.  The  two  hunchback  god,  at  the  right  and  left  assume  their  appearance  by  reason  of  the  great <br/>clouds  borne  upon  their  backs.  In  Navaho  religious  art,  male  divinities  are  always  shown  with  circular  heads  and  female <br/>divinities  with  square  heads. <br/><br/>p.  194 <br/><br/>patterns  of  all  forms  manifesting  in  the  earth  plane,  The  theory  of  Group,  or  Elder,  Souls  having <br/>supervision  over  the  animal  species  is  also  shared  by  them.  The  red  man's  belief  in  guardian  spirits <br/>would  have  warmed  the  heart  of  Paracelsus.  When  they  attain  the  importance  of  being  protectors  of <br/>entire  clans  or  tribes,  these  guardians  are  called  totems.  In  some  tribes  impressive  ceremonies  mark <br/>the  occasion  when  the  young  men  are  sent  out  into  the  forest  to  fast  and  pray  and  there  remain  until <br/>their  guardian  spirit  manifests  to  them.  Whatever  creature  appears  thereupon  becomes  their  peculiar <br/>genius,  to  whom  they  appeal  in  time  of  trouble. <br/><br/>The  outstanding  hero  of  North  American  Indian  folklore  is  Hiawatha,  a  name  which,  according  to <br/>Lewis  Spence,  signifies  &quot;he  who  seeks  the  wampum-belt.&quot;  Hiawatha  enjoys  the  distinction  of <br/>anticipating  by  several  centuries  the  late  Woodrow  Wilson's  cherished  dream  of  a  League  of  Nations. <br/>Following  in  the  footsteps  of  Schoolcraft,  Longfellow  confused  the  historical  Hiawatha  of  the  Iroquois <br/>with  Manabozho,  a  mythological  hero  of  the  Algonquins  and  Ojibwas.  Hiawatha,  a  chief  of  the <br/>Iroquois,  after  many  reverses  and  disappointments,  succeeded  in  uniting  the  five  great  nations  of  the <br/>Iroquois  into  the  &quot;League  of  the  Five  Nations.&quot;  The  original  purpose  of  the  league&#x2014;to  abolish  war  by <br/>substituting  councils  of  arbitration&#x2014;was  not  wholly  successful,  but  the  power  of  the  &quot;Silver  Chain&quot; <br/>conferred  upon  the  Iroquois  a  solidarity  attained  by  no  other  confederacy  of  North  American  Indians. <br/>Hiawatha,  however,  met  the  same  opposition  which  has  confronted  every  great  idealist,  irrespective <br/>of  time  or  race.  The  shamans  turned  their  magic  against  him  and,  according  to  one  legend,  created  an <br/>evil  bird  which,  swooping  down  from  heaven,  tore  his  only  daughter  to  pieces  before  his  eyes.  When <br/>Hiawatha,  after  accomplishing  his  mission,  had  sailed  away  in  his  self-propelled  canoe  along  the  path <br/>of  the  sunset,  his  people  realized  the  true  greatness  of  their  benefactor  and  elevated  him  to  the  dignity <br/>of  a  demigod.  In  Longfellow's  Song  of  Hiawatha  the  poet  has  cast  the  great  Indian  statesman  in  a <br/>charming  setting  of  magic  and  enchantment;  yet  through  the  maze  of  symbol  and  allegory  is  ever <br/>faintly  visible  the  figure  of  Hiawatha  the  initiate&#x2014; the  very  personification  of  the  red  man  and  his <br/>philosophy. <br/><br/><br/>THE  POPOLVUH <br/><br/><br/>No  other  sacred  book  sets  forth  so  completely  as  the  Popol  Vuh  the  initiatory  rituals  of  a  great  school <br/>of  mystical  philosophy.  This  volume  alone  is  sufficient  to  establish  incontestably  the  philosophical <br/>excellence  of  the  red  race. <br/><br/>&quot;The  Red  'Children  of  the  Sun,'&quot;  writes  James  Morgan  Pryse,  &quot;do  not  worship  the  One  God.  For  them <br/>that  One  God  is  absolutely  impersonal,  and  all  the  Forces  emanated  from  that  One  God  are  personal. <br/>This  is  the  exact  reverse  of  the  popular  western  conception  of  a  personal  God  and  impersonal  working <br/>forces  in  nature.  Decide  for  yourself  which  of  these  beliefs  is  the  more  philosophical.  These  Children <br/>of  the  Sun  adore  the  Plumed  Serpent,  who  is  the  messenger  of  the  Sun.  He  was  the  God  Quetzalcoatl <br/>in  Mexico,  Gucumatz  in  Quiche;  and  in  Peru  he  was  called  Amaru.  From  the  latter  name  comes  our <br/>word  America.  Amaruca  is,  literally  translated,  'Land  of  the  Plumed  Serpent.'  The  priests  of  this  God <br/>of  Peace,  from  their  chief  centre  in  the  Cordilleras,  once  ruled  both  Americas.  All  the  Red  men  who <br/>have  remained  true  to  the  ancient  religion  are  still  under  their  sway.  One  of  their  strong  centres  was <br/>in  Guatemala,  and  of  their  Order  was  the  author  of  the  book  called  Popol  Vuh.  In  the  Quiche  tongue <br/>Gucumatz  is  the  exact  equivalent  of  Quetzalcoatl  in  the  Nahuatl  language;  quetzal,  the  bird  of <br/>Paradise;  coatl,  serpent&#x2014;'the  Serpent  veiled  in  plumes  of  the  paradise-bird'!&quot; <br/><br/>The  Popol  Vuh  was  discovered  by  Father  Ximinez  in  the  seventeenth  century.  It  was  translated  into <br/>French  by  Brasseur  de  Bourbourg  and  published  in  1861.  The  only  complete  English  translation  is <br/>that  by  Kenneth  Sylvan  Guthrie,  which  ran  through  the  early  files  of  The  Word  magazine  and  which  is <br/>used  as  the  basis  of  this  article.  A  portion  of  the  Popol  Vuh  was  translated  into  English,  with <br/>extremely  valuable  commentaries,  by  James  Morgan  Pryse,  but  unfortunately  his  translation  was <br/>never  completed.  The  second  book  of  the  Popol  Vuh  is  largely  devoted  to  the  initiatory  rituals  of  the <br/>Quiche  nation.  These  ceremonials  are  of  first  importance  to  students  of  Masonic  symbolism  and <br/>mystical  philosophy,  since  they  establish  beyond  doubt  the  existence  of  ancient  and  divinely <br/>instituted  Mystery  schools  on  the  American  Continent. <br/><br/>Lewis  Spence,  in  describing  the  Popol  Vuh,  gives  a  number  of  translations  of  the  title  of  the <br/>manuscript  itself.  Passing  over  the  renditions,  &quot;The  Book  of  the  Mat&quot;  and  &quot;The  Record  of  the <br/>Community,&quot;  he  considers  it  likely  that  the  correct  title  is  &quot;The  Collection  of  Written  Leaves,&quot;  Popol <br/>signifying  the  &quot;prepared  bark&quot;  and  Vuh,  &quot;paper&quot;  or  &quot;book&quot;  from  the  verb  uoch,  to  write.  Dr.  Guthrie <br/>interprets  the  words  Popol  Vuh  to  mean  &quot;The  Senate  Book,&quot;  or  &quot;The  Book  of  the  Holy  Assembly&quot;; <br/>Brasseur  de  Bourbourg  calls  it  &quot;The  Sacred  Book&quot;;  and  Father  Ximinez  designates  the  volume  &quot;The <br/>National  Book.&quot;  In  his  articles  on  the  Popol  Vuh  appearing  in  the  fifteenth  volume  of  Lucifer,  James <br/>Morgan  Pryse,  approaching  the  subject  from  the  standpoint  of  the  mystic,  calls  this  work  &quot;The  Book <br/>of  the  Azure  Veil.&quot;  In  the  Popol  Vuh  itself  the  ancient  records  from  which  the  Christianized  Indian <br/>who  compiled  it  derived  his  material  are  referred  to  as  &quot;The  Tale  of  Human  Existence  in  the  Land  of <br/>Shadows,  and.  How  Man  Saw  Light  and  Life.&quot; <br/><br/>The  meager  available  native  records  contain  abundant  evidence  that  the  later  civilizations  of  Central <br/>and  South  America  were  hopelessly  dominated  by  the  black  arts  of  their  priestcrafts.  In  the <br/>convexities  of  their  magnetized  mirrors  the  Indian  sorcerers  captured  the  intelligences  of  elemental <br/>beings  and,  gazing  into  the  depths  of  these  abominable  devices,  eventually  made  the  scepter <br/>subservient  to  the  wand.  Robed  in  garments  of  sable  hue,  the  neophytes  in  their  search  for  truth  were <br/>led  by  their  sinister  guides  through  the  confused  passageways  of  necromancy.  By  the  left-hand  path <br/>they  descended  into  the  somber  depths  of  the  infernal  world,  where  they  learned  to  endow  stones <br/>with  the  power  of  speech  and  to  subtly  ensnare  the  minds  of  men  with  their  chants  and  fetishes.  As <br/>typical  of  the  perversion  which  prevailed,  none  could  achieve  to  the  greater  Mysteries  until  a  human <br/>being  had  suffered  immolation  at  his  hand  and  the  bleeding  heart  of  the  victim  had  been  elevated <br/>before  the  leering  face  of  the  stone  idol  fabricated  by  a  priestcraft  the  members  of  which  realized <br/>more  fully  than  they  dared  to  admit  the  true  nature  of  the  man-made  demon.  The  sanguinary  and <br/><br/><br/>indescribable  rites  practiced  by  many  of  the  Central  American  Indians  may  represent  remnants  of  the <br/><br/>later  Atlantean  perversion  of  the  ancient  sun  Mysteries.  According  to  the  secret  tradition,  it  was <br/>during  the  later  Atlantean  epoch  that  black  magic  and  sorcery  dominated  the  esoteric  schools, <br/>resulting  in  the  bloody  sacrificial  rites  and  gruesome  idolatry  which  ultimately  overthrew  the <br/>Atlantean  empire  and  even  penetrated  the  Aryan  religious  world. <br/><br/><br/>The  princes  of  Xibalba  (so  the  Popol  Vuh  recounts)  sent  their  four  owl  messengers  to  Hunhun-ahpu <br/>and  Vukub-hunhun-ahpu,  ordering  them  to  come  at  once  to  the  place  of  initiation  in  the  fastnesses  of <br/>the  Guatemalan  mountains.  Failing  in  the  tests  imposed  by  the  princes  of  Xibalba,  the  two  brothers- <br/>according  to  the  ancient  custom&#x2014;paid  with  their  lives  for  their  shortcomings.  Hunhun-ahpu  and <br/>Vukub-hunhun-ahpu  were  buried  together,  but  the  head  of  Hunhun-ahpu  was  placed  among  the <br/>branches  of  the  sacred  calabash  tree  which  grew  in  the  middle  of  the  road  leading  to  the  awful <br/>Mysteries  of  Xibalba.  Immediately  the  calabash  tree  covered  itself  with  fruit  and  the  head  of  Hunhun- <br/>ahpu  &quot;showed  itself  no  more;  for  it  reunited  itself  with  the  other  fruits  of  the  calabash  tree.&quot;  Now <br/>Xquiq  was  the  virgin  daughter  of  prince  Cuchumaquiq.  From  her  father  she  had  learned  of  the <br/>marvelous  calabash  tree,  and  desiring  to  possess  some  of  its  fruit,  she  journeyed  alone  to  the  somber <br/>place  where  it  grew.  When  Xquiq  put  forth  her  hand  to  pick  the  fruit  of  the  tree,  some  saliva  from  the <br/>mouth  of  Hunhun-ahpu  fell  into  it  and  the  head  spoke  to  Xquiq,  saying:  &quot;This  saliva  and  froth  is  my <br/>posterity  which  I  have  just  given  you.  Now  my  head  will  cease  to  speak,  for  it  is  only  the  head  of  a <br/>corpse,  which  has  no  more  flesh.&quot; <br/><br/>Following  the  admonitions  of  Hunhun-ahpu,  the  young  girl  returned  to  her  home.  Her  father, <br/>Cuchumaquiq,  later  discovering  that  she  was  about  to  become  a  mother,  questioned  her  concerning <br/>the  father  of  her  child.  Xquiq  replied  that  the  child  was  begotten  while  she  was  gazing  upon  the  head <br/>of  Hunhun-ahpu  in  the  calabash  tree  and  that  she  had  known  no  man.  Cuchumaquiq,  refusing  to <br/>believe  her  story,  at  the  instigation  of  the  princes  of  Xibalba,  demanded  her  heart  in  an  urn.  Led  away <br/>by  her  executioners,  Xquiq  pleaded  with  them  to  spare  her  life,  which  they  agreed  to  do,  substituting <br/>for  her  heart  the  fruit  of  a  certain  tree  (rubber)  whose  sap  was  red  and  of  the  consistency  of  blood. <br/>When  the  princes  of  Xibalba  placed  the  supposed  heart  upon  the  coals  of  the  altar  to  be  consumed, <br/>they  were  all  amazed  by  the  perfume  which  rose  therefrom,  for  they  did  not  know  that  they  were <br/>burning  the  fruit  of  a  fragrant  plant. <br/><br/>Xquiq  gave  birth  to  twin  sons,  who  were  named  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  and  whose  lives  were <br/>dedicated  to  avenging  the  deaths  of  Hunhun-ahpu  and  Vukub-hunhun-ahpu.  The  years  passed,  and <br/>the  two  boys  grew  up  to  manhood  and  great  were  their  deeds.  Especially  did  they  excel  in  a  certain <br/>game  called  tennis  but  somewhat  resembling  hockey.  Hearing  of  the  prowess  of  the  youths,  the <br/>princes  of  Xibalba  asked:  &quot;Who,  then,  are  those  who  now  begin  again  to  play  over  our  heads,  and  who <br/>do  not  scruple  to  shake  (the  earth)?  Are  not  Hunhun-ahpu  and  Vukub-hunhun-ahpu  dead,  who <br/>wished <br/><br/><br/>THE  MYSTERIES  OF  XIBALBA <br/><br/><br/>FRAGMENT  OF  INDIAN  POTTERY. <br/><br/><br/>Courtesy  of  Alice  Palmer  Henderson <br/><br/><br/>This  curious  fragment  was  found  four  feet  under  the  ground  beneath  a  trash  pile  of  broken  early <br/>Indian  pottery  not  far  from  the  Casa  Grande  ruins  in  Arizona.  It  is  significant  because  of  its  striking  to <br/>the  Masonic  compass  and  square.  Indian  baskets  pottery,  and  blankets  frequently  bear  ornamental <br/>designs  of  especial  Masonic  and  philosophic  interest. <br/><br/>P195 <br/><br/>to  exalt  themselves  before  our  face?&quot;  So  the  princes  of  Xibalba  sent  for  the  two  youths,  Hunahpu  and <br/>Xbalanque,  that  they  might  destroy  them  also  in  the  seven  days  of  the  Mysteries.  Before  departing, <br/>the  two  brothers  bade  farewell  to  their  grandmother,  each  planting  in  the  midst  of  the  house  a  cane <br/>plant,  saying  that  as  long  as  the  cane  lived  she  would  know  that  they  were  alive.  &quot;O,  our  grandmother, <br/>O,  our  mother,  do  not  weep;  behold  the  sign  of  our  word  which  remains  with  you.  &quot;  Hunahpu  and <br/>Xbalanque  then  departed,  each  with  his  sabarcan  (blowpipe),  and  for  many  days  they  journeyed <br/>along  the  perilous  trail,  descending  through  tortuous  ravines  and  along  precipitous  cliffs,  past  strange <br/>birds  and  boiling  springs,  cowards  the  sanctuary  of  Xibalba. <br/><br/>The  actual  ordeals  of  the  Xibalbian  Mysteries  were  seven  in  number.  As  a  preliminary  the  two <br/>adventurers  crossed  a  river  of  mud  and  then  a  stream  of  blood,  accomplishing  these  difficult  feats  by <br/>using  their  sabarcans  as  bridges.  Continuing  on  their  way,  they  reached  a  point  where  four  roads <br/>converged&#x2014;a  black  road,  a  white  road,  a  red  road,  and  a  green  road.  Now  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque <br/>knew  that  their  first  test  would  consist  of  being  able  to  discriminate  between  the  princes  of  Xibalba <br/>and  the  wooden  effigies  robed  to  resemble  them;  also  that  they  must  call  each  of  the  princes  by  his <br/>correct  name  without  having  been  given  the  information.  To  secure  this  information,  Hunahpu  pulled <br/>a  hair  from  his  leg,  which  hair  then  became  a  strange  insect  called  Xan;  buzzing  along  the  black  road, <br/>the  Xan  entered  the  council  chamber  of  the  princes  of  Xibalba  and  stung  the  leg  of  the  figure  nearest <br/>the  door,  which  it  discovered  to  be  a  manikin.  By  the  same  artifice  the  second  figure  was  proved  to  be <br/>of  wood,  but  upon  stinging  the  third,  there  was  an  immediate  response.  By  stinging  each  of  the  twelve <br/>assembled  princes  in  turn  the  insect  thus  discovered  each  one's  name,  for  the  princes  called  each <br/>other  by  name  in  discussing  the  cause  of  the  mysterious  bites.  Having  secured  the  desired <br/>information  in  this  novel  manner,  the  insect  then  flew  back  to  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque,  who  thus <br/>fortified,  fearlessly  approached  the  threshold  of  Xibalba  and  presented  themselves  to  the  twelve <br/>assembled  princes. <br/><br/>When  told  to  adore  the  king,  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  laughed,  for  they  knew  that  the  figure  pointed <br/>out  to  them  was  the  lifeless  manikin.  The  young  adventurers  thereupon  addressed  the  twelve  princes <br/>by  name  thus:  &quot;Hail,  Hun-came;  hail,  Vukub-came;  hail,  Xiquiripat;  hail,  Cuchumaquiq;  hail, <br/>Ahalpuh;  hail,  Ahalcana;  hail,  Chamiabak;  hail,  Chamiaholona;  hail,  Quiqxic;  hail,  Patau;  hail,  Quiqre; <br/>hail,  Quiqrixqaq.&quot;  When  invited  by  the  Xibalbians  to  seat  themselves  upon  a  great  stone  bench, <br/>Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  declined  to  do  so,  declaring  that  they  well  knew  the  stone  to  be  heated  so <br/>that  they  would  he  burned  to  death  if  they  sat  upon  it.  The  princes  of  Xibalba  then  ordered  Hunahpu <br/>and  Xbalanque  to  rest  for  the  night  in  the  House  of  Shadows.  This  completed  the  first  degree  of  the <br/>Xibalbian  Mysteries. <br/><br/>The  second  trial  was  given  in  the  House  of  Shadows,  where  to  each  of  the  candidates  was  brought  a <br/>pine  torch  and  a  cigar,  with  the  injunction  that  both  must  be  kept  alight  throughout  the  entire  night <br/>and  yet  each  must  be  returned  the  next  morning  unconsumed.  Knowing  that  death  was  the <br/>alternative  to  failure  in  the  test,  the  young  men  burnt  aras-feathers  in  place  of  the  pine  splinters <br/>(which  they  closely  resemble)  and  also  put  fireflies  on  the  tips  of  the  cigars.  Seeing  the  lights,  those <br/>who  watched  felt  certain  that  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  had  fallen  into  the  trap,  but  when  morning <br/>came  the  torches  and  cigars  were  returned  to  the  guards  unconsumed  and  still  burning.  In <br/>amazement  and  awe,  the  princes  of  Xibalba  gazed  upon  the  unconsumed  splinters  and  cigars,  for <br/>never  before  had  these  been  returned  intact. <br/><br/><br/>The  third  ordeal  took  place  presumably  in  a  cavern  called  the  House  of  Spears.  Here  hour  after  hour <br/><br/>the  youths  were  forced  to  defend  themselves  against  the  strongest  and  most  skillful  warriors  armed <br/>with  spears.  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  pacified  the  spearmen,  who  thereupon  ceased  attacking  them. <br/>They  then  turned  their  attention  to  the  second  and  most  difficult  part  of  the  test:  the  production  of <br/>four  vases  of  the  rarest  flowers  but  which  they  were  not  permitted  to  leave  the  temple  to  gather. <br/>Unable  to  pass  the  guards,  the  two  young  men  secured  the  assistance  of  the  ants.  These  tiny  creatures, <br/>crawling  into  the  gardens  of  the  temple,  brought  back  the  blossoms  so  that  by  morning  the  vases  were <br/>filled.  When  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  presented  the  flowers  to  the  twelve  princes,  the  latter,  in <br/>amazement,  recognized  the  blossoms  as  having  been  filched  from  their  own  private  gardens.  In <br/>consternation,  the  princes  of  Xibalba  then  counseled  together  how  they  could  destroy  the  intrepid <br/>neophytes  and  forthwith  prepared  for  them  the  next  ordeal. <br/><br/>For  their  fourth  test,  the  two  brothers  were  made  to  enter  the  House  of  Cold,  where  they  remained  for <br/>an  entire  night.  The  princes  of  Xibalba  considered  the  chill  of  the  icy  cavern  to  be  unbearable  and  it  is <br/>described  as  &quot;the  abode  of  the  frozen  winds  of  the  North.&quot;  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque,  however, <br/>protected  themselves  from  the  deadening  influence  of  the  frozen  air  by  building  fires  of  pine  cones, <br/>whose  warmth  caused  the  spirit  of  cold  to  leave  the  cavern  so  that  the  youths  were  not  dead  but  full  of <br/>life  when  day  dawned.  Even  greater  than  before  was  the  amazement  of  the  princes  of  Xibalba  when <br/>Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  again  entered  the  Hall  of  Assembly  in  the  custody  of  their  guardians. <br/><br/>The  fifth  ordeal  was  also  of  a  nocturnal  nature.  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  were  ushered  into  a  great <br/>chamber  which  was  immediately  filled  with  ferocious  tigers.  Here  they  were  forced  to  remain <br/>throughout  the  night.  The  young  men  tossed  bones  to  the  tigers,  which  they  ground  to  pieces  with <br/>their  strong  jaws.  Gazing  into  the  House  of  the  Tigers,  the  princes  of  Xibalba  beheld  the  animals <br/>chewing  the  bones  and  said  one  to  the  other:  &quot;They  have  at  last  learned  (to  know  the  power  of <br/>Xibalba),  and  they  have  given  themselves  up  to  the  beasts. &quot;  But  when  at  dawn  Hunahpu  and <br/>Xbalanque  emerged  from  the  House  of  the  Tigers  unharmed,  the  Xibalbians <br/><br/><br/>MIDEWIWIN  RECORD  ON  BIRCH  BARK. <br/><br/><br/>Courtesy  of  Alice  Palmer  Henderson. <br/><br/>The  birch-bark  roll  is  one  of  the  most  sacred  possessions  of  an  initiate  of  the  Midewiwin,  or  Grand  Medicine  Society,  of <br/>the  Ojibwas.  Concerning  these  rolls,  Colonel  Carrick  Mallery  writes:  &quot;To  persons  acquainted  with  secret  societies,  a  good <br/>comparison  for  the  Midewiwin  charts  would  be  what  is  called  a  trestleboard  of  a  Masonic  order,  which  is  printed  and <br/>published  and  publicly  exposed  without  exhibiting  any  secrets  of  the  order;  yet  it  is  net  only  significant,  but  useful  to  the <br/>esoteric  in  assistance  to  their  memory  as  to  the  details  of  ceremony.&quot;  A  most  complete  and  trustworthy  account  of  the <br/>Midewiwin  is  that  given  by  W.  J.  Hoffman  in  the  Seventh  Annual  Report  of  the  Bureau  of  Ethnology.  He  writes: <br/><br/>The  Midewiwin&#x2014;Society  of  the  Mide  or  Shaman&#x2014;consists  of  an  indefinite  number  of  Mide  of  both  sexes.  The  society  is <br/>graded  into  four  separate  and  distinct  degrees,  although  there  is  a  general  impression  prevailing  even  among  certain <br/>members  that  any  degree  beyond  the  first  is  practically  a  mere  repetition.  The  greater  power  attained  by  one  in  making <br/><br/><br/>advancement  depends  upon  the  fact  of  his  having  submitted  to  'being  shot  at  with  the  medicine  sacks'  in  the  hands  of  the <br/>officiating  priests.  *  *  *  it  has  always  been  customary  for  the  Mide  priests  to  preserve  birch-bark  records,  bearing  deUcate <br/>incised  Unes  to  represent  pictorially  the  ground  plan  of  the  number  of  degrees  to  which  the  owner  is  entitled.  Such  records <br/>or  charts  are  sacred  and  are  never  exposed  to  the  public  view.&quot; <br/><br/>The  two  rectangular  diagrams  represent  two  degrees  of  the  Mide  lodge  and  the  straight  line  through  the  center  the <br/>spiritual  path,  or  &quot;straight  and  narrow  way,&quot;  running  through  the  degrees.  The  lines  running  tangent  to  the  central  Path <br/>signify  temptations,  and  the  faces  at  the  termini  of  the  lines  are  manidos,  or  powerful  spirits.  Writing  of  the  Midewiwin, <br/>Schoolcraft,  the  great  authority  on  the  American  Indian,  says:  &quot;In  the  society  of  the  Midewiwin  the  object  is  to  teach  the <br/>higher  doctrines  of  spiritual  existence,  its  nature  and  mode  of  existence,  and  the  influence  it  exercises  among  men.  It  is  an <br/>association  of  men  who  profess  the  highest  knowledge  known  to  the  tribes.&quot; <br/><br/>According  to  legend,  Manabozho,  the  great  Rabbit,  who  was  a  servant  of  Dzhe  Manido,  the  Good  Spirit,  gazing  down <br/>upon  the  progenitors  of  the  Ojibwas  and  perceiving  them  to  be  without  spiritual  knowledge,  instructed  an  otter  in  the <br/>mysteries  of  Midewiwin.  Manabozho  built  a  Midewigan  and  initiated  the  otter,  shooting  the  sacred  Migis  (a  small  shell, <br/>the  sacred  symbol  of  the  Mide)  into  the  body  of  the  otter.  He  then  conferred  immortality  upon  the  animal,  and  entrusted <br/>to  it  the  secrets  of  the  Grand  Medicine  Society.  The  ceremony  of  initiation  is  preceded  by  sweat  baths  and  consists  chiefly <br/>of  overcoming  the  influences  of  evil  manidos.  The  initiate  is  also  instructed  in  the  art  of  healing  and  (judging  from  Plate <br/>III  of  Mr.  Hoffman's  article)  a  knowledge  of  directionalizing  the  forces  moving  through  the  vital  centers  of  the  human <br/>body.  Though  the  cross  is  an  important  symbol  in  the  Midewiwin  rites,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  Mide  Priests  steadfastly <br/>refused  to  give  up  their  religion  and  be  converted  to  Christianity. <br/><br/>p.  196 <br/><br/>cried:  &quot;Of  what  race  are  those?&quot;  for  they  could  not  understand  how  any  man  could  escape  the  tigers' <br/>fury.  Then  the  princes  of  Xibalba  prepared  for  the  two  brothers  a  new  ordeal. <br/><br/>The  sixth  test  consisted  of  remaining  from  sunset  to  sunrise  in  the  House  of  Fire.  Hunahpu  and <br/>Xbalanque  entered  a  large  apartment  arranged  like  a  furnace.  On  every  side  the  flames  arose  and  the <br/>air  was  stifling;  so  great  was  the  heat  that  those  who  entered  this  chamber  could  survive  only  a  few <br/>moments.  But  at  sunrise  when  the  doors  of  the  furnace  were  opened,  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  came <br/>forth  unscorched  by  the  fury  of  the  flames.  The  princes  of  Xibalba,  perceiving  how  the  two  intrepid <br/>youths  had  survived  every  ordeal  prepared  for  their  destruction,  were  filled  with  fear  lest  all  the <br/>secrets  of  Xibalba  should  fall  into  the  hands  of  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque.  So  they  prepared  the  last <br/>ordeal,  an  ordeal  yet  more  terrible  than  any  which  had  gone  before,  certain  that  the  youths  could  not <br/>withstand  this  crucial  test. <br/><br/>The  seventh  ordeal  took  place  in  the  House  of  the  Bats.  Here  in  a  dark  subterranean  labyrinth  lurked <br/>many  strange  and  odious  creatures  of  destruction.  Huge  bars  fluttered  dismally  through  the  corridors <br/>and  hung  with  folded  wings  from  the  carvings  on  the  walls  and  ceilings.  Here  also  dwelt  Camazotz, <br/>the  God  of  Bats,  a  hideous  monster  with  the  body  of  a  man  and  the  wings  and  head  of  a  bat.  Camazotz <br/>carried  a  great  sword  and,  soaring  through  the  gloom,  decapitated  with  a  single  sweep  of  his  blade <br/>any  unwary  wanderers  seeking  to  find  their  way  through  the  terror-filled  chambers.  Xbalanque <br/>passed  successfully  through  this  horrifying  test,  but  Hunahpu,  caught  off  his  guard,  was  beheaded  by <br/>Camazotz. <br/><br/>Later,  Hunahpu  was  restored  to  life  by  magic,  and  the  two  brothers,  having  thus  foiled  every  attempt <br/>against  their  lives  by  the  Xibalbians,  in  order  to  better  avenge  the  murder  of  Hunhun-ahpu  and <br/>Vukub-hunhun-ahpu,  permitted  themselves  to  be  burned  upon  a  funeral  pyre.  Their  powdered  bones <br/>were  then  cast  into  a  river  and  immediately  became  two  great  man-fishes.  Later  taking  upon <br/>themselves  the  forms  of  aged  wanderers,  they  danced  for  the  Xibalbians  and  wrought  strange <br/>miracles.  Thus  one  would  cut  the  other  to  pieces  and  with  a  single  word  resurrect  him,  or  they  would <br/>burn  houses  by  magic  and  then  instantly  rebuild  them.  The  fame  of  the  two  dancers&#x2014;who  were  in <br/>reality  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque&#x2014;finally  came  to  the  notice  of  the  twelve  princes  of  Xibalba,  who <br/>thereupon  desired  these  two  miracle-workers  to  perform  their  strange  fears  before  them.  After <br/>Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  had  slain  the  dog  of  the  princes  and  restored  it  to  life,  had  burned  the  royal <br/><br/><br/>palace  and  instantly  rebuilt  it,  and  given  other  demonstrations  of  their  magical  powers,  the  monarch <br/>of  the  Xibalbians  asked  the  magicians  to  destroy  him  and  restore  him  also  to  life.  So  Hunahpu  and <br/>Xbalanque  slew  the  princes  of  Xibalba  but  did  not  return  them  to  life,  thereby  avenging  the  murder  of <br/>Hunhun-ahpu  and  Vukub-hunhun-ahpu.  These  heroes  later  ascended  to  heaven,  where  they  became <br/>the  celestial  lights. <br/><br/>KEYS  TO  THE  MYSTERIES  OF  XIBALBA <br/><br/>&quot;Do  not  these  initiations,&quot;  writes  Le  Plongeon,  &quot;vividly  recall  to  mind  what  Henoch  said  he  saw  in  his <br/>visions?  That  blazing  house  of  crystal,  burning  hot  and  icy  cold&#x2014;that  place  where  were  the  bow  of  fire, <br/>the  quiver  of  arrows,  the  sword  of  fire&#x2014;that  other  where  he  had  to  cross  the  babbling  stream,  and  the <br/>river  of  fire-and  those  extremities  of  the  Earth  full  of  all  kinds  of  huge  beasts  and  birds&#x2014; or  the <br/>habitation  where  appeared  one  of  great  glory  sitting  upon  the  orb  of  the  sun&#x2014; and,  lastly,  does  not  the <br/>tamarind  tree  in  the  midst  of  the  earth,  that  he  was  cold  was  the  Tree  of  Knowledge,  find  its  simile  in <br/>the  calabash  tree,  in  the  middle  of  the  road  where  those  of  Xibalba  placed  the  head  of  Hunhun  Ahpu, <br/>after  sacrificing  him  for  having  failed  to  support  the  first  trial  of  the  initiation?  *  *  *  These  were  the <br/>awful  ordeals  that  the  candidates  for  initiation  into  the  sacred  mysteries  had  to  pass  through  in <br/>Xibalba.  Do  they  not  seem  an  exact  counterpart  of  what  happened  in  a  milder  form  at  the  initiation <br/>into  the  Eleusinian  mysteries?  and  also  the  greater  mysteries  of  Egypt,  from  which  these  were  copied? <br/>Does  not  the  recital  of  what  the  candidates  to  the  mysteries  in  Xibalba  were  required  to  know,  before <br/>being  admitted,  *  *  *  recall  to  mind  the  wonderful  similar  feats  said  to  be  performed  by  the  Mahatmas, <br/>the  Brothers  in  India,  and  of  several  of  the  passages  of  the  book  of  Daniel,  who  had  been  initiated  to <br/>the  mysteries  of  the  Chaldeans  or  Magi  which,  according  to  Eubulus,  were  divided  into  three  classes <br/>or  genera,  the  highest  being  the  most  learned?&quot;  (See  Sacred  Mysteries  among  the  Mayas  and  the <br/>Quiches.) <br/><br/>In  his  introductory  notes  to  the  Popol  Vuh,  Dr.  Guthrie  presents  a  number  of  important  parallelisms <br/>between  this  sacred  book  of  the  Quiches  and  the  sacred  writings  of  other  great  civilizations.  In  the <br/>tests  through  which  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  are  forced  to  pass  he  finds  the  following  analogy  with <br/>the  signs  of  the  zodiac  as  employed  in  the  Mysteries  of  the  Egyptians,  Chaldeans,  and  Greeks: <br/><br/>&quot;Aries,  crossing  the  river  of  mud.  Taurus,  crossing  the  river  of  blood.  Gemini,  detecting  the  two <br/>dummy  kings.  Cancer,  the  House  of  Darkness.  Leo,  the  House  of  Spears.  Virgo,  the  House  of  Cold <br/>(the  usual  trip  to  Hell).  Libra,  the  House  of  Tigers  (feline  poise).  Scorpio,  the  House  of  Fire. <br/>Sagittarius,  the  House  of  Bats,  where  the  God  Camazotz  decapitates  one  of  the  heroes.  Capricorn,  the <br/>burning  on  the  scaffold  (the  dual  Phoenix).  Aquarius,  their  ashes  being  scattered  in  a  river.  Pisces, <br/>their  ashes  turning  into  man-fishes,  and  later  back  into  human  form.&quot; <br/><br/>It  would  seem  more  appropriate  to  assign  the  river  of  blood  to  Aries  and  that  of  mud  to  Taurus,  and  it <br/>is  not  at  all  improbable  that  in  the  ancient  form  of  the  legend  the  order  of  the  rivers  was  reversed.  Dr. <br/>Guthrie's  most  astonishing  conclusion  is  his  effort  to  identify  Xibalba  with  the  ancient  continent  of <br/>Atlantis.  He  sees  in  the  twelve  princes  of  Xibalba  the  rulers  of  the  Atlantean  empire,  and  in  the <br/>destruction  of  these  princes  by  the  magic  of  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  an  allegorical  depiction  of  the <br/>tragic  end  of  Atlantis.  To  the  initiated,  however,  it  is  evident  that  Atlantis  is  simply  a  symbolic  figure <br/>in  which  is  set  forth  the  mystery  of  origins. <br/><br/>Concerned  primarily  with  the  problems  of  mystical  anatomy,  Mr.  Pryse  relates  the  various  symbols <br/>described  in  the  Popol  Vuh  to  the  occult  centers  of  consciousness  in  the  human  body.  Accordingly,  he <br/>sees  in  the  elastic  ball  the  pineal  gland  and  in  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  the  dual  electric  current <br/>directed  along  the  spinal  column.  Unfortunately,  Mr.  Pryse  did  not  translate  that  portion  of  the  Popol <br/>Vuh  dealing  directly  with  the  initiatory  ceremonial.  Xibalba  he  considers  to  be  the  shadowy  or  etheric <br/>sphere  which,  according  to  the  Mystery  teachings,  was  located  within  the  body  of  the  planet  itself.  The <br/>fourth  book  of  the  Popol  Vuh  concludes  with  an  account  of  the  erection  of  a  majestic  temple,  all  white. <br/><br/><br/>where  was  preserved  a  secret  black  divining  stone,  cubical  in  shape.  Gucumatz  (or  Quetzalcoatl) <br/>partakes  of  many  of  the  attributes  of  King  Solomon:  the  account  of  the  temple  building  in  the  Popol <br/>Vuh  is  a  reminder  of  the  story  of  Solomon's  Temple,  and  undoubtedly  has  a  similar  significance. <br/>Brasseur  de  Bourbourg  was  first  attracted  to  the  study  of  religious  parallelisms  in  the  Popol  Vuh  by <br/>the  fact  that  the  temple  together  with  the  black  stone  which  it  contained,  was  named  the  Caabaha,  a <br/>name  astonishingly  similar  to  that  of  the  Temple,  or  Caaba,  which  contains  the  sacred  black  stone  of <br/>Islam. <br/><br/>The  exploits  of  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  take  place  before  the  actual  creation  of  the  human  race  and <br/>therefore  are  to  be  considered  essentially  as  spiritual  mysteries.  Xibalba  doubtless  signifies  the <br/>inferior  universe  of  Chaldean  and  Pythagorean  philosophy;  the  princes  of  Xibalba  are  the  twelve <br/>Governors  of  the  lower  universe;  and  the  two  dummies  or  manikins  in  their  midst  may  be  interpreted <br/>as  the  two  false  signs  of  the  ancient  zodiac  inserted  in  the  heavens  to  make  the  astronomical <br/>Mysteries  incomprehensible  to  the  profane.  The  descent  of  Hunahpu  and  Xbalanque  into  the <br/>subterranean  kingdom  of  Xibalba  by  crossing  over  the  rivers  on  bridges  made  from  their  blowguns <br/>has  a  subtle  analogy  to  the  descent  of  the  spiritual  nature  of  man  into  the  physical  body  through <br/>certain  superphysical  channels  that  maybe  likened  to  the  blowguns  or  tubes.  The  sabarcan  is  also  an <br/>appropriate  emblem  of  the  spinal  cord  and  the  power  resident  within  its  tiny  central  opening.  The  two <br/>youths  are  invited  to  play  the  &quot;Game  of  Life&quot;  with  the  Gods  of  Death,  and  only  with  the  aid  of <br/>supernatural  power  imparted  to  them  by  the  &quot;Sages&quot;  can  they  triumph  over  these  gloomy  lords.  The <br/>tests  represent  the  soul  wandering  through  the  sub-zodiacal  realms  of  the  created  universe;  their  final <br/>victory  over  the  Lords  of  Death  represents  the  ascension  of  the  spiritual  and  illumined  consciousness <br/>from  the  tower  nature  which  has  been  wholly  consumed  by  the  fire  of  spiritual  purification. <br/><br/>That  the  Quiches  possessed  the  keys  to  the  mystery  of  regeneration  is  evident  from  an  analysis  of  the <br/>symbols  appearing  upon  the  images  of  their  priests  and  gods.  In  Vol.  II  of  the  Anales  delMuseo <br/>Nacional  de  Mexico  is  reproduced  the  head  of  an  image  generally  considered  to  represent <br/>Quetzalcoatl.  The  sculpturing  is  distinctly  Oriental  in  character  and  on  the  crown  of  the  head  appear <br/>both  the  thousand-petaled  sunburst  of  spiritual  illumination  and  the  serpent  of  the  liberated  spinal <br/>fire.  The  Hindu  chakra  is  unmistakable  and  it  frequently  appears  in  the  religious  art  of  the  three <br/>Americas.  One  of  the  carved  monoliths  of  Central  America  is  adorned  with  the  heads  of  two  elephants <br/>with  their  drivers.  No  such  animals  have  existed  in  the  Western  Hemisphere  since  prehistoric  times <br/>and  it  is  evident  that  the  carvings  are  the  result  of  contact  with  the  distant  continent  of  Asia.  Among <br/>the  Mysteries  of  the  Central  American  Indians  is  a  remarkable  doctrine  concerning  the  consecrated <br/>mantles  or,  as  they  were  called  in  Europe,  magic  capes.  Because  their  glory  was  fatal  to  mortal  vision, <br/>the  gods,  when  appearing  to  the  initiated  priests,  robed  themselves  in  these  mantles.  Allegory  and <br/>fable  likewise  are  the  mantles  with  which  the  secret  doctrine  is  ever  enveloped.  Such  a  magic  cape  of <br/>concealment  is  the  Popol  Vuh,  and  deep  within  its  folds  sits  the  god  of  Quiche  philosophy.  The <br/>massive  pyramids,  temples,  and  monoliths  of  Central  America  may  be  likened  also  to  the  feet  of  gods, <br/>whose  upper  parts  are  enshrouded  in  magic  mantles  of  invisibility. <br/><br/><br/>p.  197 <br/><br/><br/>The  Mysteries  and  Their  Emissaries <br/><br/>DID  that  divine  knowledge  which  constituted  the  supreme  possession  of  the  pagan  priestcrafts <br/>survive  the  destruction  of  their  temples?  Is  it  yet  accessible  to  mankind,  or  does  it  lie  buried  beneath <br/>the  rubbish  of  ages,  entombed  within  the  very  sanctuaries  that  were  once  illuminated  by  its  splendor? <br/>&quot;In  Egypt,&quot;  writes  Origen,  &quot;the  philosophers  have  a  sublime  and  secret  knowledge  respecting  the <br/>nature  of  God.  What  did  Julian  imply  when  he  spoke  of  the  secret  initiations  into  the  sacred  Mysteries <br/>of  the  Seven-Rayed  God  who  lifted  souls  to  salvation  through  His  own  nature?  Who  were  the  blessed <br/>theurgists  who  understood  them  profundities  concerning  which  Julian  dared  not  speak?  If  this  inner <br/>doctrine  were  always  concealed  from  the  masses,  for  whom  a  simpler  code  had  been  devised,  is  it  not <br/>highly  probable  that  the  exponents  of  every  aspect  of  modern  civilization&#x2014;philosophic,  ethical, <br/>religious,  and  scientific-are  ignorant  of  the  true  meaning  of  the  very  theories  and  tenets  on  which <br/>their  beliefs  are  founded?  Do  the  arts  and  sciences  that  the  race  has  inherited  from  older  nations <br/>conceal  beneath  their /air  exterior  a  mystery  so  great  that  only  the  most  illumined  intellect  can  grasp <br/>its  import?  Such  is  undoubtedly  the  case. <br/><br/>Albert  Pike,  who  has  gathered  ample  evidence  of  the  excellence  of  the  doctrines  promulgated  by  the <br/>Mysteries,  supports  his  assertions  by  quoting  from  the  writings  of  Clement  of  Alexandria,  Plato, <br/>Epictetus,  Proclus,  Aristophanes,  and  Cicero,  all  of  whom  unite  in  lauding  the  high  ideals  of  these <br/>institutions.  From  the  unqualified  testimony  of  such  reputable  authorities  no  reasonable  doubt  can <br/>exist  that  the  initiates  of  Greece,  Egypt,  and  other  ancient  countries  possessed  the  correct  solution  to <br/>those  great  cultural,  intellectual,  moral,  and  social  problems  which  in  an  unsolved  state  confront  the <br/>humanity  of  the  twentieth  century.  The  reader  must  not  interpret  this  statement  to  mean  that <br/>antiquity  had  foreseen  and  analyzed  every  complexity  of  this  generation,  but  rather  that  the  Mysteries <br/>had  evolved  a  method  whereby  the  mind  was  so  trained  in  the  fundamental  verities  of  life  that  it  was <br/>able  to  cope  intelligently  v\dth  any  emergency  which  might  arise.  Thus  the  reasoning  faculties  were <br/>organized  by  a  simple  process  of  mental  culture,  for  it  was  asserted  that  where  reason  reigns  supreme, <br/>inconsistency  cannot  exist.  Wisdom,  it  was  maintained,  lifts  man  to  the  condition  of  Godhood,  a  fact <br/>which  explains  the  enigmatical  statement  that  the  Mysteries  transformed  &quot;roaring  beasts  into <br/>divinities.&quot; <br/><br/>The  preeminence  of  any  philosophical  system  can  be  determined  only  by  the  excellence  of  its <br/>products.  The  Mysteries  have  demonstrated  the  superiority  of  their  culture  by  giving  to  the  world <br/>minds  of  such  overwhelming  greatness,  souls  of  such  beatific  vision,  and  lives  of  such  outstanding <br/>impeccability  that  even  after  the  lapse  of  ages  the  teachings  of  these  individuals  constitute  the  present <br/>spiritual,  intellectual,  and  ethical  standards  of  the  race.  The  initiates  of  the  various  Mystery  schools  of <br/>past  ages  form  a  veritable  golden  chain  of  supermen  and  superwomen  connecting  heaven  and  earth. <br/>They  are  the  links  of  that  Homeric  &quot;golden  chain&quot;  with  which  Zeus  boasted  he  could  bind  the  several <br/>parts  of  the  universe  to  the  pinnacle  of  Olympus.  The  sons  and  daughters  of  Isis  are  indeed  an <br/>illustrious  line&#x2014;founders  of  sciences  and  philosophies,  patrons  of  arts  and  crafts,  supporting  by  the <br/>transcendency  of  their  divinely  given  power  the  structures  of  world  religions  erected  to  do  them <br/>homage.  Founders  of  doctrines  which  have  molded  the  lives  of  uncounted  generations,  these  Initiate- <br/>Teachers  bear  witness  to  that  spiritual  culture  which  has  always  existed&#x2014; and  always  will  exist&#x2014; as  a <br/>divine  institution  in  the  world  of  men. <br/><br/>Those  who  represent  an  ideal  beyond  the  comprehension  of  the  masses  must  face  the  persecution  of <br/>the  unthinking  multitude  who  are  without  that  divine  idealism  which  inspires  progress  and  those <br/>rational  faculties  which  unerringly  sift  truth  from  falsehood.  The  lot  of  the  Initiate-Teacher  is <br/>therefore  almost  invariably  an  unhappy  one.  Pythagoras,  crucified  and  his  university  burned;  Hypatia, <br/>torn  from  her  chariot  and  rended  limb  from  limb;  Jacques  de  Molay,  whose  memory  survives  the <br/><br/><br/>consuming  flame;  Savonarola,  burned  in  the  square  of  Florence;  Galileo,  forced  to  recant  upon <br/>bended  knee;  Giordano  Bruno,  burned  by  the  Inquisition;  Roger  Bacon,  compelled  to  carry  on  his <br/>experiments  in  the  secrecy  of  his  cell  and  leave  his  knowledge  hidden  under  cipher;  Dante  Alighieri, <br/>dying  in  exile  from  his  beloved  city;  Francis  Bacon,  patient,  under  the  burden  of  persecution; <br/>Cagliostro,  the  most  vilified  man  of  modern  times&#x2014;all  this  illustrious  line  bear  unending  witness  of <br/>man's  inhumanity  to  man.  The  world  has  ever  been  prone  to  heap  plaudits  upon  its  fools  and  calumny <br/>upon  its  thinkers.  Here  and  there  notable  exceptions  occur,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Comte  de  St.- <br/>Germain,  a  philosopher  who  survived  his  inquisitors  and  through  the  sheer  transcendency  of  his <br/>genius  won  a  position  of  comparative  immunity.  But  even  the  illustrious  Comte&#x2014;whose  illumined <br/>intellect  merited  the  homage  of  the  world&#x2014;could  not  escape  being  branded  an  impostor,  a  charlatan, <br/>and  an  adventurer.  From  this  long  fist  of  immortal  men  and  women  who  have  represented  the <br/>Ancient  Wisdom  before  the  world,  three  have  been  chosen  as  outstanding  examples  for  more  detailed <br/>consideration:  the  first  the  most  eminent  woman  philosopher  of  all  ages;  the  second  the  most <br/>maligned  and  persecuted  man  since  the  beginning  of  Christian  Era;  the  third  the  most  brilliant  and <br/>the  most  successful  modem  exponent  of  this  Ancient  Wisdom. <br/><br/>HYPATIA <br/><br/>Sitting  in  the  chair  of  philosophy  previously  occupied  by  her  father,  Theon  the  mathematician,  the <br/>immortal  Hypatia  was  for  many  years  the  central  figure  in  the  Alexandrian  School  of  Neo-Platonism. <br/>Famed  alike  for  the  depth  of  her  learning  and  the  charm  of  her  person,  beloved  by  the  citizens  of <br/>Alexandria,  and  frequently  consulted  by  the  magistrates  of  that  city,  this  noble  woman  stands  out <br/>from  the <br/><br/><br/>THE  TABLE  OF  CEBES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Vaenius'  Theatro  Moral  de  la  Vida  Humana. <br/><br/>There  is  legend  to  the  effect  that  the  Tablet  of  Cebes,  a  dialogue  between  Cebes  and  Gerundio,  was  based  upon  an  ancient <br/><br/>table  set  up  in  the  Temple  of  Kronos  at  Athens  or  Thebes  which  depicted  the  entire  progress  of  human  life.  The  author  of <br/>the  Tablet  of  Cebes  was  a  disciple  of  Socrates,  and  lived  about  390  B.C.  The  world  is  represented  as  a  great  mountain.  Out <br/>of  the  earth  at  the  base  of  it  come  he  myriads  of  human  creatures  who  climb  upward  in  search  of  truth  and  immortality. <br/>Above  the  clouds  which  conceal  the  summit  of  the  mountain  is  the  goal  of  human  attainment&#x2014;true  happiness.  The  figures <br/><br/><br/>and  groups  are  arranged  as  follows:  (i)  the  door  of  the  wall  of  life;  (2)  the  Genius  or  Intelligence;  (3)  deceit  (4)  opinions, <br/>desires,  and  pleasures;  (5)  fortune;  (6)  the  strong;  (7)  venery,  insatiability,  flattery;  (8)  sorrow;  (9)  sadness;  (10)  misery; <br/>(11)  grief,  (12)  rage  or  despair;  (13)  the  house  of  misfortune;  (14)  penitence;  (15)  true  opinion;  (16)  false  opinion;  (17)  false <br/>doctrine;  (18)  poets,  orators,  geometers,  et.  al.;  (19)  incontinence,  sexual  indulgence,  and  opinion;  (20)  the  road  of  the <br/>true  doctrine  (21)  continence  and  patience;  (22)  the  true  doctrine;  (23)  truth  and  persuasion;  (24)  science  and  the  virtues; <br/>(25)  happiness,  (26)  the  highest  (first)  pleasure  of  the  wise  man;  (27)  the  lazy  and  the  strays. <br/><br/>p.  198 <br/><br/>pages  of  history  as  the  greatest  of  the  pagan  martyrs.  A  personal  disciple  of  the  magician  Plutarch, <br/>and  versed  in  the  profundities  of  the  Platonic  School,  Hypatia  eclipsed  in  argument  and  public  esteem <br/>every  proponent  of  the  Christian  doctrines  in  Northern  Egypt.  While  her  writings  perished  at  the  time <br/>of  the  burning  of  the  library  of  Alexandria  by  the  Mohammedans,  some  hint  of  their  nature  may  be <br/>gleaned  from  the  statements  of  contemporaneous  authors.  Hypatia  evidently  wrote  a  commentary  on <br/>the  Arithmetic  of  Diophantus,  another  on  the  Astronomical  Canon  of  Ptolemy,  and  a  third  on  the <br/>Conies  of  Apollonius  of  Perga.  Synesius,  Bishop  of  Ptolemais,  her  devoted  friend,  wrote  to  Hypatia  for <br/>assistance  in  the  construction  of  an  astrolabe  and  a  hydroscope.  Recognizing  the  transcendenqr  of  her <br/>intellect,  the  learned  of  many  nations  flocked  to  the  academy  where  she  lectured. <br/><br/>A  number  of  writers  have  credited  the  teachings  of  Hypatia  with  being  Christian  in  spirit;  in  fact  she <br/>removed  the  veil  of  mystery  in  which  the  new  cult  had  enshrouded  itself,  discoursing  with  such  clarity <br/>upon  its  most  involved  principles  that  many  newly  converted  to  the  Christian  faith  deserted  it  to <br/>become  her  disciples.  Hypatia  not  only  proved  conclusively  the  pagan  origin  of  the  Christian  faith  but <br/>also  exposed  the  purported  miracles  then  advanced  by  the  Christians  as  tokens  of  divine  preference <br/>by  demonstrating  the  natural  laws  controlling  the  phenomena. <br/><br/>At  this  time  Cyril&#x2014; later  to  be  renowned  as  the  founder  of  the  doctrine  of  the  Christian  Trinity  and <br/>canonized  for  his  zeal&#x2014;was  Bishop  of  Alexandria.  Seeing  in  Hypatia  a  continual  menace  to  the <br/>promulgation  of  the  Christian  faith,  Cyril&#x2014;indirectly  at  least&#x2014; was  the  cause  of  her  tragic  end.  Despite <br/>every  later  effort  to  exonerate  him  from  the  stigma  of  her  murder,  the  incontrovertible  fact  remains <br/>that  he  made  no  effort  to  avert  the  foul  and  brutal  crime.  The  only  shred  of  excuse  which  might  be <br/>offered  in  his  defense  is  that,  blinded  by  the  spell  of  fanaticism,  Cyril  considered  Hypatia  to  be  a <br/>sorceress  in  league  with  the  Devil.  In  contrast  to  the  otherwise  general  excellence  of  the  literary  works <br/>of  Charles  Kingsley  maybe  noted  his  puerile  delineation  of  character  of  Hypatia  in  his  book  by  that <br/>name.  Without  exception,  the  meager  historical  references  to  this  virgin  philosopher  attest  her  virtue, <br/>integrity,  and  absolute  devotion  to  the  principles  of  Truth  and  Right. <br/><br/>While  it  is  true  that  the  best  minds  of  the  Christianity  of  that  period  may  readily  be  absolved  from  the <br/>charge  of  participes  criminis,  the  implacable  hatred  of  Cyril  unquestionably  communicated  itself  to <br/>the  more  fanatical  members  of  his  faith,  particularly  to  a  group  of  monks  from  the  Nitrian  desert.  Led <br/>by  Peter  the  Reader,  a  savage  and  illiterate  man,  they  attacked  Hypatia  on  the  open  street  as  she  was <br/>passing  from  the  academy  to  her  home.  Dragging  the  defenseless  woman  from  her  chariot,  they  took <br/>her  to  the  Caesarean  Church.  Tearing  away  her  garments,  they  pounded  her  to  death  with  clubs,  after <br/>which  they  scraped  the  flesh  from  her  bones  with  oyster  shells  and  carried  the  mutilated  remains  to  a <br/>place  called  Cindron,  where  they  burned  them  to  ashes. <br/><br/>Thus  perished  in  A.D.  415  the  greatest  woman  initiate  of  the  ancient  world,  and  with  her  fell  also  the <br/>Neo-Platonic  School  of  Alexandria.  The  memory  of  Hypatia  has  probably  been  perpetuated  in  the <br/>hagiolatry  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  the  person  of  St.  Catherine  of  Alexandria. <br/><br/>THE  COMTE  DI  CAGLIOSTRO <br/><br/>The  &quot;divine&quot;  Cagliostro,  one  moment  the  idol  of  Paris,  the  next  a  lonely  prisoner  in  a  dungeon  of  the <br/>Inquisition,  passed  like  a  meteor  across  the  face  of  France.  According  to  his  memoirs  written  by  him <br/><br/><br/>during  his  confinement  in  the  Bastille,  Alessandro  Cagliostro  was  bom  in  Malta  of  a  noble  but <br/>unknown  family.  He  was  reared  and  educated  in  Arabia  under  the  tutelage  of  Altotas,  a  man  well <br/>versed  in  several  branches  of  philosophy  and  science  and  also  a  master  of  the  transcendental  arts. <br/>While  Cagliostro's  biographers  generally  ridicule  this  account,  they  utterly  fail  to  advance  in  its  stead <br/>any  logical  solution  for  the  source  of  his  magnificent  store  of  arcane  knowledge. <br/><br/>Branded  as  an  impostor  and  a  charlatan,  his  miracles  declared  to  be  legerdemain,  and  his  very <br/>generosity  suspected  of  an  ulterior  motive,  the  Comte  di  Cagliostro  is  undoubtedly  the  most <br/>calumniated  man  in  modem  history.  &quot;The  mistrust,&quot;  writes  W.  H.  K.  Trowbridge,  &quot;that  mystery  and <br/>magic  always  inspire  made  Cagliostro  with  his  fantastic  personality  an  easy  target  for  calumny.  After <br/>having  been  riddled  with  abuse  till  he  was  unrecognizable,  prejudice,  the  foster  child  of  calumny, <br/>proceeded  to  lynch  him,  so  to  speak.  For  over  one  hundred  years  his  character  has  dangled  on  the <br/>gibbet  of  infamy,  upon  which  the  sbirri  of  tradition  have  inscribed  a  curse  on  any  one  who  shall <br/>attempt  to  cut  him  down.  His  fate  has  been  his  fame.  He  is  remembered  in  history,  not  so  much  for <br/>anything  he  did,  as  for  what  was  done  to  him.&quot;  (See  Cagliostro,  the  Splendour  and  Misery  of  a <br/>Master  of  Magic.) <br/><br/>According  to  popular  belief  Cagliostro's  real  name  was  Giuseppe  Balsamo,  and  he  was  a  Sicilian  by <br/>birth.  Within  recent  years,  however,  doubts  have  arisen  as  to  whether  this  belief  is  in  accord  with  the <br/>facts.  It  may  yet  be  proved  that  in  part,  at  least,  the  tirades  of  abuse  heaped  upon  the  unfortunate <br/>Comte  have  been  directed  against  the  wrong  man.  Giuseppe  Balsamo  was  born  in  1743  of  honest  but <br/>humble  parentage.  From  boyhood  he  exhibited  selfish,  worthless,  and  even  criminal  tendencies,  and <br/>after  a  series  of  escapades  disappeared.  Trowbridge(/oc.  cit.)  presents  ample  proof  that  Cagliostro  was <br/>not  Giuseppe  Balsamo,  thus  disposing  of  the  worst  accusation  against  him.  After  six  months' <br/>imprisonment  in  the  Bastille,  on  his  trial  Cagliostro  was  exonerated  from  any  implication  in  the  theft <br/>of  the  famous  &quot;Queen's  Necklace,&quot;  and  later  the  fact  was  established  that  he  had  actually  warned <br/>Cardinal  de  Rohan  of  the  intended  crime.  Despite  the  fact,  however,  that  he  was  discharged  as <br/>innocent  by  the  French  trial  court,  a  deliberate  effort  to  vilify  Cagliostro  was  made  by  an  artist&#x2014;more <br/>talented  than  intelligent &#x2014;who  painted  a  picture  showing  him  holding  the  fatal  necklace  in  his  hand. <br/>The  trial  of  Cagliostro  has  been  called  the  prologue  of  the  French  Revolution.  The  smoldering <br/>animosity  against  Marie  Antoinette  and  Louis  XVI  engendered  by  this  trial  later  burst  forth  as  the <br/>holocaust  of  the  Reign  of  Terror.  In  his  brochure,  Cagliostro  and  His  Egyptian  Rite  of  Freemasonry, <br/>Henry  R.  Evans  also  ably  defends  this  much  persecuted  man  against  the  infamies  so  unjustly  linked <br/>with  his  name. <br/><br/>Sincere  investigators  of  the  facts  surrounding  the  life  and  mysterious  &quot;death&quot;  of  Cagliostro  are  of  the <br/>opinion  that  the  stories  circulated  against  him  may  be  traced  to  the  machinations  of  the  Inquisition, <br/>which  in  this  manner  sought  to  justify  his  persecution.  The  basic  charge  against  Cagliostro  was  that <br/>he  had  attempted  to  found  a  Masonic  lodge  in  Rome&#x2014;nothing  more.  All  other  accusations  are  of <br/>subsequent  date.  For  some  reason  undisclosed,  the  Pope  commuted  Cagliostro's  sentence  of  death  to <br/>perpetual  imprisonment.  This  act  in  itself  showed  the  regard  in  which  Cagliostro  was  held  even  by  his <br/>enemies.  While  his  death  is  believed  to  have  occurred  several  years  later  in  an  Inquisitional  dungeon <br/>in  the  castle  of  San  Leo,  it  is  highly  improbable  that  such  was  the  case.  There  are  rumors  that  he <br/>escaped,  and  according  to  one  very  significant  story  Cagliostro  fled  to  India,  where  his  talents <br/>received  the  appreciation  denied  them  in  politics-ridden  Europe. <br/><br/>After  creating  his  Egyptian  Rite,  Cagliostro  declared  that  since  women  had  been  admitted  into  the <br/>ancient  Mysteries  there  was  no  reason  why  they  should  be  excluded  from  the  modem  orders.  The <br/>Princesse  de  Lamballe  graciously  accepted  the  dignity  of  Mistress  of  Honor  in  his  secret  society,  and <br/>on  the  evening  of  her  initiation  the  most  important  members  of  the  French  court  were  present.  The <br/>brilliance  of  the  affair  attracted  the  attention  of  the  Masonic  lodges  in  Paris.  Their  representatives,  in <br/>a  sincere  desire  to  understand  the  Masonic  Mysteries,  chose  the  learned  orientalist  Court  de  Gebelin <br/><br/><br/>as  their  spokesman,  and  invited  Comte  di  Cagliostro  to  attend  a  conference  to  assist  in  clearing  up  a <br/>number  of  important  questions  concerning  Masonic  philosophy.  The  Comte  accepted  the  invitation. <br/><br/>On  May  lo,  1785,  Cagliostro  attended  the  conference  called  for  that  purpose,  and  his  power  and <br/>simplicity  immediately  won  for  him  the  favorable  opinion  of  the  entire  gathering.  It  took  but  a  few <br/>words  for  the  Court  de  Gebelin  to  discover  that  he  was  talking  nor  only  to  a  fellow  scholar  but  to  a <br/>man  infinitely  his  superior.  Cagliostro  immediately  presented  an  address,  which  was  so  unexpected, <br/>so  totally  different  from  anything  ever  heard  before  by  those  assembled,  that  all  were  speechless  with <br/>amazement.  Cagliostro  declared  the  Rose-Cross  to  be  the  ancient  and  true  symbol  of  the  Mysteries <br/>and,  after  a  brief  description  of  its  original  symbolism,  branched  out  into  a  consideration  of  the <br/>symbolic  meaning  of  letters,  predicting  to  the  assembly  the  future  of  France  in  a  graphic  manner  that <br/>left  no  room  for  doubt  that  the  speaker  was  a  man  of  insight  and  supernatural  power.  With  a  curious <br/>arrangement  of  the  letters  of  the  alphabet,  Cagliostro  foretold  in  detail  the  horrors  of  the  coming <br/>revolution  and  the  fall  of  the  monarchy,  describing  minutely  the  fate  of  the  various  members  of  the <br/>royal  family.  He  also  prophesied  the  advent  of  Napoleon  and  the  rise  of  the  First  Empire.  All  this  he <br/>did  to  demonstrate  that  which  can  be  accomplished  by  superior  knowledge. <br/><br/>Later  when  arrested  and  sent  to  the  Bastille,  Cagliostro  wrote  on  the  wall  of  his  cell  the  following <br/>cryptic  message  which,  when  interpreted,  reads:  &quot;In  1789  the  besieged  Bastille  will  on  July  14th  be <br/>pulled  down  by  you  from  top  to  bottom.&quot;  Cagliostro  was  the  mysterious  agent  of  the  Knights <br/>Templars,  the  Rosicrucian  initiate  whose  magnificent  store  of  learning  is  attested  by  the  profundity  of <br/>the  Egyptian  Rite  of  Freemasonry.  Thus  Comte  di  Cagliostro  remains  one  of  the  strangest  characters <br/>in  history&#x2014;believed  by  his  friends  to  have  lived  forever  and  to  have  taken  part  in  the  marriage  feast  of <br/>Cana,  and  accused  by  his  enemies  of  being  the  Devil  incarnate!  His  powers  of  prophecy  are  ably <br/>described  by  Alexandre  Dumas  in  The  Queen's  Necklace.  The  world  he  sought  to  serve  in  his  own <br/><br/>p.  199 <br/><br/>strange  way  received  him  not,  but  has  followed  with  relentless  persecution  down  through  the <br/>centuries  even  the  very  memory  of  this  illustrious  adept  who,  unable  to  accomplish  the  great  labor  at <br/>hand,  stepped  aside  in  favor  of  his  more  successful  compatriot,  the  Comte  de  St-Germain. <br/><br/>THE  COMTE  DE  ST.-GERMAIN <br/><br/>During  the  early  part  of  the  eighteenth  century  there  appeared  in  the  diplomatic  circles  of  Europe  the <br/>most  baffling  personality  of  history&#x2014;a  man  whose  life  was  so  near  a  synonym  of  mystery  that  the <br/>enigma  of  his  true  identity  was  as  insolvable  to  his  contemporaries  as  it  has  been  to  later  investigators. <br/>The  Comte  de  St. -Germain  was  recognized  as  the  outstanding  scholar  and  linguist  of  his  day.  His <br/>versatile  accomplishments  extended  from  chemistry  and  history  to  poetry  and  music.  He  played <br/>several  musical  instruments  with  great  skill  and  among  his  numerous  compositions  was  a  short  opera. <br/>He  was  also  an  artist  of  rare  ability  and  the  remarkably  luminous  effects  which  he  created  on  canvas <br/>are  believed  to  have  been  the  result  of  his  mixing  powdered  mother-of-pearl  with  his  pigments.  He <br/>gained  worldwide  distinction  for  his  ability  to  reproduce  in  his  paintings  the  original  luster  of  the <br/>precious  stones  appearing  upon  the  costumes  of  his  subjects.  His  linguistic  proficiency  verged  on  the <br/>supernatural.  He  spoke  German,  English,  Italian,  Portuguese,  Spanish,  French  with  a  Piedmontese <br/>accent,  Greek,  Latin,  Sanskrit,  Arabic,  and  Chinese  with  such  fluency  that  in  every  land  he  visited  he <br/>was  accepted  as  a  native.  He  was  ambidextrous  to  such  a  degree  that:  he  could  write  the  same  article <br/>with  both  hands  simultaneously.  When  the  two  pieces  of  paper  were  afterwards  placed  together  with <br/>a  light  behind  them,  the  writing  on  one  sheet  exactly  covered,  letter  for  letter,  the  writing  on  the  other. <br/><br/>As  a  historian,  the  Comte  de  St.-Germain  possessed  uncanny  knowledge  of  every  occurrence  of  the <br/>preceding  two  thousand  years,  and  in  his  reminiscences  he  described  in  intimate  detail  events  of <br/>previous  centuries  in  which  he  had  played  important  roles.  He  assisted  Mesmer  in  developing  the <br/><br/><br/>theory  of  mesmerism,  and  in  all  probability  was  the  actual  discoverer  of  that  science.  His  knowledge <br/><br/>of  chemistry  was  so  profound  that  he  could  remove  flaws  from  diamonds  and  other  precious  stones&#x2014;a <br/>feat  which  he  actually  performed  at  the  request  of  Louis  XV  in  1757.  He  was  also  recognized  as  an  art <br/>critic  without  a  peer  and  was  often  consulted  regarding  paintings  accredited  to  the  great  masters.  His <br/>claim  to  the  possession  of  the  fabled  elixir  of  life  was  home  witness  to  by  Madame  de  Pompadour, <br/>who  discovered,  she  declared,  that  he  had  presented  a  lady  of  the  court  with  a  certain  priceless  liquid <br/>which  had  had  the  effect  of  preserving  her  youthful  vivacity  and  beauty  for  over  twenty-five  years <br/>beyond  the  normal  term. <br/><br/>The  startling  accuracy  of  his  prophetic  utterances  gained  for  him  no  small  degree  of  fame.  To  Marie <br/>Antoinette  he  predicted  the  fall  of  the  French  monarchy,  and  he  was  also  aware  of  the  unhappy  fate  of <br/>the  royal  family  years  before  the  Revolution  actually  took  place.  The  crowning  evidence,  however,  of <br/>the  Comte's  genius  was  his  penetrating  grasp  of  the  political  situation  of  Europe  and  the  consummate <br/>skill  with  which  he  parried  the  thrusts  of  his  diplomatic  adversaries.  He  was  employed  by  a  number  of <br/>European  governments,  including  the  French,  as  a  secret  agent,  and  at  all  times  bore  credentials <br/>which  gave  him  entree  to  the  most  exclusive  circles. <br/><br/>In  her  excellent  monograph.  The  Comte  de  St.-Germain,  the  Secret  of  Kings,  Mrs.  Cooper-Oakley  lists <br/>the  most  important  names  under  which  this  amazing  person  masqueraded  between  the  years  1710 <br/>and  1822.  &quot;During  this  time,&quot;  she  writes,  &quot;we  have  M.  de  St.-Germain  as  the  Marquis  de  Montferrat, <br/>Comte  Bellamarre  or  Aymar  at  Venice,  Chevalier  Schoening  at  Pisa,  Chevalier  Weldon  at  Milan  and <br/>Leipzig,  Comte  Soltikoff  at  Genoa  and  Leghorn,  Graf  Tzarogy  at  Schwalbach  and  Triesdorf,  Prinz <br/>Ragoczy  at  Dresden,  and  Comte  de  St.-Germain  at  Paris,  The  Hague,  London,  and  St.  Petersburg.&quot;  It <br/>is  evident  that  M.  de  St.-Germain  adopted  these  various  names  in  the  interests  of  the  political  secret <br/>service  work  which  historians  have  presumed  to  be  the  major  mission  of  his  life. <br/><br/>The  Comte  de  St.-Germain  has  been  described  as  of  medium  height,  well  proportioned  in  body,  and <br/>of  regular  and  pleasing  features.  His  complexion  was  somewhat  swarthy  and  his  hair  dark,  though <br/>often  shown  powdered.  He  dressed  simply,  usually  in  black,  but  his  clothes  were  well  fitting  and  of <br/>the  best  quality.  He  had  apparently  a  mania  for  diamonds,  which  he  wore  not  only  in  rings  but  also  in <br/>his  watch  and  chain,  his  snuffbox,  and  upon  his  buckles.  A  jeweler  once  estimated  the  value  of  his <br/>shoe  buckles  at  200,000  francs.  The  Comte  is  generally  depicted  as  a  man  in  middle  life,  entirely <br/>devoid  of  wrinkles  and  free  from  any  physical  infirmity.  He  ate  no  meat  and  drank  no  wine,  in  fact <br/>seldom  dined  in  the  presence  of  any  second  person.  Although  he  was  looked  upon  as  a  charlatan  and <br/>impostor  by  a  few  nobles  at  the  French  court,  Louis  XV  severely  reprimanded  a  courtier  who  made  a <br/>disparaging  remark  concerning  him.  The  grace  and  dignity  that  characterized  his  conduct,  together <br/>with  his  perfect  control  of  every  situation,  attested  the  innate  refinement  and  culture  of  one  &quot;to  the <br/>manner  born.&quot;  This  remarkable  person  also  had  the  surprising  and  impressive  ability  to  divine,  even <br/>to  the  most  minute  details,  the  questions  of  his  inquisitors  before  they  were  asked.  By  something  akin <br/>to  telepathy  he  was  also  able  to  feel  when  his  presence  was  needed  in  some  distant  city  or  state,  and  it <br/>has  even  been  recorded  of  him  that  he  had  the  astonishing  habit  not  only  of  appearing  in  his  own <br/>apartment  and  in  those  of  friends  without  resorting  to  the  conventionality  of  the  door  but  also  of <br/>departing  therefrom  in  a  similar  manner. <br/><br/>M.  de  St. -Germain's  travels  covered  many  countries.  During  the  reign  of  Peter  III  he  was  in  Russia <br/>and  between  the  years  1737  and  1742  in  the  court  of  the  Shah  of  Persia  as  an  honored  guest.  On  the <br/>subject:  of  his  wanderings  Una  Birch  writes:  &quot;The  travels  of  the  Comte  de  Saint-Germain  covered  a <br/>long  period  of  years  and  a  great  range  of  countries.  From  Persia  to  France  and  from  Calcutta  to  Rome <br/>he  was  known  and  respected.  Horace  Walpole  spoke  with  him  in  London  in  1745;  Clive  knew  him  in <br/>India  in  1756;  Madame  d'Adhemar  alleges  that  she  met  him  in  Paris  in  1789,  five  years  after  his <br/>supposed  death;  while  other  persons  pretend  to  have  held  conversations  with  him  in  the  early <br/>nineteenth  century.  He  was  on  familiar  and  intimate  terms  with  the  crowned  heads  of  Europe  and  the <br/>honoured  friend  of  many  distinguished  persons  of  all  nationalities.  He  is  even  mentioned  in  the <br/><br/><br/>memoirs  and  letters  of  the  day,  and  always  as  a  man  of  mystery.  Frederick  the  Great,  Voltaire, <br/>Madame  de  Pompadour,  Rousseau,  Chatham,  and  Walpole,  all  of  whom  knew  him  personally, <br/>rivalled  each  other  in  curiosity  as  to  his  origin.  During  the  many  decades  in  which  he  was  before  the <br/>world,  however,  no  one  succeeded  in  discovering  why  he  appeared  as  a  Jacobite  agent  in  London,  as  a <br/>conspirator  in  Petersburg,  as  an  alchemist  and  connoisseur  of  pictures  in  Paris,  or  as  a  Russian <br/>general  at  Naples.  *  *  *  Now  and  again  the  curtain  which  shrouds  his  actions  is  drawn  aside,  and  we <br/>are  permitted  to  see  him  fiddling  in  the  music  room  at  Versailles,  gossiping  with  Horace  Walpole  in <br/>London,  sitting  in  Frederick  the  Great's  library  at  Berlin,  or  conducting  illuminist  meetings  in  caverns <br/>by  the  Rhine.&quot;  (See  The  Nineteenth  Century,  January,  1908.) <br/><br/>The  Comte  de  St. -Germain  has  been  generally  regarded  as  an  important  figure  in  early  activities  of <br/>the  Freemasons.  Repeated  efforts,  however,  probably  with  an  ulterior  motive,  have  been  made  to <br/>discredit  his  Masonic  affiliations.  An  example  of  this  is  the  account  appearing  in  The  Secret  Tradition <br/>in  Freemasonry,  by  Arthur  Edward <br/><br/><br/>The  Comte  di  Cagliostro  is  described  as  a  man  not  overly  tall,  but  square  shouldered  and  deep  of  chest.  His  head,  which <br/>was  large,  was  abundantly  covered  with  black  hair  combed  back  from  his  broad  and  noble  forehead.  His  eyes  were  black <br/>and  very  brilliant,  and  when  he  spoke  with  great  feeling  upon  some  profound  subject  the  pupils  dilated,  his  eyebrows  rose, <br/>and  he  shook  his  head  like  a  maned  lion.  His  hands  and  feet  were  small&#x2014;an  indication  of  noble  birth&#x2014;and  his  whole <br/>bearing  was  one  of  dignity  and  studiousness.  He  was  filled  with  energy,  and  could  accomplish  a  prodigious  amount  of <br/>work.  He  dressed  somewhat  fantastically,  gave  so  freely  from  an  inexhaustible  purse  that  he  received  the  title  of  &quot;Father  of <br/>the  Poor,&quot;  accepted  nothing  from  anyone,  and  maintained  himself  in  magnificence  in  a  combined  temple  and  palace  in  the <br/>Rue  d,  la  Sourdiere.  According  to  his  ovra  statement  he  was  initiated  into  the  Mysteries  by  none  other  than  the  Comte  de <br/>St. -Germain.  He  had  traveled  through  all  parts  of  the  world,  and  in  the  ruins  of  ancient  Babylon  and  Nineveh  had <br/>discovered  wise  men  who  understood  all  the  secrets  of  human  life. <br/><br/><br/>[paragraph  continues]  Waite.  This  author,  after  making  several  rather  disparaging  remarks  on  the  subject, <br/>amplifies  his  article  by  reproducing  an  engraving  of  the  wrong  Comte  de  St. -Germain,  apparently <br/>being  unable  to  distinguish  between  the  great  illuminist  and  the  French  general.  It  will  yet  be <br/>established  beyond  all  doubt  that  the  Comte  de  St. -Germain  was  both  a  Mason  and  a  Templar;  in  fact <br/>the  memoirs  of  Cagliostro  contain  a  direct  statement  of  his  initiation  into  the  order  of  the  Knights <br/>Templars  at  the  hands  of  St. -Germain.  Many  of  the  illustrious  personages  with  whom  the  Comte  de <br/>St. -Germain  associated  were  high  Masons,  and  sufficient  memoranda  have  been  preserved <br/><br/><br/>THE  &quot;DIVINE&quot;  CAGLIOSTRO. <br/><br/><br/>From  Houdon's  Bust  of  Cagliostro. <br/><br/><br/>p.  200 <br/><br/><br/>concerning  the  discussions  which  they  held  to  prove  that  he  was  a  master  of  Freemasonic  lore.  It  is <br/>also  reasonably  certain  that  he  was  connected  with  the  Rosicrucians&#x2014;possibly  having  been  the  actual <br/>head  of  that  order. <br/><br/>The  Comte  de  St. -Germain  was  thoroughly  conversant  with  the  principles  of  Oriental  esotericism.  He <br/>practiced  the  Eastern  system  of  meditation  and  concentration,  upon  several  occasions  having  been <br/>seen  seated  with  his  feet  crossed  and  hands  folded  in  the  posture  of  a  Hindu  Buddha.  He  had  a  retreat <br/>in  the  heart  of  the  Himalayas  to  which  he  retired  periodically  from  the  world.  On  one  occasion  he <br/>declared  that  he  would  remain  in  India  for  eighty-five  years  and  then  would  return  to  the  scene  of  his <br/>European  labors.  At  various  times  he  admitted  that  he  was  obeying  the  orders  of  a  power  higher  and <br/>greater  than  himself.  What  he  did  not  say  was  that  this  superior  power  was  the  Mystery  school  which <br/>had  sent  him  into  the  world  to  accomplish  a  definite  mission.  The  Comte  de  St.-Germain  and  Sir <br/>Francis  Bacon  are  the  two  greatest  emissaries  sent  into  the  world  by  the  Secret  Brotherhood  in  the <br/>last  thousand  years. <br/><br/>E.  Francis  Udny,  a  Theosophical  writer,  is  of  the  belief  that  the  Comte  de  St.-Germain  was  not  the  son <br/>of  Prince  Rakoczy  of  Transylvania,  but  because  of  his  age  could  have  been  none  other  than  the  prince <br/>himself,  who  was  known  to  be  of  a  deep  philosophic  and  mystic  nature.  The  same  writer  believes  the <br/>Comte  de  St.-Germain  passed  through  the  &quot;philosophic  death&quot;  as  Francis  Bacon  in  1626,  as  Frangois <br/>Rakoczy  in  1735,  and  as  Comte  de  St.-Germain  in  1784.  He  also  feels  that  the  Comte  de  St.-Germain <br/>was  the  famous  Comte  de  Gabalis,  and  as  Count  Hompesch  was  the  last  Grand  Master  of  the  Knights <br/>of  Malta.  It  is  well  known  that  many  members  of  the  European  secret  societies  have  feigned  death  for <br/>various  purposes.  Marshal  Ney,  a  member  of  the  Society  of  Unknown  Philosophers,  escaped  the  firing <br/>squad  and  under  the  name  of  Peter  Stuart  Ney  lived  and  taught  school  for  over  thirty  years  in  North <br/>Carolina.  On  his  deathbed,  P.  S.  Ney  told  Doctor  Locke,  the  attending  physician,  that  he  was  Marshal <br/>Ney  of  France. <br/><br/>In  concluding  an  article  on  the  identity  of  the  inscrutable  Comte  de  St.-Germain,  Andrew  Lang  writes: <br/>&quot;Did  Saint-Germain  really  die  in  the  palace  of  Prince  Charles  of  Hesse  about  1780-85?  Did  he,  on  the <br/>other  hand,  escape  from  the  French  prison  where  Grosley  thought  he  saw  him,  during  the  French <br/>Revolution?  Was  he  known  to  Lord  Lytton  about  i860?  *  *  *  Is  he  the  mysterious  Muscovite  adviser <br/>of  the  Dalai  Lama?  Who  knows?  He  is  a  will-o'-the-wisp  of  the  memoir-writers  of  the  eighteenth <br/>century. &quot;  (See  Historical  Mysteries.) <br/><br/>EPISODES  FROM  AMERICAN  HISTORY <br/><br/>Many  times  the  question  has  been  asked.  Was  Francis  Bacon's  vision  of  the  &quot;New  Atlantis&quot;  a <br/>prophetic  dream  of  the  great  civilization  which  was  so  soon  to  rise  upon  the  soil  of  the  New  World?  It <br/>cannot  be  doubted  that  the  secret  societies  of  Europe  conspired  to  establish  upon  the  American <br/>continent  &quot;a  new  nation,  conceived  in  liberty  and  dedicated  to  the  proposition  that  all  men  are <br/>created  equal.&quot;  Two  incidents  in  the  early  history  of  the  United  States  evidence  the  influence  of  that <br/>silent  body  which  has  so  long  guided  the  destinies  of  peoples  and  religions.  By  them  nations  are <br/>created  as  vehicles  for  the  promulgation  of  ideals,  and  while  nations  are  true  to  these  ideals  they <br/>survive;  when  they  vary  from  them  they  vanish  like  the  Atlantis  of  old  which  had  ceased  to  &quot;know  the <br/>gods.&quot; <br/><br/>In  his  admirable  little  treatise.  Our  Flag,  Robert  Allen  Campbell  revives  the  details  of  an  obscure,  but <br/>most  important,  episode  of  American  history&#x2014;the  designing  of  the  Colonial  flag  of  1775.  The  account <br/>involves  a  mysterious  man  concerning  whom  no  information  is  available  other  than  that  he  was  on <br/>familiar  terms  with  both  General  George  Washington  and  Dr.  Benjamin  Franklin.  The  following <br/>description  of  him  is  taken  from  Campbell's  treatise: <br/><br/><br/>&quot;Little  seems  to  have  been  known  concerning  this  old  gentleman;  and  in  the  materials  from  which <br/><br/>this  account  is  compiled  his  name  is  not  even  once  mentioned,  for  he  is  uniformly  spoken  of  or <br/>referred  to  as  'the  Professor.'  He  was  evidently  far  beyond  his  threescore  and  ten  years;  and  he  often <br/>referred  to  historical  events  of  more  than  a  century  previous  just  as  if  he  had  been  a  living  witness  of <br/>their  occurrence;  still  he  was  erect,  vigorous  and  active&#x2014;hale,  hearty,  and  clear-minded~as  strong <br/>and  energetic  every  way  as  in  the  prime  of  his  life  He  was  tall,  of  fine  figure,  perfectly  easy,  and  very <br/>dignified  in  his  manners;  being  at  once  courteous,  gracious  and  commanding.  He  was,  for  those  times <br/>and  considering  the  customs  of  the  Colonists,  very  peculiar  in  his  method  of  living;  for  he  ate  no  flesh, <br/>fowl  or  fish;  he  never  used  for  food  any  'green  thing,'  any  roots  or  anything  unripe;  he  drank  no  liquor, <br/>wine  or  ale;  but  confined  his  diet  to  cereals  and  their  products,  fruits  that  were  ripened  on  the  stem  in <br/>the  sun,  nuts,  mild  tea  and  the  sweets  of  honey,  sugar  or  molasses. <br/><br/>&quot;He  was  well  educated,  highly  cultivated,  of  extensive  as  well  as  varied  information,  and  very  studious. <br/>He  spent  considerable  of  his  time  in  the  patient  and  persistent  conning  of  a  number  of  very  rare  old <br/>books  and  ancient  manuscripts  which  he  seemed  to  be  deciphering,  translating  or  rewriting.  These <br/>books  and  manuscripts,  together  with  his  own  writings,  he  never  showed  to  anyone;  and  he  did  not <br/>even  mention  them  in  his  conversations  with  the  family,  except  in  the  most  casual  way;  and  he  always <br/>locked  them  up  carefully  in  a  large,  old-fashioned,  cubically  shaped,  iron-bound,  heavy,  oaken  chest, <br/>whenever  he  left  his  room,  even  for  his  meals.  He  took  long  and  frequent  walks  alone,  sat  on  the <br/>brows  of  the  neighboring  hills,  or  mused  in  the  midst  of  the  green  and  flower-gemmed  meadows.  He <br/>was  fairly  liberal&#x2014;but  in  no  way  lavish&#x2014; in  spending  his  money,  with  which  he  was  well  supplied.  He <br/>was  a  quiet,  though  a  very  genial  and  very  interesting,  member  of  the  family;  and  be  was  seemingly  at <br/>home  upon  any  and  every  topic  coming  up  in  conversation.  He  was,  in  short,  one  whom  everyone <br/>would  notice  and  respect,  whom  few  would  feel  well  acquainted  with,  and  whom  no  one  would <br/>presume  to  question  concerning  himself&#x2014; as  to  whence  he  came,  why  he  tarried,  or  whither  he <br/>journeyed. &quot; <br/><br/>By  something  more  than  a  mere  coincidence  the  committee  appointed  by  the  Colonial  Congress  to <br/>design  a  flag  accepted  an  invitation  to  be  guests,  while  in  Cambridge,  of  the  same  family  with  which <br/>the  Professor  was  staying.  It  was  here  that  General  Washington  joined  them  for  the  purpose  of <br/>deciding  upon  a  fitting  emblem.  By  the  signs  which  passed  between  them  it  was  evident  that  both <br/>General  Washington  and  Doctor  Franklin  recognized  the  Professor,  and  by  unanimous  approval  he <br/>was  invited  to  become  an  active  member  of  the  committee.  During  the  proceedings  which  followed, <br/>the  Professor  was  treated  with  the  most  profound  respect  and  all  of  his  suggestions  immediately  acted <br/>upon.  He  submitted  a  pattern  which  he  considered  symbolically  appropriate  for  the  new  flag,  and  this <br/>was  unhesitatingly  accepted  by  the  other  six  members  of  the  committee,  who  voted  that  the <br/>arrangement  suggested  by  the  Professor  be  forthwith  adopted.  After  the  episode  of  the  flag  the <br/>Professor  quietly  vanished,  and  nothing  further  is  known  concerning  him. <br/><br/>Did  General  Washington  and  Doctor  Franklin  recognize  the  Professor  as  an  emissary  of  the  Mystery <br/>school  which  has  so  long  controlled  the  political  destinies  of  this  planet?  Benjamin  Franklin  was  a <br/>philosopher  and  a  Freemason&#x2014; possibly  a  Rosicrucian  initiate.  He  and  the  Marquis  de  Lafayette&#x2014; also <br/>a  man  of  mystery&#x2014; constitute  two  of  the  most  important  links  in  the  chain  of  circumstance  that <br/>culminated  in  the  establishment  of  the  original  thirteen  American  Colonies  as  a  free  and  independent <br/>nation.  Doctor  Franklin's  philosophic  attainments  are  well  attested  in  Poor  Richard's  Almanac, <br/>published  by  him  for  many  years  under  the  name  of  Richard  Saunders.  His  interest  in  the  cause  of <br/>Freemasonry  is  also  shown  by  his  republication  of  Anderson's  Constitutions  of  Freemasonry,  a  rare <br/>and  much  disputed  work  on  the  subject. <br/><br/>It  was  during  the  evening  of  July  4, 1776,  that  the  second  of  these  mysterious  episodes  occurred.  In <br/>the  old  State  House  in  Philadelphia  a  group  of  men  were  gathered  for  the  momentous  task  of  severing <br/>the  last  tie  between  the  old  country  and  the  new.  It  was  a  grave  moment  and  not  a  few  of  those <br/>present  feared  that  their  lives  would  be  the  forfeit  for  their  audacity.  In  the  midst  of  the  debate  a <br/><br/><br/>fierce  voice  rang  out.  The  debaters  stopped  and  turned  to  look  upon  the  stranger.  Who  was  this  man <br/><br/>who  had  suddenly  appeared  in  their  midst  and  transfixed  them  with  his  oratory?  They  had  never  seen <br/>him  before,  none  knew  when  he  had  entered,  but  his  tall  form  and  pale  face  filled  them  with  awe.  His <br/>voice  ringing  with  a  holy  zeal,  the  stranger  stirred  them  to  their  very  souls.  His  closing  words  rang <br/>through  the  building:  &quot;God  has  given  America  to  be  freel&quot;  As  the  stranger  sank  into  a  chair  exhausted, <br/>a  wild  enthusiasm  burst  forth.  Name  after  name  was  placed  upon  the  parchment:  the  Declaration  of <br/>Independence  was  signed.  But  where  was  the  man  who  had  precipitated  the  accomplishment  of  this <br/>immortal  task&#x2014;who  had  lifted  for  a  moment  the  veil  from  the  eyes  of  the  assemblage  and  revealed  to <br/>them  a  part  at  least  of  the  great  purpose  for  which  the  new  nation  was  conceived?  He  had  disappeared, <br/>nor  was  he  ever  seen  again  or  his  identity  established.  This  episode  parallels  others  of  a  similar  kind <br/>recorded  by  ancient  historians  attendant  upon  the  founding  of  every  new  nation.  Are  they <br/>coincidences,  or  do  they  demonstrate  that  the  divine  wisdom  of  the  ancient  Mysteries  still  is  present <br/>in  the  world,  serving  mankind  as  it  did  of  old? <br/><br/><br/>p.  201 <br/><br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>PHILIP,  King  of  Macedon,  ambitious  to  obtain  the  teacher  who  would  be  most  capable  of  imparting <br/>the  higher  branches  of  learning  to  his  fourteen-year-old  son,  Alexander,  and  wishing  the  prince  to <br/>have  for  his  mentor  the  most  famous  and  learned  of  the  great  philosophers,  decided  to  communicate <br/>with  Aristotle.  He  dispatched  the  following  letter  to  the  Greek  sage:  &quot;PHILIP  TO  ARISTOTLE, <br/>HEALTH:  Know  that  I  have  a  son.  I  render  the  gods  many  thanks;  not  so  much  for  his  birth,  as  that <br/>he  was  born  in  your  time,  for  I  hope  that  being  educated  and  instructed  by  you,  he  will  become <br/>worthy  of  us  both  and  the  kingdom  which  he  shall  inherit.&quot;  Accepting  Philip's  invitation,  Aristotle <br/>journeyed  to  Macedon  in  the  fourth  year  of  the  108th  Olympiad,  and  remained  for  eight  years  as  the <br/>tutor  of  Alexander.  The  young  prince's  affection  for  his  instructor  became  as  great  as  that  which  he <br/>felt  for  his  father.  He  said  that  his  father  had  given  him  being,  but  that  Aristotle  had  given  him  well- <br/>being. <br/><br/>The  basic  principles  of  the  Ancient  Wisdom  were  imparted  to  Alexander  the  Great  by  Aristotle,  and  at <br/>the  philosopher's  feet  the  Macedonian  youth  came  to  realize  the  transcendency  of  Greek  learning  as  it <br/>was  personified  in  Plato's  immortal  disciple.  Elevated  by  his  illumined  teacher  to  the  threshold  of  the <br/>philosophic  sphere,  he  beheld  the  world  of  the  sages&#x2014;the  world  that  fate  and  the  limitations  of  his <br/>own  soul  decreed  he  should  not  conquer. <br/><br/>Aristotle  in  his  leisure  hours  edited  and  annotated  the  Iliad  of  Horner  and  presented  the  finished <br/>volume  to  Alexander.  This  book  the  young  conqueror  so  highly  prized  that  he  carried  it  with  him  on <br/>all  his  campaigns.  At  the  time  of  his  triumph  over  Darius,  discovering  among  the  spoils  a  magnificent, <br/>gem-studded  casket  of  unguents,  he  dumped  its  contents  upon  the  ground,  declaring  that  at  last  he <br/>had  found  a  case  worthy  of  Aristotle's  edition  of  the  Iliadl <br/><br/>While  on  his  Asiatic  campaign,  Alexander  learned  that  Aristotle  had  published  one  of  his  most  prized <br/>discourses,  an  occurrence  which  deeply  grieved  the  young  king.  So  to  Aristotle,  Conqueror  of  the <br/>Unknown,  Alexander,  Conqueror  of  the  Known,  sent  this  reproachful  and  pathetic  and  admission  of <br/>the  insufficiency  of  worldly  pomp  and  power:  &quot;ALEXANDER  TO  ARISTOTLE,  HEALTH:  You  were <br/>wrong  in  publishing  those  branches  of  science  hitherto  not  to  be  acquired  except  from  oral  instruction. <br/>In  what  shall  I  excel  others  if  the  more  profound  knowledge  I  gained  from  you  be  communicated  to  all? <br/>For  my  part  I  had  rather  surpass  the  majority  of  mankind  in  the  sublimer  branches  of  learning, <br/>than  in  extent  of  power  and  dominion.  Farewell.&quot;  The  receipt  of  this  amazing  letter  caused  no  ripple <br/>in  the  placid  life  of  Aristotle,  who  replied  that  although  the  discourse  had  been  communicated  to  the <br/>multitudes,  none  who  had  not  heard  him  deliver  the  lecture  (who  lacked  spiritual  comprehension) <br/>could  understand  its  true  import. <br/><br/>A  few  short  years  and  Alexander  the  Great  went  the  way  of  all  flesh,  and  with  his  body  crumbled  the <br/>structure  of  empire  erected  upon  his  personality.  One  year  later  Aristotle  also  passed  into  that  greater <br/>world  concerning  whose  mysteries  he  had  so  often  discoursed  with  his  disciples  in  the  Lyceum.  But, <br/>as  Aristotle  excelled  Alexander  in  life,  so  he  excelled  him  in  death;  for  though  his  body  moldered  in  an <br/>obscure  tomb,  the  great  philosopher  continued  to  live  in  his  intellectual  achievements.  Age  after  age <br/>paid  him  grateful  tribute,  generation  after  generation  pondered  over  his  theorems  until  by  the  sheer <br/>transcendency  of  his  rational  faculties  Aristotle&#x2014; &quot;the  master  of  those  who  know,&quot;  as  Dante  has  called <br/>him&#x2014; became  the  actual  conqueror  of  the  very  world  which  Alexander  had  sought  to  subdue  with  the <br/>sword. <br/><br/>Thus  it  is  demonstrated  that  to  capture  a  man  it  is  not  sufficient  to  enslave  his  body&#x2014; it  is  necessary  to <br/>enlist  his  reason;  that  to  free  a  man  it  is  not  enough  to  strike  the  shackles  from  his  limbs&#x2014; his  mind <br/><br/><br/>must  be  liberated  from  bondage  to  his  own  ignorance.  Physical  conquest  must  ever  fail,  for, <br/>generating  hatred  and  dissension,  it  spurs  the  mind  to  the  avenging  of  an  outraged  body;  but  all  men <br/>are  bound  whether  willingly  or  unwillingly  to  obey  that  intellect  in  which  they  recognize  qualities  and <br/>virtues  superior  to  their  own. <br/><br/>That  the  philosophic  culture  of  ancient  Greece,  Egypt,  and  India  excelled  that  of  the  modern,  world <br/>must  be  admitted  by  all,  even  by  the  most  confirmed  of  modernists.  The  golden  era  of  Greek  aesthetics, <br/>intellectualism,  and  ethics  has  never  since  been  equaled.  The  true  philosopher  belongs  to  the  most <br/>noble  order  of  men:  the  nation  or  race  which  is  blessed  by  possession  of  illumined  thinkers  is <br/>fortunate  indeed,  and  its  name  shall  be  remembered  for  their  sake.  In  the  famous  Pythagorean  school <br/>at  Crotona,  philosophy  was  regarded  as  indispensable  to  the  life  of  man.  He  who  did  not  comprehend <br/>the  dignity  of  the  reasoning  power  could  not  properly  be  said  to  live.  Therefore,  when  through  innate <br/>perverseness  a  member  either  voluntarily  withdrew  or  was  forcibly  ejected  from  the  philosophic <br/>fraternity,  a  headstone  was  set  up  for  him  in  the  community  graveyard;  for  he  who  had  forsaken <br/>intellectual  and  ethical  pursuits  to  reenter  the  material  sphere  with  its  illusions  of  sense  and  false <br/>ambition  was  regarded  as  one  dead  to  the  sphere  of  Reality.  The  life  represented  by  the  thraldom  of <br/>the  senses  the  Pj^hagoreans  conceived  to  be  spiritual  death,  while  they  regarded  death  to  the  sense- <br/>world  as  spiritual  life. <br/><br/>Philosophy  bestows  life  in  that  it  reveals  the  dignity  and  purpose  of  living.  Materiality  bestows  death <br/>in  that  it  benumbs  or  clouds  those  faculties  of  the  human  soul  which  should  be  responsive  to  the <br/>enlivening  impulses  of  creative  thought  and  ennobling  virtue.  How  inferior  to  these  standards  of <br/>remote  days  are  the  laws  by  which  men  live  in  the  twentieth  century!  Today  man,  a  sublime  creature <br/>with  infinite  capacity  for  self-improvement,  in  an  effort  to  be  true  to  false  standards,  turns  from  his <br/>birthright  of  understanding&#x2014;without  realizing  the  consequences&#x2014;and  plunges  into  the  maelstrom  of <br/>material  illusion.  The  precious  span  of  his  earthly  years  he  devotes  to  the  pathetically  futile  effort  to <br/>establish  himself  as  an  enduring  power  in  a  realm  of  unenduring  things.  Gradually  the  memory  of  his <br/>life  as  a  spiritual  being  vanishes  from  his  objective  mind  and  he  focuses  all  his  partly  awakened <br/>faculties  upon <br/><br/><br/>JOHN  AND  THE  VISION  OF  THE  APOCALYPSE. <br/><br/><br/>From  an  engraving  by  Jean  Duvet. <br/><br/><br/>Jean  Duvet  of  Langres  (who  was  born  in  1485  and  presumably  died  sometime  after  1561,  the  year  in  which  his <br/>illustrations  to  the  Apocalypse  were  printed  in  book  form)  was  the  oldest  and  greatest  of  French  Renaissance  engravers. <br/>Little  is  known  concerning  Duvet  beyond  the  fact  that  he  was  the  goldsmith  to  the  King  of  France.  His  engravings  for  the <br/>Book  of  Revelation,  executed  after  he  had  passed  his  seventieth  year,  were  his  masterpiece.  (For  further  information <br/>regarding  this  obscure  master,  consult  article  by  William  M.  Ivins,  Jr.,  in  The  Arts,  May,  1926.)  The  face  of  John  is  an <br/>actual  portrait  of  Duvet.  This  plate,  like  many  others  cut  by  Duvet,  is  rich  in  philosophical  symbolism. <br/><br/>p.  202 <br/><br/>the  seething  beehive  of  industry  which  he  has  come  to  consider  the  sole  actuahty.  From  the  lofty <br/>heights  of  his  Selfhood  he  slowly  sinks  into  the  gloomy  depths  of  ephemerality.  He  falls  to  the  level  of <br/>the  beast,  and  in  brutish  fashion  mumbles  the  problems  arising  from  his  all  too  insufficient <br/>knowledge  of  the  Divine  Plan.  Here  in  the  lurid  turmoil  of  a  great  industrial,  political,  commercial <br/>inferno,  men  writhe  in  self-inflicted  agony  and,  reaching  out  into  the  swirling  mists,  strive  to  clutch <br/>and  hold  the  grotesque  phantoms  of  success  and  power. <br/><br/>Ignorant  of  the  cause  of  life,  ignorant  of  the  purpose  of  life,  ignorant  of  what  lies  beyond  the  mystery <br/>of  death,  yet  possessing  within  himself  the  answer  to  it  all,  man  is  willing  to  sacrifice  the  beautiful,  the <br/>true,  and  the  good  within  and  without  upon  the  blood-stained  altar  of  worldly  ambition.  The  world  of <br/>philosophy&#x2014;that  beautiful  garden  of  thought  wherein  the  sages  dwell  in  the  bond  of  fraternity&#x2014;fades <br/>from  view.  In  its  place  rises  an  empire  of  stone,  steel,  smoke,  and  hate-a  world  in  which  millions  of <br/>creatures  potentially  human  scurry  to  and  fro  in  the  desperate  effort  to  exist  and  at  the  same  time <br/>maintain  the  vast  institution  which  they  have  erected  and  which,  like  some  mighty,  juggernaut,  is <br/>rumbling  inevitably  towards  an  unknown  end.  In  this  physical  empire,  which  man  erects  in  the  vain <br/>belief  that  he  can  outshine  the  kingdom  of  the  celestials,  everything  is  changed  to  stone.  Fascinated <br/>by  the  glitter  of  gain,  man  gazes  at  the  Medusa-like  face  of  greed  and  stands  petrified. <br/><br/>In  this  commercial  age  science  is  concerned  solely  with  the  classification  of  physical  knowledge  and <br/>investigation  of  the  temporal  and  illusionary  parts  of  Nature.  Its  so-called  practical  discoveries  bind <br/>man  but  more  tightly  with  the  bonds  of  physical  limitation.  Religion,  too,  has  become  materialistic: <br/>the  beauty  and  dignity  of  faith  is  measured  by  huge  piles  of  masonry,  by  tracts  of  real  estate,  or  by  the <br/>balance  sheet.  Philosophy  which  connects  heaven  and  earth  like  a  mighty  ladder,  up  the  rungs  of <br/>which  the  illumined  of  all  ages  have  climbed  into  the  living  presence  of  Reality&#x2014; even  philosophy  has <br/>become  a  prosaic  and  heterogeneous  mass  of  conflicting  notions.  Its  beauty,  its  dignity,  its <br/>transcendency  are  no  more.  Like  other  branches  of  human  thought,  it  has  been  made  materialistic&#x2014; <br/>&quot;practical&quot;&#x2014; and  its  activities  so  directionalized  that  they  may  also  contribute  their  part  to  the  erection <br/>of  this  modern  world  of  stone  and  steel. <br/><br/>In  the  ranks  of  the  so-called  learned  there  is  rising  up  a  new  order  of  thinkers,  which  may  best  be <br/>termed  the  School  of  the  Worldly  Wise  Men.  After  arriving  at  the  astounding  conclusion  that  they  are <br/>the  intellectual  salt  of  the  earth,  these  gentlemen  of  letters  have  appointed  themselves  the  final  judges <br/>of  all  knowledge,  both  human  and  divine.  This  group  affirms  that  all  mystics  must  have  been  epileptic <br/>and  most  of  the  saints  neurotic!  It  declares  God  to  be  a  fabrication  of  primitive  superstition;  the <br/>universe  to  be  intended  for  no  particular  purpose;  immortality  to  be  a  figment  of  the  imagination;  and <br/>an  outstanding  individuality  to  be  but  a  fortuitous  combination  of  cells!  Pythagoras  is  asserted  to <br/>have  suffered  from  a  &quot;bean  complex&quot;;  Socrates  was  a  notorious  inebriate;  St.  Paul  was  subject  to  fits; <br/>Paracelsus  was  an  infamous  quack,  the  Comte  di  Cagliostro  a  mountebank,  and  the  Comte  de  St.- <br/>Germain  the  outstanding  crook  of  history! <br/><br/>What  do  the  lofty  concepts  of  the  world's  illumined  saviors  and  sages  have  in  common  with  these <br/>stunted,  distorted  products  of  the  &quot;realism&quot;  of  this  century?  All  over  the  world  men  and  women <br/>ground  down  by  the  soulless  cultural  systems  of  today  are  crying  out  for  the  return  of  the  banished <br/>age  of  beauty  and  enlightenment&#x2014; for  something  pracficaZ  in  the  highest  sense  of  the  word.  A  few  are <br/>beginning  to  realize  that  so-called  civilization  in  its  present  form  is  at  the  vanishing  point;  that <br/><br/><br/>coldness,  heartlessness,  commercialism,  and  material  efficienqr  are  impractical,  and  only  that  which <br/>offers  opportunity  for  the  expression  of  love  and  ideality  is  truly  worth  while.  All  the  world  is  seeking <br/>happiness,  but  knows  not  in  what  direction  to  search.  Men  must  learn  that  happiness  crowns  the <br/>soul's  quest  for  understanding.  Only  through  the  realization  of  infinite  goodness  and  infinite <br/>accomplishment  can  the  peace  of  the  inner  Self  be  assured.  In  spite  of  man's  geocentricism,  there  is <br/>something  in  the  human  mind  that  is  reaching  out  to  philosophy&#x2014;not  to  this  or  that  philosophic  code, <br/>but  simply  to  philosophy  in  the  broadest  and  fullest  sense. <br/><br/>The  great  philosophic  institutions  of  the  past  must  rise  again,  for  these  alone  can  tend  the  veil  which <br/>divides  the  world  of  causes  from  that  of  effects.  Only  the  Mysteries&#x2014;those  sacred  Colleges  of  Wisdom- <br/>-can  reveal  to  struggling  humanity  that  greater  and  more  glorious  universe  which  is  the  true  home  of <br/>the  spiritual  being  called  man.  Modern  philosophy  has  failed  in  that  it  has  come  to  regard  thinking  as <br/>simply  an  intellectual  process.  Materialistic  thought  is  as  hopeless  a  code  of  life  as  commercialism <br/>itself.  The  power  to  think  true  is  the  savior  of  humanity.  The  mythological  and  historical  Redeemers <br/>of  every  age  were  all  personifications  of  that  power.  He  who  has  a  little  more  rationality  than  his <br/>neighbor  is  a  little  better  than  his  neighbor.  He  who  functions  on  a  higher  plane  of  rationality  than <br/>the  rest  of  the  world  is  termed  the  greatest  thinker.  He  who  functions  on  a  lower  plane  is  regarded  as <br/>a  barbarian.  Thus  comparative  rational  development  is  the  true  gauge  of  the  individual's  evolutionary <br/>status. <br/><br/>Briefly  stated,  the  true  purpose  of  ancient  philosophy  was  to  discover  a  method  whereby  development <br/>of  the  rational  nature  could  be  accelerated  instead  of  awaiting  the  slower  processes  of  Nature,  This <br/>supreme  source  of  power,  this  attainment  of  knowledge,  this  unfolding  of  the  god  within,  is  concealed <br/>under  the  epigrammatic  statement  of  the  philosophic  life.  This  was  the  key  to  the  Great  Work,  the <br/>mystery  of  the  Philosopher's  Stone,  for  it  meant  that  alchemical  transmutation  had  been <br/>accomplished.  Thus  ancient  philosophy  was  primarily  the  living  of  a  life;  secondarily,  an  intellectual <br/>method.  He  alone  can  become  a  philosopher  in  the  highest  sense  who  lives  the  philosophic  life.  What <br/>man  lives  he  comes  to  know.  Consequently,  a  great  philosopher  is  one  whose  threefold  life&#x2014;physical, <br/>mental,  and  spiritual&#x2014; is  wholly  devoted  to  and  completely  permeated  by  his  rationality. <br/><br/>Man's  physical,  emotional,  and  mental  natures  provide  environments  of  reciprocal  benefit  or <br/>detriment  to  each  other.  Since  the  physical  nature  is  the  immediate  environment  of  the  mental,  only <br/>that  mind  is  capable  of  rational  thinking  which  is  enthroned  in  a  harmonious  and  highly  refined <br/>material  constitution.  Hence  right  action,  right  feeling,  and  right  thinking  are  prerequisites  of  right <br/>knowing,  and  the  attainment  of  philosophic  power  is  possible  only  to  such  as  have  harmonized  their <br/>thinking  with  their  living.  The  wise  have  therefore  declared  that  none  can  attain  to  the  highest  in  the <br/>science  of  knowing  until  first  he  has  attained  to  the  highest  in  the  science  of  living.  Philosophic  power <br/>is  the  natural  outgrowth  of  the  philosophic  life.  Just  as  an  intense  physical  existence  emphasizes  the <br/>importance  of  physical  things,  or  just  as  the  monastic  metaphysical  asceticism  establishes  the <br/>desirability  of  the  ecstatic  state,  so  complete  philosophic  absorption  ushers  the  consciousness  of  the <br/>thinker  into  the  most  elevated  and  noble  of  all  spheres&#x2014; the  pure  philosophic,  or  rational,  world. <br/><br/>In  a  civilization  primarily  concerned  with  the  accomplishment  of  the  extremes  of  temporal  activity, <br/>the  philosopher  represents  an  equilibrating  intellect  capable  of  estimating  and  guiding  the  cultural <br/>growth.  The  establishment  of  the  philosophic  rhythm  in  the  nature  of  an  individual  ordinarily <br/>requires  from  fifteen  to  twenty  years.  During  that  entire  period  the  disciples  of  old  were  constantly <br/>subjected  to  the  most  severe  discipline.  Every  activity  of  life  was  gradually  disengaged  from  other <br/>interests  and  focalized  upon  the  reasoning  part.  In  the  ancient  world  there  was  another  and  most  vital <br/>factor  which  entered  into  the  production  of  rational  intellects  and  which  is  entirely  beyond  the <br/>comprehension  of  modem  thinkers:  namely,  initiation  into  the  philosophic  Mysteries.  A  man  who <br/>had  demonstrated  his  peculiar  mental  and  spiritual  fitness  was  accepted  into  the  body  of  the  learned <br/>and  to  him  was  revealed  that  priceless  heritage  of  arcane  lore  preserved  from  generation  to <br/>generation.  This  heritage  of  philosophic  truth  is  the  matchless  treasure  of  all  ages,  and  each  disciple <br/><br/><br/>admitted  into  these  brotherhoods  of  the  wise  made,  in  turn,  his  individual  contribution  to  this  store <br/>of  classified  knowledge. <br/><br/>The  one  hope  of  the  world  is  philosophy,  for  all  the  sorrows  of  modern  life  result  from  the  lack  of  a <br/>proper  philosophic  code.  Those  who  sense  even  in  part  the  dignity  of  life  cannot  but  realize  the <br/>shallowness  apparent  in  the  activities  of  this  age.  Well  has  it  been  said  that  no  individual  can  succeed <br/>until  he  has  developed  his  philosophy  of  life.  Neither  can  a  race  or  nation  attain  true  greatness  until  it <br/>has  formulated  an  adequate  philosophy  and  has  dedicated  its  existence  to  a  policy  consistent  with <br/>that  philosophy.  During  the  World  War,  when  so-called  civilization  hurled  one  half  of  itself  against <br/>the  other  in  a  frenzy  of  hate,  men  ruthlessly  destroyed  something  more  precious  even  than  human  life: <br/>they  obliterated  those  records  of  human  thought  by  which  life  can  be  intelligently  directionalized. <br/>Truly  did  Mohammed  declare  the  ink  of  philosophers  to  be  more  precious  than  the  blood  of  martyrs. <br/>Priceless  documents,  invaluable  records  of  achievement,  knowledge  founded  on  ages  of  patient <br/>observation  and  experimentation  by  the  elect  of  the  earth&#x2014;all  were  destroyed  with  scarcely  a  qualm  of <br/>regret.  What  was  knowledge,  what  was  truth,  beauty,  love,  idealism,  philosophy,  or  religion  when <br/>compared  to  man's  desire  to  control  an  infinitesimal  spot  in  the  fields  of  Cosmos  for  an  inestimably <br/>minute  fragment  of  time?  Merely  to  satisfy  some  whim  or  urge  of  ambition  man  would  uproot  the <br/>universe,  though  well  he  knows  that  in  a  few  short  years  he  must  depart,  leaving  all  that  he  has  seized <br/>to  posterity  as  an  old  cause  for  fresh  contention. <br/><br/>War&#x2014;the  irrefutable  evidence  of  irrationality&#x2014; still  smolders  in  the  hearts  of  men;  it  cannot  die  until <br/>human  selfishness  is  overcome.  Armed  with  multifarious  inventions  and  destructive  agencies, <br/>civilization  will  continue  its  fratricidal  strife  through  future  ages,  But  upon  the  mind  of  man  there  is <br/>dawning  a  great  fear&#x2014; the  fear  that <br/><br/>p.  203 <br/><br/><br/>THE  ENTRANCE  TO  THE  HOUSE  OF  THE  MYSTERIES. <br/><br/><br/>From  Khunrath's  Amphitheatrum  Sapientiae,  etc. <br/><br/><br/>This  symbolic  figure,  representing  the  way  to  everlasting  life,  is  described  by  Khunrath  in  substance  as  follows:  &quot;This  is <br/>the  Portal  of  the  amphitheatre  of  the  only  true  and  eternal  Wisdom&#x2014;a  narrow  one,  indeed,  but  sufficiently  august,  and <br/>consecrated  to  Jehovah.  To  this  portal  ascent  is  made  by  a  mystic,  indisputably  prologetic,  flight  of  steps,  set  before  it  as <br/>shown  in  the  picture.  It  consists  of  seven  theosophic,  or,  rather,  philosophic  steps  of  the  Doctrine  of  the  Faithful  Sons. <br/>After  ascending  the  steps,  the  path  is  along  the  way  of  God  the  Father,  either  directly  by  inspiration  or  by  various  mediate <br/>means.  According  to  the  seven  oracular  laws  shining  at  the  portal,  those  who  are  inspired  divinely  have  the  power  to  enter <br/>and  with  the  eyes  of  the  body  and  of  the  mind,  of  seeing,  contemplating  and  investigating  in  a  Christiano-Kabalistic, <br/>divino-magical,  physico-chemical  manner,  the  nature  of  the  Wisdom:  Goodness,  and  Power  of  the  Creator;  to  the  end  that <br/>they  die  not  sophistically  but  live  theosophically,  and  that  the  orthodox  philosophers  so  created  may  with  sincere <br/>philosophy  expound  the  works  of  the  Lord,  and  worthily  praise  God  who  has  thus  blessed  these  friend,  of  God.&quot;  The  above <br/>figure  and  description  constitute  one  of  the  most  remarkable  expositions  ever  made  of  the  appearance  of  the  Wise  Man's <br/>House  and  the  way  by  which  it  must  be  entered. <br/><br/><br/>eventually  civilization  will  destroy  itself  in  one  great  cataclysmic  struggle.  Then  must  be  reenacted  the <br/>eternal  drama  of  reconstruction.  Out  of  the  ruins  of  the  civilization  which  died  when  its  idealism  died, <br/>some  primitive  people  yet  in  the  womb  of  destiny  must  build  a  new  world.  Foreseeing  the  needs  of <br/>that  day,  the  philosophers  of  the  ages  have  desired  that  into  the  structure  of  this  new  world  shall  be <br/>incorporated  the  truest  and  finest  of  all  that  has  gone  before.  It  is  a  divine  law  that  the  sum  of <br/>previous  accomplishment  shall  be  the  foundation  of  each  new  order  of  things.  The  great  philosophic <br/>treasures  of  humanity  must  be  preserved.  That  which  is  superficial  may  he  allowed  to  perish;  that <br/>which  is  fundamental  and  essential  must  remain,  regardless  of  cost. <br/><br/>Two  fundamental  forms  of  ignorance  were  recognized  by  the  Platonists:  simple  ignorance  and <br/>complex  ignorance.  Simple  ignorance  is  merely  lack  of  knowledge  and  is  common  to  all  creatures <br/>existing  posterior  to  the  First  Cause,  which  alone  has  perfection  of  knowledge.  Simple  ignorance  is  an <br/>ever-active  agent,  urging  the  soul  onward  to  the  acquisition  of  knowledge.  From  this  virginal  state  of <br/>unawareness  grows  the  desire  to  become  aware  with  its  resultant  improvement  in  the  mental <br/>condition.  The  human  intellect  is  ever  surrounded  by  forms  of  existence  beyond  the  estimation  of  its <br/>partly  developed  faculties.  In  this  realm  of  objects  not  understood  is  a  never-failing  source  of  mental <br/>stimuli.  Thus  wisdom  eventually  results  from  the  effort  to  cope  rationally  with  the  problem  of  the <br/>unknown. <br/><br/>In  the  last  analysis,  the  Ultimate  Cause  alone  can  be  denominated  wise;  in  simpler  words,  only  God  is <br/>good.  Socrates  declared  knowledge,  virtue,  and  utility  to  be  one  with  the  innate  nature  of  good. <br/>Knowledge  is  a  condition  of  knowing;  virtue  a  condition  of  being;  utility  a  condition  of  doing. <br/>Considering  wisdom  as  synonymous  with  mental  completeness,  it  is  evident  that  such  a  state  can <br/>exist  only  in  the  Whole,  for  that  which  is  less  than  the  Whole  cannot  possess  the  fullness  of  the  All.  No <br/>part  of  creation  is  complete;  hence  each  part  is  imperfect  to  the  extent  that  it  falls  short  of  entirety. <br/>Where  incompleteness  is,  it  also  follows  that  ignorance  must  be  coexistent;  for  every  part,  while <br/>capable  of  knowing  its  own  Self,  cannot  become  aware  of  the  Self  in  the  other  parts.  Philosophically <br/>considered,  growth  from  the  standpoint  of  human  evolution  is  a  process  proceeding  from <br/>heterogeneity  to  homogeneity.  In  time,  therefore,  the  isolated  consciousness  of  the  individual <br/>fragments  is  reunited  to  become  the  complete  consciousness  of  the  Whole.  Then,  and  then  only,  is  the <br/>condition  of  all-knowing  an  absolute  reality. <br/><br/>Thus  all  creatures  are  relatively  ignorant  yet  relatively  wise;  comparatively  nothing  yet  comparatively <br/>all.  The  microscope  reveals  to  man  his  significance;  the  telescope,  his  insignificance.  Through  the <br/>eternities  of  existence  man  is  gradually  increasing  in  both  wisdom  and  understanding;  his  ever- <br/>expanding  consciousness  is  including  more  of  the  external  within  the  area  of  itself.  Even  in  man's <br/>present  state  of  imperfection  it  is  dawning  upon  his  realization  that  he  can  never  be  truly  happy  until <br/>he  is  perfect,  and  that  of  all  the  faculties  contributing  to  his  self-perfection  none  is  equal  in <br/>importance  to  the  rational  intellect.  Through  the  labyrinth  of  diversity  only  the  illumined  mind  can, <br/>and  must,  lead  the  soul  into  the  perfect  light  of  unity. <br/><br/><br/>In  addition  to  the  simple  ignorance  which  is  the  most  potent  factor  in  mental  growth  there  exists <br/>another,  which  is  of  a  far  more  dangerous  and  subtle  type.  This  second  form,  called  twofold  or <br/>complex  ignorance,  may  be  briefly  defined  as  ignorance  of  ignorance.  Worshiping  the  sun,  moon, <br/>and  stars,  and  offering  sacrifices  to  the  winds,  the  primitive  savage  sought  with  crude  fetishes  to <br/>propitiate  his  unknown  gods.  He  dwelt  in  a  world  filled  with  wonders  which  he  did  not  understand. <br/>Now  great  cities  stand  where  once  roamed  the  Crookboned  men.  Humanity  no  longer  regards  itself  as <br/>primitive  or  aboriginal.  The  spirit  of  wonder  and  awe  has  been  succeeded  by  one  of  sophistication. <br/>Today  man  worships  his  own  accomplishments,  and  either  relegates  the  immensities  of  time  and <br/>space  to  the  background  of  his  consciousness  or  disregards  them  entirely. <br/><br/>The  twentieth  century  makes  a  fetish  of  civilization  and  is  overwhelmed  by  its  own  fabrications;  its <br/>gods  are  of  its  own  fashioning.  Humanity  has  forgotten  how  infinitesimal,  how  impermanent  and  how <br/>ignorant  it  actually  is.  Ptolemy  has  been  ridiculed  for  conceiving  the  earth  to  be  the  center  of  the <br/>universe,  yet  modem  civilization  is  seemingly  founded  upon  the  hypothesis  that  the  planet  earth  is <br/>the  most  permanent  and  important  of  all  the  heavenly  spheres, <br/><br/>p.  204 <br/><br/>and  that  the  gods  from  their  starry  thrones  are  fascinated  by  the  monumental  and  epochal  events <br/>taking  place  upon  this  spherical  ant-hill  in  Chaos. <br/><br/>From  age  to  age  men  ceaselessly  toil  to  build  cities  that  they  may  rule  over  them  with  pomp  and <br/>power&#x2014;as  though  a  fillet  of  gold  or  ten  million  vassals  could  elevate  man  above  the  dignity  of  his  own <br/>thoughts  and  make  the  glitter  of  his  scepter  visible  to  the  distant  stars.  As  this  tiny  planet  rolls  along <br/>its  orbit  in  space,  it  carries  with  it  some  two  billion  human  beings  who  live  and  die  oblivious  to  that <br/>immeasurable  existence  lying  beyond  the  lump  on  which  they  dwell.  Measured  by  the  infinities  of <br/>time  and  space,  what  are  the  captains  of  industry  or  the  lords  of  finance?  If  one  of  these  plutocrats <br/>should  rise  until  he  ruled  the  earth  itself,  what  would  he  be  but  a  petty  despot  seated  on  a  grain  of <br/>Cosmic  dust? <br/><br/>Philosophy  reveals  to  man  his  kinship  with  the  All.  It  shows  him  that  he  is  a  brother  to  the  suns  which <br/>dot  the  firmament;  it  lifts  him  from  a  taxpayer  on  a  whirling  atom  to  a  citizen  of  Cosmos.  It  teaches <br/>him  that  while  physically  bound  to  earth  (of  which  his  blood  and  bones  are  part),  there  is  nevertheless <br/>within  him  a  spiritual  power,  a  diviner  Self,  through  which  he  is  one  with  the  symphony  of  the  Whole. <br/>Ignorance  of  ignorance,  then,  is  that  self-satisfied  state  of  unawareness  in  which  man,  knowing <br/>nothing  outside  the  limited  area  of  his  physical  senses,  bumptiously  declares  there  is  nothing  more  to <br/>know!  He  who  knows  no  life  save  the  physical  is  merely  ignorant;  but  he  who  declares  physical  life  to <br/>be  all-important  and  elevates  it  to  the  position  of  supreme  reality&#x2014;such  a  one  is  ignorant  of  his  own <br/>ignorance. <br/><br/>If  the  Infinite  had  not  desired  man  to  become  wise.  He  would  not  have  bestowed  upon  him  the  faculty <br/>of  knowing.  If  He  had  not  intended  man  to  become  virtuous.  He  would  not  have  sown  within  the <br/>human  heart  the  seeds  of  virtue.  If  He  had  predestined  man  to  be  limited  to  his  narrow  physical  life. <br/>He  would  not  have  equipped  him  with  perceptions  and  sensibilities  capable  of  grasping,  in  part  at <br/>least,  the  immensity  of  the  outer  universe.  The  criers  of  philosophy  call  all  men  to  a  comradeship  of <br/>the  spirit:  to  a  fraternity  of  thought:  to  a  convocation  of  Selves.  Philosophy  invites  man  out  of  the <br/>vainness  of  selfishness;  out  of  the  sorrow  of  ignorance  and  the  despair  of  worldliness;  out  of  the <br/>travesty  of  ambition  and  the  cruel  clutches  of  greed;  out  of  the  red  hell  of  hate  and  the  cold  tomb  of <br/>dead  idealism. <br/><br/>Philosophy  would  lead  all  men  into  the  broad,  calm  vistas  of  truth,  for  the  world  of  philosophy  is  a <br/>land  of  peace  where  those  finer  qualities  pent  up  within  each  human  soul  are  given  opportunity  for <br/>expression.  Here  men  are  taught  the  wonders  of  the  blades  of  grass;  each  stick  and  stone  is  endowed <br/><br/><br/>with  speech  and  tells  the  secret  of  its  being.  All  life,  bathed  in  the  radiance  of  understanding,  becomes <br/>a  wonderful  and  beautiful  reality.  From  the  four  corners  of  creation  swells  a  mighty  anthem  of <br/>rejoicing,  for  here  in  the  light  of  philosophy  is  revealed  the  purpose  of  existence;  the  wisdom  and <br/>goodness  permeating  the  Whole  become  evident  to  even  man's  imperfect  intellect.  Here  the  yearning <br/>heart  of  humanity  finds  that  companionship  which  draws  forth  from  the  innermost  recesses  of  the <br/>soul  that  great  store  of  good  which  lies  there  like  precious  metal  in  some  deep  hidden  vein. <br/><br/>Following  the  path  pointed  out  by  the  wise,  the  seeker  after  truth  ultimately  attains  to  the  summit  of <br/>wisdom's  mount,  and  gazing  down,  beholds  the  panorama  of  life  spread  out  before  him.  The  cities  of <br/>the  plains  are  but  tiny  specks  and  the  horizon  on  every  hand  is  obscured  by  the  gray  haze  of  the <br/>Unknown.  Then  the  soul  realizes  that  wisdom  lies  in  breadth  of  vision;  that  it  increases  in  comparison <br/>to  the  vista.  Then  as  man's  thoughts  lift  him  heavenward,  streets  are  lost  in  cities,  cities  in  nations, <br/>nations  in  continents,  continents  in  the  earth,  the  earth  in  space,  and  space  in  an  infinite  eternity, <br/>until  at  last  but  two  things  remain:  the  Self  and  the  goodness  of  God. <br/><br/>While  man's  physical  body  resides  with  him  and  mingles  with  the  heedless  throng,  it  is  difficult  to <br/>conceive  of  man  as  actually  inhabiting  a  world  of  his  OAvn-a  world  which  he  has  discovered  by  lifting <br/>himself  into  communion  with  the  profundities  of  his  own  internal  nature.  Man  may  live  two  lives. <br/>One  is  a  struggle  from  the  womb  to  the  tomb.  Its  span  is  measured  by  man's  own  creation&#x2014;time.  Well <br/>may  it  be  called  the  unheeding  life.  The  other  life  is  from  realization  to  infinity.  It  begins  with <br/>understanding,  its  duration  is  forever,  and  upon  the  plane  of  eternity  it  is  consummated.  This  is  called <br/>the  philosophic  life.  Philosophers  are  nor  born  nor  do  they  die;  for  once  having  achieved  the <br/>realization  of  immortality,  they  are  immortal.  Having  once  communed  with  Self,  they  realize  that <br/>within  there  is  an  immortal  foundation  that  will  not  pass  away.  Upon  this  living,  vibrant  base&#x2014;Self&#x2014; <br/>they  erect  a  civilization  which  will  endure  after  the  sun,  the  moon,  and  the  stars  have  ceased  to  be. <br/>The  fool  lives  but  for  today;  the  philosopher  lives  forever. <br/><br/>When  once  the  rational  consciousness  of  man  rolls  away  the  stone  and  comes  forth  from  its  sepulcher, <br/>it  dies  no  more;  for  to  this  second  or  philosophic  birth  there  is  no  dissolution.  By  this  should  not  be <br/>inferred  physical  immortality,  but  rather  that  the  philosopher  has  learned  that  his  physical  body  is  no <br/>more  his  true  Self  than  the  physical  earth  is  his  true  world.  In  the  realization  that  he  and  his  body  are <br/>dissimilar&#x2014; that  though  the  form  must  perish  the  life  will  not  fail&#x2014; he  achieves  conscious  immortality. <br/>This  was  the  immortality  to  which  Socrates  referred  when  he  said:  &quot;Anytus  and  Melitus  may  indeed <br/>put  me  to  death,  but  they  cannot  injure  me.&quot;  To  the  wise,  physical  existence  is  but  the  outer  room  of <br/>the  hall  of  life.  Swinging  open  the  doors  of  this  antechamber,  the  illumined  pass  into  the  greater  and <br/>more  perfect  existence.  The  ignorant  dwell  in  a  world  bounded  by  time  and  space.  To  those,  however, <br/>who  grasp  the  import  and  dignity  of  Being,  these  are  but  phantom  shapes,  illusions  of  the  senses- <br/>arbitrary  limits  imposed  by  man's  ignorance  upon  the  duration  of  Deity.  The  philosopher  lives  and <br/>thrills  with  the  realization  of  this  duration,  for  to  him  this  infinite  period  has  been  designed  by  the <br/>All- Wise  Cause  as  the  time  of  all  accomplishment. <br/><br/>Man  is  not  the  insignificant  creature  that  he  appears  to  be;  his  physical  body  is  not  the  true  measure <br/>of  his  real  self.  The  invisible  nature  of  man  is  as  vast  as  his  comprehension  and  as  measureless  as  his <br/>thoughts.  The  fingers  of  his  mind  reach  out  and  grasp  the  stars;  his  spirit  mingles  with  the  throbbing <br/>life  of  Cosmos  itself.  He  who  has  attained  to  the  state  of  understanding  thereby  has  so  increased  his <br/>capacity  to  know  that  he  gradually  incorporates  within  himself  the  various  elements  of  the  universe. <br/>The  unknown  is  merely  that  which  is  yet  to  be  included  within  the  consciousness  of  the  seeker. <br/>Philosophy  assists  man  to  develop  the  sense  of  appreciation;  for  as  it  reveals  the  glory  and  the <br/>sufficiency  of  knowledge,  it  also  unfolds  those  latent  powers  and  faculties  whereby  man  is  enabled  to <br/>master  the  secrets  of  the  seven  spheres. <br/><br/>From  the  world  of  physical  pursuits  the  initiates  of  old  called  their  disciples  into  the  life  of  the  mind <br/>and  the  spirit.  Throughout  the  ages,  the  Mysteries  have  stood  at  the  threshold  of  Reality&#x2014; that <br/><br/><br/>hypothetical  spot  between  noumenon  and  phenomenon,  the  Substance  and  the  shadow.  The  gates  of <br/><br/>the  Mysteries  stand  ever  ajar  and  those  who  will  may  pass  through  into  the  spacious  domicile  of  spirit. <br/>The  world  of  philosophy  lies  neither  to  the  right  nor  to  the  left,  neither  above  nor  below.  Like  a  subtle <br/>essence  permeating  all  space  and  all  substance,  it  is  everywhere;  it  penetrates  the  innermost  and  the <br/>outermost  parts  of  all  being.  In  every  man  and  woman  these  two  spheres  are  connected  by  a  gate <br/>which  leads  from  the  not-self  and  its  concerns  to  the  Self  and  its  realizations.  In  the  mystic  this  gate  is <br/>the  heart,  and  through  spiritualization  of  his  emotions  he  contacts  that  more  elevated  plane  which, <br/>once  felt  and  known,  becomes  the  sum  of  the  worth-while.  In  the  philosopher,  reason  is  the  gate <br/>between  the  outer  and  the  inner  worlds,  the  illumined  mind  bridging  the  chasm  between  the <br/>corporeal  and  the  incorporeal.  Thus  godhood  is  born  within  the  one  who  sees,  and  from  the  concerns <br/>of  men  he  rises  to  the  concerns  of  gods. <br/><br/>In  this  era  of  &quot;practical&quot;  things  men  ridicule  even  the  existence  of  God.  They  scoff  at  goodness  while <br/>they  ponder  with  befuddled  minds  the  phantasmagoria  of  materiality.  They  have  forgotten  the  path <br/>which  leads  beyond  the  stars.  The  great  mystical  institutions  of  antiquity  which  invited  man  to  enter <br/>into  his  divine  inheritance  have  crumbled,  and  institutions  of  human  scheming  now  stand  where  once <br/>the  ancient  houses  of  learning  rose  a  mystery  of  fluted  columns  and  polished  marble.  The  white-robed <br/>sages  who  gave  to  the  world  its  ideals  of  culture  and  beauty  have  gathered  their  robes  about  them  and <br/>departed  from  the  sight  of  men.  Nevertheless,  this  little  earth  is  bathed  as  of  old  in  the  sunlight  of  its <br/>Providential  Generator.  Wide-eyed  babes  still  face  the  mysteries  of  physical  existence.  Men  continue <br/>to  laugh  and  cry,  to  love  and  hate;  Some  still  dream  of  a  nobler  world,  a  fuller  life,  a  more  perfect <br/>realization.  In  both  the  heart  and  mind  of  man  the  gates  which  lead  from  mortality  to  immortality  are <br/>still  ajar.  Virtue,  love,  and  idealism  are  yet  the  regenerators  of  humanity.  God  continues  to  love  and <br/>guide  the  destinies  of  His  creation.  The  path  still  winds  upward  to  accomplishment.  The  soul  of  man <br/>has  not  been  deprived  of  its  wings;  they  are  merely  folded  under  its  garment  of  flesh.  Philosophy  is <br/>ever  that  magic  power  which,  sundering  the  vessel  of  clay,  releases  the  soul  from  its  bondage  to  habit <br/>and  perversion.  Still  as  of  old,  the  soul  released  can  spread  its  wings  and  soar  to  the  very  source  of <br/>itself. <br/><br/>The  criers  of  the  Mysteries  speak  again,  bidding  all  men  welcome  to  the  House  of  Light.  The  great <br/>institution  of  materiality  has  failed.  The  false  civilization  built  by  man  has  turned,  and  like  the <br/>monster  of  Frankenstein,  is  destroying  its  creator.  Religion  wanders  aimlessly  in  the  maze  of <br/>theological  speculation.  Science  batters  itself  impotently  against  the  barriers  of  the  unknown.  Only <br/>transcendental  philosophy  knows  the  path.  Only  the  illumined  reason  can  carry  the  understanding <br/>part  of  man  upward  to  the  light.  Only  philosophy  can  teach  man  to  be  born  well,  to  live  well,  to  die <br/>well,  and  in  perfect  measure  be  born  again.  Into  this  band  of  the  elect&#x2014;those  who  have  chosen God The Catcher in the Rye\r\nJ. D Salina'er Although The Catcher in the Rye caused consider- D.* alinger able controversy when it was first published in\r\n1951, the book-the account of three disoriented\r\n1951 days in the life of a troubled sixteen-year-old boywas an instant hit. Within two weeks after its release, it was listed number one on The New York\r\nTimes best-seller list, and it stayed there for thirty\r\nweeks. It remained immensely popular for many\r\nyears, especially among teenagers and young\r\nadults, largely because of its fresh, brash style and\r\nanti-establishment attitudes-typical attributes of\r\nmany people emerging from the physical and psychological turmoil of adolescence.\r\nIt also was the bane of many parents, who objected to the main character's obscene language, erratic behavior, and antisocial attitudes. Responding\r\nto the irate protests, numerous school and public libraries and bookstores removed the book from their\r\nshelves. Holden simply was not a good role model\r\nfor the youth of the 1950s, in the view of many\r\nconservative adults. Said J. D. Salinger himself, in\r\na rare published comment, &quot;I'm aware that many\r\nof my friends will be saddened and shocked, or\r\nshock-saddened, over some of the chapters in The\r\nCatcher in the Rye. Some of my best friends are\r\nchildren. In fact, all my best friends are children.\r\nIt's almost unbearable for me to realize that my\r\nbook will be kept on a shelf out of their reach.&quot;\r\nThe clamor over the book undoubtedly contributed\r\nto its popularity among the young: It became the\r\nforbidden fruit in the garden of literature.\r\nI 1 6 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nFor some reason-perhaps because of the\r\nswirling controversies over his written worksSalinger retreated from the New York literary scene\r\nin the 1960s to a bucolic New Hampshire community called Comish, where he has lived a very private life and avidly avoided the press. Despite the\r\nfact that he has granted few interviews, there is a\r\nsubstantial body of critical and biographical works\r\nabout Salinger and his all-too-brief list of literary\r\ncreations.\r\nBorn in 1919 to a prosperous Manhattan family, Jerome David Salinger grew up in a New York\r\nCity milieu not unlike that of young Holden\r\nCaulfield. Being a diligent student was never his\r\nfirst priority: After he flunked out of several prep\r\nschools, including the prestigious McBumey\r\nSchool, his parents sent him to Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania, from which he\r\ngraduated in 1936. (Many people believe he modeled Pencey Prep, the fictional school attended by\r\nCaulfield, after Valley Forge.) He briefly attended\r\nUrsinus College, also in Pennsylvania, and New\r\nYork University, where he stayed one month.\r\nIt was not until he took a short story course at\r\nColumbia University that Salinger officially\r\nlaunched his literary career. His teacher, Whit Burnett, was the founder and editor of Story magazine,\r\nwhich gave a headstart to a number of mid-century\r\nfiction writers. Salinger's first published piece appeared in Story. Then he moved rapidly into the big\r\ntime of slick commercial magazines, writing short\r\npieces for Collier's, Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan and the\r\nupscale New Yorker.\r\nSalinger has consistently refused to allow anyone to republish his early stories-those written between 1941 and 1948. (However, they may still lurk\r\namong the microfilm or microfiche copies of old\r\nmagazines in local libraries.) Several are about\r\ndraftees in World War II and may mirror Salinger's\r\nown military experiences in that war. He served in\r\nthe Army Signal Corps and the Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1942 to 1945, participating in\r\nthe Normandy campaign and the liberation of\r\nFrance. Winner of five battle stars, he still found a\r\nway to keep writing during this period, toting a\r\nportable typewriter around in the back of his Jeep\r\n(as did Holden's brother, D. B., in the novel).\r\nJ. D. Salinger\r\nThe extant body of Salinger's work therefore\r\nconsists (in addition to The Catcher in the Rye) of\r\nthree collections of short stories: Nine Stories\r\n(1953), Franny and Zooey (1955) and Raise High\r\nthe RoofBeams (1963)- plus, of course, his more\r\nrecent book, Hapworth 16, 1924 (1997), which is\r\na republication of a former New Yorker novella.\r\nSince the early 1960s, Salinger has lived in\r\nseclusion in rural New Hampshire, his privacy\r\nfiercely protected by loyal friends and neighbors.\r\nMarried twice, he has two children, Margaret Ann\r\nand Matthew, from his second marriage. Both marriages ended in divorce.\r\nPart I-Holden Flunks out of Pencey\r\nPrep School\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye tells the story of Holden\r\nCaulfield, a teenage slacker who has perfected the\r\nart of underachievement. The novel begins with\r\nHolden flunking out of school for the fourth time.\r\nDuring the last days before his expulsion, he\r\nsearches for an appropriate way to conclude his\r\nschool experience, but he ends up getting so annoyed with his school and schoolmates that he\r\nV o I u 11 eI I 1 7\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nleaves in the middle of the night on the next train\r\nhome to New York City. Arriving home a few days\r\nearlier than his parents expect him, he hangs out in\r\nthe city to delay the inevitable confrontation with\r\nhis parents. When his money runs out, he considers hitchhiking out west, but he ultimately returns\r\nhome, mainly to be with his younger sister Phoebe.\r\nThe first few chapters describe Holden's last\r\ndays at Pencey Prep School in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Advertisements portray Pencey as an elite\r\nschool that grooms boys into sophisticated men, but\r\nHolden sees it as a nightmare of adolescence run\r\namok. Fed up with everything about Pencey,\r\nHolden skips the football game against Pencey's rival to say good-bye to his history teacher, Mr.\r\nSpencer. He vaguely hopes that Spencer might give\r\nhim some comfort and useful advice, but Spencer\r\nis a sick old man who simply lectures him with a\r\nthousand platitudes about not applying himself.\r\nLike Spencer, the other teachers and administrators\r\nrarely spend any time mentoring boys because they\r\nare too busy spouting off platitudes or kissing up\r\nto the wealthy parents visiting the school.\r\nMoreover, Pencey's students do not fit the prep\r\nschool ideal any more than its teachers do.\r\nHolden's classmate Robert Ackley, for example, is\r\nthe quintessential adolescent nerd. His acne and unbrushed teeth make him physically repulsive, while\r\nhis annoying social habits-such as barging into\r\nthe room uninvited, asking annoying questions, and\r\nrefusing to leave when asked-make him a general\r\nnuisance. Other students, like Holden's roommate\r\nWard Stradlater, initially appear sophisticated, but\r\neven they are really phonies. Stradlater seems\r\ngood-looking, but he is secretly a slob who never\r\ncleans his rusty old razor. He also appears to be a\r\nsuccessful student, but he is really an ungrateful\r\negotist who gets other people to do his assignments.\r\nNevertheless, Holden still feels a certain affection\r\neven for these annoying phonies. He is annoyed by\r\nAckley but still invites him to the movies, and he\r\nsees through Stradlater's phoniness but also notices\r\nhis occasional generosity.\r\nThe tension between Holden and his classmates eventually climaxes in a fight between\r\nHolden and Stradlater. Stradlater annoys Holden by\r\nasking him to write his English paper, so he can go\r\non a date with Jane Gallagher, an old friend of\r\nHolden's. Stradlater really angers Holden, however, when he returns from the date and begins insinuating that he did all kinds of stuff with Jane in\r\nthe back seat of a car. Fed up with Stradlater's\r\nphony nice-guy image, Holden picks a fight. Stradlater easily defeats the weaker Holden and gives\r\nhim a bloody nose. After the fight, Holden retreats\r\ninto Ackley's room to forget about Stradlater, but\r\nAckley only makes Holden more lonely. Then\r\nHolden goes into the hall to escape Ackley, but the\r\nhall is just as lonely. Surrounded by Pencey's allpervasive loneliness, Holden decides to return\r\nhome immediately instead of waiting for school to\r\nfinish. He quickly packs and heads for the train station late at night, but before departing he vents his\r\nfrustration with his schoolmates one last time.\r\nYelling loud enough to wake everyone, he screams\r\nhis final farewell to his moronic classmates.\r\nPart II-Holden's Adventures in New\r\nYork City\r\nThe middle section of the novel describes\r\nHolden's adventures in New York City. As soon\r\nas he arrives in New York, he looks for something\r\nto do, since it is too late to call his friends. He calls\r\nFaith Cavendish, a stripper recommended by a\r\nfriend, but she does not want to meet a stranger so\r\nlate. After a failed attempt to get a date with some\r\ngirls in the hotel bar, he takes a cab to another bar\r\nin Greenwich Village. When he returns to his hotel, a pimp named Maurice sets him up with a prostitute named Sunny, but Holden is too nervous to\r\ndo anything with her. The next day Holden asks his\r\nold girlfriend, Sally Hayes, to a show. While waiting to meet her, he has breakfast with two nuns and\r\n'buys a blues record for his sister. When he finally\r\nmeets Sally, they go to a concert and go skating,\r\nbut they eventually get into a fight and split up. After their fight, Holden meets an old classmate, Carl\r\nLuce, at the Wicker Bar, where they have a brief\r\ndiscussion until Holden gets drunk and starts asking inappropriately personal questions. After Carl\r\nleaves, the still-drunk Holden calls up Sally and\r\nmakes a fool of himself.\r\nPart II-Holden Returns Home\r\nThe last section of the novel describes\r\nHolden's return home. At first, Holden only wants\r\nto briefly say good-bye to his sister, Phoebe, so he\r\nsneaks into his house late at night in hopes of avoiding his parents. He successfully sneaks into the\r\nroom where his sister sleeps, aided by the lucky coincidence that his parents are not home. At first,\r\nPhoebe is delighted to see Holden, but she gets upset when she realizes that he has flunked out again.\r\nShe asks him why he flunked out, and he blames\r\nit on his terrible school. After listening to Holden's\r\nexcuses, Phoebe criticizes him for being too pessimistic. Holden tries to deny this by explaining\r\nI 1 8 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nMen at the Swing Rendezvous club in Greenwich Village, 1955.\r\nhow he likes lots of things, but he can only think\r\nof a few: his dead brother Allie, a kid named James\r\nCastle who died at one of his schools, and Phoebe.\r\nIn the end, Phoebe forces Holden to admit that he\r\nis a rather pessimistic failure. In the passage that\r\ngives the book its title, Holden explains that he cannot imagine himself fitting into any of the roles that\r\nsociety expects him to perform, like growing up to\r\nbe a lawyer or scientist. Instead, he can only imagine being a catcher in the rye who stands at the edge\r\nof a large rye field watching over and protecting\r\nlittle kids from danger.\r\n&quot;You know that song, 'If a body catch a body comin'\r\nthrough the rye'? I'd like-&quot;\r\n&quot;It's 'If a body meet a body coming through the rye' !&quot;\r\nold Phoebe said. &quot;It's a ppem. By Robert Burns.&quot;\r\n&quot;I know it's a poem by Robert Bums.&quot;\r\nShe was right, though. It is &quot;If a body meet a body\r\ncoming through the rye.&quot; I didn't know it then,\r\nthough.\r\n&quot;I thought it was 'If a body catch a body,&quot;' I said.\r\n&quot;Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody\r\nbig, I mean-except me. And I'm standing on the\r\nedge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have\r\nto catch everybody if they start to go over the cliffI mean if they're running and they don't look where\r\nthey're going I have to come out from somewhere\r\nand catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd be the\r\ncatcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's\r\nthe only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.&quot;\r\nIn this passage, Salinger brilliantly blends the\r\ntwo sides of Holden's character. On the one hand,\r\nHolden admits that he is a failure: he is incapable\r\nof even imagining himself functioning in the adult\r\nworld. On the other hand, however, Holden is not\r\nonly a failure: he is also a deeply sensitive and compassionate person, albeit in an unorthodox way. In\r\nparticular, he understands and cares about people\r\nwho are outcasts or powerless. Phoebe seems to understand and accept this unorthodox sensitivity because she eventually reconciles herself to him, and\r\nthey celebrate their reconciliation by dancing until\r\ntheir parents return and Holden has to sneak back\r\nout of the house.\r\nAfter sneaking out of the house, Holden spends\r\nthe night with his favorite teacher, Mr. Antolini,\r\nbut he leaves early in the morning when he wakes\r\nup to find Mr. Antolini stroking his hair. Confused\r\nby such unusual behavior, Holden spends the morning wandering the streets until he eventually decides to hitchhike out west. He leaves a note at\r\nPhoebe's school telling her to meet him at the museum so they can say good-bye, but Phoebe shows\r\nup carrying her own belongings in a suitcase beV o I u me I I 1 9\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\ncause she wants to go with Holden. At this point,\r\nHolden realizes how important they are to each\r\nother, and he finally decides to return home and\r\nface his parents. The novel never actually describes\r\nwhat happens next, but it suggests that Holden\r\nfaces the dreadful confrontation with his parents\r\nand then later experiences some sort of nervous\r\nbreakdown. The novel concludes with Holden\r\nlooking back at all the people he has described and\r\nfondly remembering how he likes them despite\r\ntheir annoying and phony qualities.\r\nRobert Ackley\r\nHolden's unpleasant dormmate, whose personal habits are dirty and whose room stinks.\r\nHolden suspects that Ackley does not brush his\r\nteeth and describes them as mossy. Cursed with\r\nacne, Ackley constantly picks at the sores. Ackley\r\ndislikes Stadlater, calling him a &quot;son of a bitch.&quot;\r\nHolden finds Ackley disgusting but appears to feel\r\nsorry for him at the same time.\r\nMr. Antolini\r\nHolden's former English teacher, Mr. Antolini,\r\n&quot;the best teacher I ever had,&quot; invited Holden to\r\ncome right over, even though Holden probably\r\nwoke him and his wife up in the middle of the night.\r\nMr. Antolini asked why Holden was no longer at\r\nPencey, warned him about heading for a fall, and\r\nwrote down a quote on paper for him: &quot;The mark\r\nof the immature man is that he wants to die nobly\r\nfor a cause, while the mark of the mature man is\r\nthat he wants to live humbly for one.&quot; Later that\r\nnight, after falling asleep on the couch, Holden\r\nwakes up to find Mr. Antolini patting his head in\r\nthe dark. Holden leaps up, convinced Mr. Antolini\r\nis a pervert, and rushes out of the apartment. Later\r\nHolden is unsure whether his reaction was mistaken.\r\nAllie Caulfield\r\nAllie Caulfield is Holden's younger brother.\r\nWhile he has died of leukemia, he is very much\r\nalive throughout the book. Holden refers to him as\r\nstill living and even talks to him. Bright and charming, Allie is/was Holden's best friend other than\r\nPhoebe.\r\nD. B. Caulfield\r\nD.B. Caulfield is Holden's and Phoebe's older\r\nbrother. He is a successful and financially secure\r\nscreenwriter in Hollywood. But Holden feels that\r\nD.B. has prostituted his art for money and should\r\ninstead be writing serious works. While D.B. shows\r\ngreat solicitude for Holden, the relationship between the brothers is distant.\r\nHolden Caulfield\r\nHolden Caulfield is a deeply troubled sixteenyear-old boy who is totally alienated from his environment and from society as a whole. He looks\r\non people and events with a distaste bordering on\r\ndisgust. The reader can view him either as an adolescent struggling with the angst of growing up (the\r\nPeter Pan syndrome) or as a rebel against what he\r\nperceives as hypocrisy (phoniness) in the world of\r\nadults (i.e., society).\r\nThe novel is the recollection of three depressing days in Holden's life when his accumulated\r\nanger and frustration converge to create a life crisis. The events of this long weekend eventually propel him to a hospital where he is treated for both\r\nphysical and mental disorders. Since the book is\r\nwritten in the first person, we see all people and\r\nevents through Holden's eyes. He tells his story\r\nfrom the vantage point of the 17-year-old Caulfield,\r\nwho is still in a California hospital at the outset of\r\nthe book.\r\nHe begins with a statement of anger that includes the reader in its sarcasm:\r\n&quot;If you really want to hear about it, the first thing\r\nyou'll probably want to know is where I was born,\r\nand what my lousy childhood was like, and how my\r\nparents were occupied and all before they had me and\r\nall that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't\r\nfeel like going into it, if you want to know the truth....\r\nI'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas\r\njust before I got pretty run-down and had to come\r\nout here and take it easy.... Where I want to start\r\ntelling about is the day I left Pencey Prep.&quot;\r\nHolden has once again flunked out of prep\r\nschool, where he failed every subject but English.\r\nOn this day, he says goodbye to his history teacher,\r\nMr. Spencer, who is home with the grippe. He\r\nviews the sick man with both sympathy and disgust and escapes hastily after the teacher begins to\r\nlecture him about flunking out of three prep\r\nschools.\r\nThe novel continues with equally flawed encounters with two fellow students, Bob Ackley and\r\nhis playboy roommate, Ward Stradlater. Holden decides to leave Pencey that very night.\r\n1 2 0 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nHe packs his belongings, heads to the railroad\r\nstation and grabs a train to New York City. There\r\nhe embarks on a harrowing weekend staying at hotels, frequenting bars, and trying desperately to\r\ncommunicate with everyone he meets-the mother\r\nof a classmate (to whom he lies about his identity),\r\nhangers-out in bars, taxi drivers, a prostitute and\r\nher pimp, and two nuns in a restaurant. His two\r\nmost memorable encounters are with his old friend,\r\nthe pseudo-sophisticated Sally Hayes, and a former\r\nschoolmate, Carl Luce. Both take place on Sunday.\r\nLate Sunday night-thoroughly chilled from\r\nsitting in Central Park and having used up most of\r\nhis money and everyone else's patience-Holden\r\nsneaks into his family's apartment. He wakes up\r\nhis engaging ten-year-old sister, Phoebe. Phoebe is\r\nthe only human being with whom Holden can\r\ncommunicate except for the memory of Allie, for\r\nwhom he continually grieves. Phoebe represents\r\nthe innocence and honesty of childhood, which is\r\nall Holden truly respects-a viewpoint shared in\r\npart by Salinger himself. (In contrast, Holden sees\r\nhis older brother, D.B., as a &quot;prostitute&quot; because he\r\nhas sold out his art, becoming a Hollywood\r\nscriptwriter instead of what Holden views as a serious writer.)\r\nPhoebe is direct and blunt. When she leams\r\nthat Holden has been expelled from yet another private school, her instant comment is, &quot;Daddy'll kill\r\nyou.&quot; And of course that's what Holden has been\r\nrunning away from all weekend-confronting his\r\nparents about his expulsion. Later, Phoebe tells\r\nhim: &quot;You don't like anything that's happening ...\r\nYou don't like any schools. You don't like a million things. You don't.&quot; Holden is stunned and defensive. When he tries to think of something he\r\nlikes, he finally comes down to nothing but Allie\r\nand Phoebe. He tells Phoebe that he's going to\r\nhitchhike to Colorado and start a new life there.\r\nStill avoiding his parents, he arranges to spend\r\nthe rest of Sunday night with a former favorite English teacher, Mr. Antolini, and his somewhat frowsy\r\nwife. During the night, he awakes to find Antolini\r\nstroking his hair. He immediately panics, deciding\r\nthat Antolini is just another pervert in a world full\r\nof twisted people, and flees the Antolini apartment.\r\nOn Monday, he goes to Phoebe's school to\r\nleave a message for her to meet him at the Museum\r\nof Natural History. He wants to say goodbye. When\r\nPhoebe shows up, she is dragging a huge suitcase\r\nalong the sidewalk. She intends to go with him.\r\nThis is not in his plan at all. Instead, he takes her\r\nto the Central Park Zoo. While watching her ride\r\non the merry-go-round, he worries that she'll fall\r\noff while trying to catch the gold ring. &quot;The thing\r\nwith kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring,\r\nyou have to let them do it, and not say anything. If\r\nthey fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say\r\nanything to them,&quot; muses Caulfield. This, in a way,\r\nis the end of a dream he has told Phoebe:\r\n&quot; ... I keep picturing all these little kids playing some\r\ngame in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of\r\nlittle kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I\r\nmean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of\r\nsome crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch\r\neverybody if they start to go over the cliff-I mean\r\nif they're running and they don't look where they're\r\ngoing. I have to come out from somewhere and catch\r\nthem. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher\r\nin the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the\r\nonly thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.&quot;\r\nIs this a tuming point in Holden's withdrawal\r\nfrom the world-a point at which he know he has\r\nto accept the inevitable realities of life and people?\r\nOr will he continue to run away toward his dream\r\nof saving the world?\r\nWe leave Holden where we found him-or he\r\nfound us-in the Califomia hospital. When he is\r\nwell, his brother D.B. will drive him back East,\r\nwhere he will attend yet another school.\r\nHolden Caulfield is both tragic and funny, innocent and obscene, loving and cruel, clear-sighted\r\nyet viewing the world from a warped perspective,\r\nan expert in identifying phonies and the greatest\r\nphony himself. Of course, how you see Holden depends upon your own point of view. For many\r\nyoung readers of the book, especially in the 1950s\r\nand '60s, Holden still represented the true realitythe innocent abroad in a corrupt world. For older\r\nreaders, he represents the angst of adolescence in\r\nits nightmarish extreme. For the ultraconservative,\r\nhe still remains a threat to the status quo.\r\nPhoebe Caulfield\r\nPhoebe Caulfield, Holden Caulfield's pretty,\r\nredheaded ten-year-old sister, is straightforward\r\nand independent. She says exactly what she means.\r\nShe does not share Holden's disenchanted view of\r\nthe world. Quite the opposite, she scolds Holden\r\nfor not liking anything at all. This hurts him very\r\nmuch because Phoebe is his favorite person-the\r\nonly one with whom he can truly communicate.\r\nPhoebe is bright, well-organized, and creative. She\r\nkeeps all her school work neatly in notebooks, each\r\nlabeled with a different subject. She also loves to\r\nwrite books about a fictional girl detective named\r\nHazle [sic] Weatherfield, but according to Holden,\r\nshe never finishes them. Holden delights in taking\r\nV o I u m e I 1 2 1\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nher to the zoo and the movies and other places, as\r\ndid their dead brother, Allie. Her directness and\r\nhonesty are both refreshing and amusing.\r\nFaith Cavendish\r\nFaith Cavendish is the first person Holden calls\r\nwhen he gets to New York City. He met her previously at a party, where she was the date of a\r\nPrinceton student. A burlesque stripper, she is supposed to be an &quot;easy&quot; conquest. She turns down\r\nHolden's invitation to get together and wishes him\r\na nice weekend in New York.\r\nJane Gallagher\r\nWhile she does not appear in the book, Jane\r\nGallagher is very much present. Holden has a crush\r\non this attractive and interesting young woman,\r\nwho dances well and plays golf abominably. He resents the fact that his roommate, Stadlater, takes\r\nher out on a date and suspects that Stadlater, who\r\nlikes to brag about his alleged sexual conquests,\r\nhas forced her to have sex with him. When he first\r\narrives in New York, Holden wants to call her up,\r\nbut he never actually does so.\r\nSally Hayes\r\nSally Hayes is Holden's very attractive ex-girlfriend. He considers her stupid, possibly because\r\nshe has an affected, pseudo-sophisticated manner.\r\nBut he makes a date with her anyway. They go ice\r\nskating in Rockefeller Center, then go to a bar.\r\nHolden asks her to go away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont. She refuses, pointing out that\r\nthey are much too young to set up housekeeping\r\ntogether and that college and Holden's career come\r\nfirst.\r\nHolden doesn't want to hear about a traditional\r\ncareer. He becomes angry and tells Sally she's a\r\n&quot;royal pain in the ass.&quot; She &quot;hit the ceiling&quot; and\r\nleft. Later, drunk, he calls her late at night to tell\r\nher that, yes, he will come to help trim her family's Christmas tree.\r\nHorwitz\r\nHorwitz is the second taxi driver Holden encounters in New York City. Holden tries to strike\r\nup a conversation with him about where the ducks\r\nin Central Park go when the water in the lake\r\nfreezes over. But Horwitz obviously considers\r\nHolden somewhat of a loony and is abrupt with\r\nhim.\r\nCarl Luce\r\nCarl Luce, Holden's former schoolmate, ostensibly his Student Adviser, was about three years\r\nolder and &quot;one of these very intellectual guys-he\r\nhad the highest I.Q. of any boy at Whooton.&quot;\r\nHolden called him, hoping to have dinner and\r\n&quot;a slightly intellectual conversation,&quot; but Luce\r\ncould only meet him for a drink at the Wicker Bar\r\nat ten that evening.\r\nHe arrived saying he could only stay a few\r\nminutes, ordered a martini, kept trying to get\r\nHolden to lower his voice and change the subject.\r\nBefore leaving, he suggested that Holden call his\r\nfather, a psychoanalyst, for an appointment.\r\nMrs. Morrow\r\nMrs. Morrow is the mother of Holden's classmate, Ernest. Holden runs into her on the train to\r\nNew York. They have a superficial conversation in\r\nwhich Mrs. Morrow is very friendly. So is\r\nHolden- but he lies about his identity because he\r\ndoesn't want Mrs. Morrow to know he has been\r\nkicked out of school.\r\nPiano Player in the Wicker Bar\r\nHolden encounters the Wicker Bar's &quot;flitty&quot;\r\npiano player in the men's room. He asks him to\r\nfind out whether the waiter delivered his message\r\nto the singer, Valencia, whom Holden wanted to\r\ninvite to his table. The piano man, seeing how\r\ndrunk Holden is, tells him to go home.\r\nLfllian Simmons\r\nLillian Simmons is D.B.'s ex-girlfriend.\r\nHolden's main observation about her: &quot;She has big\r\nknockers.&quot; Holden encounters her in Ernie's, a\r\nGreenwich Village hangout, where she introduces\r\nHolden to her companion, Navy Commander\r\n&quot;Blop.&quot;\r\nMr. Spencer\r\nMr. Spencer is Holden Caulfield's history\r\nteacher at Pencey. Before leaving on Saturday of\r\nhis long weekend, Holden goes to Spencer's house\r\nto say goodbye. Spencer, ill with the grippe, is\r\nwearing pajamas and a bathrobe. Holden finds old\r\nmen dressed this way to be pathetic, with their pale,\r\nskinny legs sticking out under their bathrobes and\r\ntheir pajama tops askew, revealing their pale, wispy\r\nchests. Spencer obviously likes Caulfield, but he\r\ncannot resist giving him a lecture on his poor performance in history. Holden listens, agrees, and\r\nleaves as soon as he can.\r\n1 2 2 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nWard Stradlater\r\nWard Stradlater is Holden's obnoxious roommate at Pencey Prep. A playboy, he asks Holden\r\nto write an essay on a room or a house for him\r\nwhile he goes out on a date with Jane Gallagher,\r\nthe girl Holden really cares about. A resentful\r\nHolden writes an essay about his brother Allie's\r\nbaseball glove, on which Allie scribbled Emily\r\nDickinson poems. A secret slob (he shaves with a\r\ndirty, rusty razor), Stradlater makes a good appearance. Smooth and slick, he likes to boast about\r\nhis alleged sexual prowess. When he returns from\r\nhis date, he is irate because Holden has written an\r\nessay about a baseball glove instead of a house.\r\nHolden tears it up, has an argument with Stradlater,\r\nand ends up in a fistfight with him.\r\nSunny\r\nSunny is the prostitute Holden requests. When\r\nshe comes to his room in the Edmont Hotel, she\r\ndiscovers that Holden just wants someone to talk\r\nwith. She leaves in disgust. Later, she returns with\r\nher pimp, Maurice, the hotel's elevator operator.\r\nThey demand another five dollars for her time.\r\nHolden protests, and after she takes the money from\r\nhis wallet.\r\nThree girls from Seattle\r\nAfter checking ip and calling Faith Cavendish,\r\nHolden goes to the bar of the Edmont Hotel-&quot;a\r\ngoddam hotel&quot; that was &quot;full of perverts and morons,&quot; comments Holden. In the bar, he strikes up\r\na conversation with three thirty-ish girls from Seattle who are spending their vacation touring New\r\nYork City. He dances with them all, one by one,\r\nbut the whole experience fizzles and he leaves the\r\nbar, calls a cab, and goes to Ernie's, a night club\r\nin Greenwich Village.\r\nTwo Nuns\r\nTwo nuns with whom Holden strikes up a conversation in a restaurant. They are both school\r\nteachers, and Holden charms them with his expressions of enthusiasm about English literature.\r\nSince they have a wicker collection basket with\r\nthem, Holden gives them $10 as a contribution to\r\ntheir charity.\r\nAlienation and Loneliness\r\nThe main theme that runs through this book is\r\nalienation, whether the book is read as the\r\nfunny/tragic account of a deeply troubled, rebellious, and defensive teenager or as a commentary\r\non a smug and meaningless social milieu. Phoebe\r\nsums up Holden's sense of separateness from and\r\nanger at other people when she tells him he doesn't like anything. Holden's red hunting cap, which\r\nhe dons when he is most insecure, is a continuing\r\nsymbol throughout the book of his feeling that he\r\nis different, doesn't fit into his environment, and,\r\nwhat's more, doesn't want to fit in.\r\nFailure\r\nA second theme is that of failure. Holden continually sets himself up for failure, then wears it\r\nlike a badge of courage. Thus he fails in every encounter with other people in the book with the exception of Phoebe. Why would a sixteen-year-old\r\nwant to fail? Failure serves as a great attention-getting device. And perhaps, more than anything,\r\nHolden wants attention from his parents, the absent\r\ncharacters in the book. What Holden really longs\r\nfor, most likely, is acceptance and love.\r\nGuilt and Innocence\r\nHolden is deceitful and manipulative in most\r\nof his dealings with others. And he knows this all\r\ntoo well and even boasts of his prowess as a liar.\r\nBut throughout the book we glimpse another\r\nHolden, the one who feels sorry for the people he\r\ncons. His basic kindness comes through in\r\nglimpses, particularly in the passage where he reveals that the only thing he would like to be is a\r\n&quot;catcher in the rye&quot; protecting innocent children\r\nfrom falling into the abyss of adulthood.\r\nAnger\r\nHolden is angry at everyone except Allie and\r\nPhoebe and perhaps the ducks in the pond in Central Park. Anger, of course, is the flip side of hurt.\r\nHolden is wounded by his disappointment in the\r\nfaults of the world and frustrated because he finally\r\nrealizes that he can't fix them. His failures may also\r\nbe a way of acting out his anger at his parents and\r\nsociety at large.\r\nSexuality\r\nHolden struggles with his emerging sexuality.\r\nHe is unable to relate in any meaningful way to the\r\ngirls he encounters along the way, writing them off\r\nas sex objects. He writes off other males as perverts or morons and views their sexuality with disgust. Confusion about sexual identity is common\r\nin adolescents. For Holden, it is terrifying.\r\nV o I u m e I 1 2 3\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nTopics for\r\nFurther\r\nStudy\r\n* Investigate current research on adolescent psychology. According to current theory, argue\r\nwhether Holden Caulfield is a typical troubled\r\nadolescent or a seriously mentally ill young\r\nman.\r\n* Is Holden Caulfield a reliable narrator? Why or\r\nwhy not?\r\n* Compare Holden's generation of the 1940s to\r\ntoday's generation. How are the two cultures\r\nsimilar and different?\r\nCourage\r\nCourage is one of the subtle themes running\r\nthroughout the novel. Holden, in his own twisted\r\nway, confronts the demons in his life and, therefore, stands a chance of wrestling them to the floor.\r\nNarrator\r\nIn essence, we have three narrators of the\r\nevents that take place in this book. The first is the\r\nauthor, J. D. Salinger, who was looking back in\r\nanger (or in creativity) from his thirty-two-year-old\r\nvantage point. The second is the seventeen-yearold Holden, still institutionalized, who tells the\r\nstory as a recollection. And the third, and most immediate, is the sixteen-year-old Holden who does\r\nall the talking. The form of the narration is first\r\nperson, in which a character uses &quot;I&quot; to relate\r\nevents from his or her perspective.\r\nStream of Consciousness\r\nThe technique of the narration is a form known\r\nas &quot;stream of consciousness.&quot; While the book proceeds in a rough chronological order, the events are\r\nrelated to the reader as Holden thinks of them.\r\nWherever his mind wanders, the reader follows.\r\nNotice how his language often appears to be more\r\nlike that of a ten-year-old than that of a smart sixteen-year-old. This is a continuing demonstration\r\nof Holden's unwillingness to grow up and join the\r\nhypocritical adult world that he despises. Holden's\r\nconversation in the Wicker Bar with Luce demonstrates this reluctance aptly, when Luce expresses\r\nannoyance at Holden's immaturity.\r\nSetting\r\nThe settings for The Catcher in the RyePencey Prep and New York City-were the settings for J. D. Salinger's early life as well, although\r\nthe novel is not strictly autobiographical. Through\r\nhis description of Holden's history teacher, Mr.\r\nSpencer, and his portrayals of Holden's fellow students, Salinger recreates the stifling atmosphere of\r\na 1940s prep school, where a sense of alienation\r\noften resutled from not conforming to narrow social standards. The New York City where Holden\r\nspent his nightmare weekend is the same Manhattan where Salinger grew up-smaller, a little\r\nhomier, and a lot less glitzy than the New York\r\nCity of today. And Holden's home and family are\r\nsimilar to those of Salinger. However, Salinger had\r\nonly one sibling, a brother. From the taxi ride, to\r\nthe seedy hotel where Holden stayed, to Rockefeller Center to Central Park, Holden's New York\r\nis tangible, real, and plays an active role like any\r\nother character in the book. The descriptions of\r\nplaces and events are colorful and immediate.\r\nSalinger entices us into Holden's world whole and\r\nwithout resistance. He is a master of vivid story\r\ntelling.\r\nSymbolism\r\nThe book is rich in symbolism. The author\r\ndrops hints of the meaning of its title twice before\r\nwe find out what it is. The first time, Holden hears\r\na little boy in New York sing-songing &quot;If a body\r\nmeet a body comin' through the rye,&quot; an Americanization of Robert Bums's poem and the song it\r\ninspired. The second time, Holden is with Phoebe\r\nand brings up the topic, referring to the song as &quot;If\r\na body catch a body comin' through the rye.&quot;\r\nPhoebe corrects him. But Holden's dream of being\r\na catcher in the rye (derived from the second line\r\nof the poem) persists. He will save the children\r\nfrom adulthood and disillusionment.\r\nHolden's red hat is an abiding symbol throughout the book of his self-conscious isolation from\r\nother people. He dons it whenever he is insecure.\r\nIt almost becomes his alter ego. After he gives it\r\nto Phoebe, she gives it back to him. We do not\r\nknow at the end of the book whether he still needs\r\nthis equivalent of a security blanket.\r\n1 2 4 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nPostwar Prosperity\r\nThe events in The Catcher in the Rye take place\r\nin 1946, only a year after the end of World War II.\r\nAdults at this time had survived the Great Depression and the multiple horrors of the war. Paradoxically, the war that wounded and killed so many\r\npeople was the same instrument that launched the\r\nnation into an era of seemingly unbounded prosperity. During the postwar years, the gross national\r\nproduct rose to $500 billion, compared with $200\r\nbillion in prewar 1940. In unprecedented numbers,\r\npeople bought houses, television sets, second cars,\r\nwashing machines, and other consumer goods. No\r\nwonder the nation wanted to forget the past and to\r\ncelebrate its new beginnings. The celebration took\r\nthe form of a new materialism and extreme conservatism. Traditional values were the norm. People did not want to hear from the Holden Caulfields\r\nand J. D. Salingers of the era. They were in a state\r\nof blissful denial.\r\nHolden has withdrawn from this society\r\nenough to see it from a different perspective. He\r\nabhors the banality and hypocrisy he sees in the\r\nadult world and is therefore reluctant to participate\r\nin it, so his behavior, while that of an adolescent\r\ntrying to affirm his own identity, also symbolizes\r\nthe perceived shallowness of people and society.\r\nMost of the things Holden fears peak in the 1950s,\r\nwhen conservatism, rigid morality, and paranoid\r\nself-righteousness held the nation in a tight grip.\r\nSmall wonder that 1950s parents assailed\r\nSalinger's novel when it hit book stores and libraries in 1951. It undermined the foundations of\r\ntheir beliefs and threatened to unsettle their placid\r\nbut pleasant existence, which was sustained by their\r\nhatred of an outside enemy-communism.\r\nCold War Concern\r\nDespite the materialistic prosperity of the\r\n1950s, many people were concerned about what appeared to be a troubling future. The Soviet Union\r\nacquired nuclear technology soon after the war, and\r\nthe successful launch of the first artificial satellite,\r\nSputnik, in 1957 appeared to give the Russians a\r\nthreatening advantage over the United States.\r\nAmericans also questioned the success of their educational system, which had failed them in the\r\nspace race. The fear of nuclear war became so pervasive that students were regularly drilled on how\r\nto &quot;duck and cover&quot; in the case of an attack, and\r\nmany families built bomb shelters in their backyards and stocked them with food and other supplies to survive a possible holocaust.\r\nEducation\r\nIn 1950 about ten percent of all children were\r\neducated in Catholic schools, which at the time received federal funding. This became a topic for debate as people disputed whether or not private institutions should receive taxpayer money. Public\r\nschools that employed Roman Catholic nuns as\r\nteachers also became a target of debate, as some\r\nstates, such as Wisconsin, denied these schools\r\npublic support. Such actions were supported by the\r\nNational Education Association, which took a\r\nstrong antireligious stance. On the other hand, the\r\nNational Catholic Educational Association argued\r\nthat Catholic citizens supported public schools, and\r\nso it was unfair to deny parochial schools funding\r\nwhen they were meeting the same educational\r\ngoals. Religion was more prevalent in public\r\nschools during the 1950s; religious topics were routinely taught in public schools: students listened to\r\nBible readings (which were required in twelve\r\nstates and the District of Columbia), and many students were given &quot;released-time&quot; breaks, during\r\nwhich they were allowed to leave school for one\r\nhour a week to attend religious classes.\r\nPressure to Conform\r\nSocial pressures to conform were intense in the\r\n1950s, not only in politics but also within the nation's educational system, which enjoyed multiple\r\ninfusions of government funds. A college education became the passport to prosperity, especially\r\nafter the G.I. bill of 1944 helped pay for war veterans' higher education. Corporations grew rapidly\r\nto meet the increasing demands of consumers and\r\nsopped up the growing number of skilled employees. Dress codes and embedded company cultures\r\nmuted individualism. Jobs for white males were secure, while women stayed home and raised the\r\nmany children ushered in by the postwar &quot;Baby\r\nBoom.&quot;\r\nThe Growing Generation Gap\r\nThe &quot;Baby Boom&quot; caused Americans to pay\r\nmore attention to the younger generation. While\r\nCatcher in the Rye was somewhat before its time\r\nin this regard, the subject had particular relevance\r\nin the years after its publication. Lifestyles began\r\nto change dramatically as teenagers began to date\r\nand become sexually active at a younger age.\r\nTeenagers became more rebellious, a trend that\r\ntheir parents viewed to be strongly influenced by a\r\nV o I u m e I 1 2 5\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i\r\nCompare\r\n&amp;\r\nC'ontrast\r\n* 1950s: Religion is an integral part of many\r\nclassrooms. Bible readings and regular lessons\r\nabout religious topics are included in course\r\nplans.\r\nToday: The separation of Church and State is\r\nrigorously upheld and children do not study religious texts; prayer in schools becomes a burning issue, and there is growing pressure from religious factions to have educators teach\r\ncreationism to counterbalance lessons in Charles\r\nDarwin's theory of evolution.\r\n* 1950s: Only about 58% of students finish high\r\nschool, but jobs are so plentiful that employment\r\nrates remain high. Employer loyalty is the norm,\r\nand employees often remain with one company\r\nuntil they retire.\r\nToday: Most employers that offer jobs with living-wage incomes require employees to have\r\ncollege degrees, even for low-level positions.\r\nRoutine layoffs and downsizing largely eliminate company loyalty, and it becomes common\r\nfor workers to switch jobs and even careers.\r\n* 1950s: Classroom curricula focus on basic\r\nskills, including reading, writing, and arithmetic, but the inclusion of science in classes becomes a growing priority as the educational system tries to prepare students for the needs of a\r\nmore technology-oriented world.\r\nToday: Educators aim to give students wellrounded educations that include sex education\r\nand an emphasis on multicultural studies; parents become concerned that children are not being taught the basics and that high school students are graduating without knowing how to\r\nread. Educators recognize the need to train students in the use of computers, which become\r\ncommon equipment in classrooms and libraries.\r\n1950s: Postwar prosperity brings with it a preoccupation with material goods as the middleclasses enjoy unprecedented buying power; children begin to rebel against this crass materialism\r\nand conservatism, and nonconformist icons like\r\nactor James Dean become popular.\r\nToday: Adults who were the rebellious children\r\nof the 1950s and 1960s long for a return of the\r\n&quot;family values&quot; of the 1950s; &quot;family values&quot;\r\nbecomes a campaign buzz phrase for politicians\r\nas the American people return to conservative\r\nbeliefs.\r\nnew, decadent form of music called rock 'n' roll.\r\nThis new attitude of rebelliousness was typified by\r\nHollywood actors such as James Dean and Marlon\r\nBrando, the bohemian lifestyle of the beatniks, and\r\nlater in the literature of Jack Kerouac and Alan\r\nGinsberg. Juvenile delinquency became an alarming problem and was considered a major social issue. Teens were skipping classes and committing\r\ncrimes, and parents were alarmed by their children's lack of respect for authority.\r\nMixed reviews greeted J. D. Salinger's first\r\nnovel, The Catcher in the Rye, published on July\r\n16, 1951. New York Times critic Nash K. Burger,\r\nfor example, lauded the book as &quot;an unusually brilliant first novel,&quot; and Chicago Tribune reviewer\r\nPaul Engle called the novel &quot;engaging and believable.&quot; In contrast, T. Morris Longstreth stated in\r\nthe Christian Science Monitor that &quot;the book was\r\nnot fit for children to read.&quot; Regarding Holden\r\nCaulfield, the book's teenage narrator and protagonist, Longstreth wrote: &quot;Fortunately there cannot\r\nbe many of him yet. But one fears that a book like\r\nthis given wide circulation may multiply his kindas too easily happens when immorality and perversion are recounted by writers of talent whose\r\nwork is countenanced in the name of art of good\r\nintention.&quot; In the novel's defense, critic James\r\nBryan wrote in PMLA: &quot;The richness of spirit in\r\nN o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nn t h e R y e\r\n1 2 6\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nLever House on Park Avenue, a typical 1950s office in New York City.\r\nthis novel, especially of the vision, the compassion\r\nand the humor of the narrator, reveal a psyche far\r\nhealthier than that of the boy who endured the\r\nevents of this narrative. Through the telling of his\r\nstory, Holden has given shape to, and thus achieved\r\ncontrol of, his troubled past.&quot;\r\nIt can be argued that The Catcher in the Rye\r\nis as much a critique of society as a revelation of\r\nthe rebellion and angst of a teenage boy. The book\r\ntakes potshots at a post-World War II society full\r\nof self-righteousness and preoccupied by the pursuit of the &quot;American Dream&quot; of everlasting prosperity. Salinger depicts this goal as being empty\r\nand meaningless. Commented the great American\r\nnovelist William Faulkner, who praised Salinger's\r\nnovel, &quot;When Holden attempted to enter the human race, there was no human race there.&quot;\r\nThe reader never finds out how Holden turns\r\nout. Will he compromise with the realities of people and society, becoming like the people he despised? Will the banality of everyday events engulf\r\nhis reluctant coming of age, leaving him a tormented misfit for the rest of his life? Or will he become a superhero, leading others out of the slough\r\nof the ordinary and into a more enlightened view\r\nof life? The reader will never know unless Salinger\r\nwrites a sequel. His most recent novel, Hapworth\r\n16, 1924, released in the spring of 1997, is a republication of a long short story that appeared in\r\nthe New Yorker in the 1960s. The featured character in the new book is Seymour Glass, member of\r\nanother well-to-do fictional New York family depicted in a number of Salinger short stories. For\r\nsome readers and critics, however, the endless saga\r\nof the eccentric Glass family eventually wore out\r\nits welcome. The Catcher in the Rye and Hapworth\r\n16, 1924 are the only two novels Salinger has thus\r\nfar written. But he did write a wealth of short stories for such magazines as the New Yorker, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's.\r\nIf The Catcher in the Rye were introduced as\r\na new book today, it would certainly not be considered as shocking now as it was in the 1950s. But\r\nit would still be viewed as a true and vivid portrait\r\nof adolescent angst. It can therefore rightly take its\r\nplace among the literary classics of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\nRobert Bennett\r\nIn thefollowing essay, Bennett, a doctoral candidate at the University of California-Berkeley,\r\nargues that despite its status as a &quot;minor&quot; classic,\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye is a work with literary sigV o I u m e I 1 2 7\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nWhat\r\nDo I Read\r\nNext?\r\n* The Member of the Wedding (1946) by Carson\r\nMcCullers tells of an awkward young girl living in a southem town as she suffers the pangs\r\nof growing up and feelings of isolation.\r\n* In her influential first novel, The Outsiders\r\n(1967), S.

Hinton, who was a teenager when she wrote the\r\nnovel, creates remarkable, sympathetic portraits\r\nof the troubled teens in the Greasers gang.\r\n* In Judith Guest's Ordinary People (1976), a disturbed teenager comes to grips with the events\r\nunderlying his attempted suicide with the help\r\nof his psychotherapist.\r\n* Three Friends (1984), by Myron Levoy, in\r\nwhich an intelligent fourteen-year-old boy who\r\nenjoys chess and psychology becomes involved\r\nwith Karen, a feminist activist, and her artistic\r\nfriend, Lori; all three consider themselves outsiders and develop complex and troubled relationships with each other.\r\nnificance that rewards the reader with several types\r\nof interpretations.\r\nEven though The Catcher in the Rye is usually\r\nconsidered only a &quot;minor&quot; classic of American fiction, it is a very popular novel that frequently provokes strong reactions-both positive and negative-from its readers. In fact, The Catcher in the\r\nRye is one of the most widely read and discussed\r\nworks in the American literary canon. Despite its\r\nwidespread popularity and significant reputation,\r\nhowever, some critics argue that it is too vulgar,\r\nimmoral, and immature to be considered serious literature. Moreover, a few teachers and parents have\r\ncensored the novel because they feel that it will corrupt children who read it. While there are undoubtedly subversive, or corrupt elements in the\r\nnovel, arguments for censoring it generally misrepresent its more nobler intentions and greatly exaggerate its subversive designs. Putting aside the\r\noverinflated claims of the novel's most extreme\r\ncritics and supporters, the diversity and intensity of\r\nreaders' reactions to The Catcher in the Rye suggest that the issues it raises are significant ones.\r\nConsequently, it seems likely that readers will continue to have heated discussions about this &quot;minor&quot;\r\nclassic for a long time to come.\r\nOne of the issues that has been debated ever\r\nsince the novel's initial publication is whether or\r\nnot it qualifies as a significant work of literature.\r\nDoes it offer significant insights into the complexities of human existence and the development of\r\nAmerican culture, or does it simply appeal to vulgar adolescent minds with its obscene language,\r\ncomplaining about everything without developing\r\nany positive insights of its own? While some of the\r\ninitial reviews of The Catcher in the Rye were negative, critics later acknowledged it as a significant\r\nliterary work and demonstrated how the novel's\r\nnarrative structure, themes, and character development resemble other great works of literature. For\r\nexample, Arthur Heiserman and James E. Miller's\r\nessay, &quot;J. D. Salinger: Some Crazy Cliff,&quot; helped\r\nestablish the literary significance of The Catcher in\r\nthe Rye by showing how it belonged to the long\r\ntradition of epic quest narratives in westem literature. Similarly, Charles Kaplan's essay, &quot;Holden\r\nand Huck: The Odysseys of Youth,&quot; points out similarities between The Catcher in the Rye and Mark\r\nTwain's Huckleberry Finn. Both novels are about\r\na young man who tells the story of his own personal odyssey using his own comical wisdom and\r\ncolloquial everyday language. Critic Lilian Furst\r\ncompares The Catcher in the Rye to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novels in the Canadian\r\nReview of Comparative Literature. Helen Weinberg compares it to Franz Kafka's novels in The\r\nNew Novel in America while John M. Howell in\r\nhis essay &quot;Salinger in the Waste Land,&quot; compares\r\nit to T. S. Eliot's poetry.\r\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect about The\r\nCatcher in the Rye, however, is that it redefines the\r\nfocus of the literary text. Instead of focusing primarily on plot development like most traditional\r\nnovels, The Catcher in the Rye focuses more on\r\ncharacter development. In fact, most of the plot is\r\nmundane and uneventful; it only becomes interesting because Salinger makes the character of Holden\r\nand the perspective through which Holden narrates\r\nthe story interesting. Consequently, when reading\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye it is important to pay atten1 2 8 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\ntion to how Salinger represents Holden's character,\r\nlanguage, and world view. While some critics simply dismiss Holden's character as purely negative,\r\nvulgar, whining, and cynical, a more balanced reading of the novel could indicate that there is something more to Holden than his academic failures and\r\nadolescent cynicism: He is perceptive, sensitive,\r\ncreative, and even intelligent in his own way.\r\nThere are several ways that critics have attempted to describe Holden's positive characteristics, including rather obvious childlike innocence.\r\nThis quality is evident in a number of passages, including when Holden expresses his desire to be a\r\ncatcher in the rye who protects little children from\r\nfalling over the edge of a cliff, his fight with Stradlater for making sexual advances to Jane Gallagher,\r\nhis inability to have sex with a prostitute, and his\r\ntender dance with his sister. In his essay &quot;The Saint\r\nas a Young Man,&quot; Jonathan Baumbach, as other\r\ncritics have, notes that Holden acts like a saint or\r\nsavior of the innocent. It is this sensitive, innocent,\r\nand childlike side of Holden that makes him a complex and endearing character in spite of his vulgarity and immaturity.\r\nAnother way that critics have tried to show the\r\npositive side of Holden is by focusing on his demonstrated ability to use language creatively. After all,\r\nthe one course that Holden passes is English. Not\r\nonly does Holden write a good essay for himself but\r\nhe also writes a good one for his roommate Stradlater. In addition to writing, Holden is a natural actor and storyteller. He is often seen imitating his\r\nclassmates -or mimicking roles from the movies. In\r\nfact, A. Robert Lee goes so far as to argue in his\r\nessay &quot;Flunking Everything Else Except English\r\nAnyway&quot; that Holden continually performs himself\r\nby endlessly putting on a new mask and new identity for each new situation. In the train scene for example, Holden makes up stories about one of his\r\nclassmates in order to please his classmate's mother;\r\nhe not only adopts a new identity for himself, but\r\nhe also fabricates a whole new fictional history of\r\nlife at Pencey. Speaking is another area of importance. Even if Holden may not amount to much else,\r\nhe is always a smooth talker who can keep the reader\r\ninterested simply by the way in which he creatively\r\ntells his story using the vemacular slang that American teenagers used in the early 1950s.\r\nWhile such positive interpretations of Holden\r\ncorrect reductive interpretations that simply dismiss Holden as an immature cynic, Duane Edwards's essay, &quot;Holden Caulfield: Don't Ever Tell\r\nAnybody Anything,&quot; advances an even more complex interpretation of Holden. Instead of trying either to redeem Holden as a saint or to condemn him\r\nas a pessimist, Edwards argues that Holden is an\r\nironic character who critiques his phony culture but\r\nends up participating in the same phony culture that\r\nhe condemns. His argument becomes even more interesting when readers remember that Holden is the\r\nnovel's narrator. By making such an unorthodox\r\nand unreliable character as Holden the narrator,\r\nSalinger subtly suggests that maybe readers cannot\r\ncompletely trust everything Holden tells them\r\nabout himself and the world in which he lives. Obviously, the perspective of a cynical failure like\r\nHolden cannot be trusted completely as an accurate description of the way things really are, but\r\nneither can his compassionate wit be dismissed entirely. Consequently, the reader must always read\r\nbetween the lines like a detective looking for hints\r\nand clues that might help explain which of\r\nHolden's insights are valid and which are as phony\r\nas the phoniness he condemns.\r\nMoving beyond purely literary interpretations,\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye can also be interpreted from\r\nthe perspective of the social sciences. In particular,\r\nmany critics have advanced psychoanalytic interpretations of the novel because it repeatedly explores questions relating to death, sexuality, and\r\nprocesses of both psychological development and\r\npsychological breakdown. In general, these psychoanalytic interpretations usually try to get beneath the surface of Holden's psyche to discover\r\nsome hidden force that explains why Holden thinks\r\nand acts the way that he does. One way to uncover\r\nthe hidden layers of Holden's mind is to look back\r\non his childhood in order to find some significant\r\nor traumatic event that might explain his current\r\nstate of being. Clearly, one of the most traumatic,\r\nformative moments in Holden's childhood was the\r\ndeath of his brother Allie. Throughout the novel,\r\nHolden repeatedly thinks about his dead brother.\r\nFor example, when Holden agrees to write a paper\r\nfor his roommate Stradlater, he writes about Allie' s\r\nbaseball mitt. Or when Holden starts to have a\r\nbreakdown while walking around New York City,\r\nhe pleads in his mind with Allie to protect him. Perhaps as a result of this traumatic childhood experience involving death, Holden seems to be somewhat obsessed with it. For example, when Phoebe\r\nasks Holden to name people that he enjoys, the only\r\npeople other than Phoebe that he can think of are\r\nall dead: Allie and James Castle, a boy who died\r\nat Holden's school. This obsession with death,\r\ntherefore, might be one clue that can offer insight\r\ninto the inner workings of Holden's mind.\r\nV o I u m e I 1 2 9\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nAnother place where one might find clues about\r\nHolden's psychological make-up is in his relationships with other people and especially in his sexual\r\nor almost sexual relationships with women.\r\nThroughout the novel, Holden is continually obsessed with women, but he rarely does anything\r\nabout it. He likes Jane Gallagher, but they never get\r\nbeyond holding hands. He even orders a hooker to\r\nhis hotel room, but he decides that he only wants to\r\ntalk. Instead of developing sexual or even intimate\r\nrelationships with women, Holden seems to focus\r\nmost of his emotional energy on his younger sister,\r\nPhoebe. While some critics have interpreted this as\r\nevidence of Holden's repressed incestual desires\r\nand psychological immaturity, others have interpreted it as simply an affectionate bond between siblings that demonstrates Holden's innocence. While\r\nthe novel may not provide any definitive explanation of Holden's sexuality, sexuality is clearly an\r\nimportant and interesting aspect of his character.\r\nA final way to interpret The Catcher in the Rye\r\nis to read it from a sociological perspective. Instead\r\nof simply analyzing Holden's individual psychological make-up, a sociological analysis probes\r\ndeeper into the social and economic contexts that\r\nshape Holden's personality. Carol and Richard\r\nOhmann's essay, &quot;Reviewers, Critics, and The\r\nCatcher in the Rye,&quot; offers an excellent example\r\nof such an interpretation. In their Marxist analysis,\r\nthe Ohmanns argue that critics' narrow focus on\r\nmoral issues causes them to overlook how these\r\nmoral issues are related to broader social and economic contexts. By situating the novel in its\r\nbroader historical context at the beginning of the\r\ncold war, the Ohmanns argue that the novel is less\r\nabout the morality of Holden's internal psychological character than it is about the capitalist economic system that produces Holden's character. As\r\nthe Ohmanns point out, the people who Holden criticize are virtually all representatives of a corrupt\r\ncapitalist society: Mr. Haas is the phony headmaster who gets money for the school by kissing up to\r\nwealthy parents while ignoring poorer parents; Mr.\r\nOssenburger is the phony funeral parlor owner who\r\nmakes money off of personal tragedies; and the majority of Holden's classmates are simply the spoiled\r\nchildren of similar bourgeois money-grabbers. As\r\nthe Ohmanns demonstrate, Holden consistently directs his strongest criticisms against the evils of\r\ncapitalism: the commercialization of culture, classbased social hierarchies, exploitative sexuality,\r\nphony image-minded people, etc. From a socioeconomic perspective, therefore, The Catcher in the\r\nRye portrays the manners and follies of the rising\r\nAmerican bourgeois class during the post-World\r\nWar II era of rapid capitalist expansion, and Holden\r\nrepresents a sensitive social critic who reveals the\r\nevils of this phony bourgeois society.\r\nSource: Robert Bennett, in an essay for Novelsfor Students,\r\nGale, 1997.\r\nSusan K. Mitchell\r\nIn thefollowing excerpt, Mitchell considers the\r\nsignificance of Holden Caufield being an unreliable narrator.\r\nIn the work, Holden has analyzed his family\r\nas a representative slice of society and has concluded that adult society is phony and corrupt. But\r\ncan we really trust his observations of his family\r\nafter he has told us that he lies? Is he not, like the\r\nCretan who declared that all Cretans were liars, a\r\nperson declaring that all people are phony? If\r\neveryone is phony, then he is phony, too! Although\r\nHolden has claimed that he is a liar, he does not\r\nalways realize whether he is lying or telling the\r\ntruth. The distinctions between truth and falsehood\r\nbecome blurred as he often adds the phrase &quot;to tell\r\nyou the truth&quot; onto whatever he is saying. But does\r\nthis catch phrase ensure that his words are any more\r\ntruthful? This unambiguous rhetorical statement is\r\nrestated in an even more paradoxical way when\r\nHolden tells Sally that he loves her and then comments to the reader, &quot;It was a lie, of course, but the\r\nthing is, I meant it when I said it.&quot; Again we are\r\nforced to read the work, as de Man suggests [in his\r\nessay &quot;Semiology and Rhetoric,&quot; appearing in Contemporary Literary Criticism, edited by Robert C.\r\nDavis, 1986], in &quot;two entirely coherent but entirely\r\nincompatible&quot; ways. Is he lying, or does he &quot;mean&quot;\r\nit? First we may claim that Holden is telling the\r\ntruth: he is a liar, people are phony, society is corrupt. Or we may claim that Holden is lying: he is\r\ntruthful, people are genuine, and society is untainted.\r\nThere are obvious problems with both sides of\r\nthis paradox. Can Holden, people, and society be\r\nentirely unchanging-always lying, always corrupt, always phony? Or are there internal forces\r\nwithin each that cause them to change (un)willingly? Holden would argue that each is unchanging, labeled forever. In fact, this is how he presents\r\nhis information to us. He may go out with Sally,\r\nbut he does not harbor any hope that she will cast\r\noff her phoniness. He may loan Stradlater his coat,\r\nbut he still believes Stradlater is a phony.\r\nBecause we view all of the events in the book\r\nthrough the eyes of one narrator, our observations\r\n1 3 0 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nare necessarily biased. Holden is an unreliable narrator not only because he is a self-proclaimed liar\r\nbut also because he perceives reality in a simplistic way. In his work S/Z[1974], Roland Barthes outlines two ways of perceiving reality: readerly and\r\nwriterly. Barthes explains these ideas in terms of\r\nreading books. He claims that the only way to read\r\na different story is to reread the same book. By\r\nrereading, a person can learn how this book differs\r\nfrom itself rather than how it differs from other\r\nbooks. When a reader rereads a work, he is perceiving writerly. When a reader refuses to reread,\r\nBarthes maintains that he is condemned to &quot;read\r\nthe same story everywhere.&quot; Holden refuses to\r\nreread as he perceives reality readerly, seeing only\r\nthe surface differences between people, not the underlying differences within each person. To perceive a person readerly would be to perceive in\r\nterms of overt, easily distinguishable differences.\r\nBecause Holden avoids investigating deeply,\r\nhe sees the same story everywhere. Everyone is\r\nphony, he insists. But can we honestly believe him?\r\nIs he telling the truth? Even so, he is not passing\r\non false or limited information since he has not\r\ngone to the trouble to read one story well. To approach accuracy, Holden would have to perceive a\r\nperson writerly, to judge the fragmentation, the differences within the person, the covert, often contradictory intentions that war within and cause\r\novert actions. We can draw conclusions only from\r\nthe data which Holden perceives and selects to reveal to us (and he does select carefully as when he\r\nrefuses to discuss his childhood or his parents);\r\nhence, we must be astute readers indeed lest we\r\nmiss the multidimensionality of the characters that\r\nhe develops. His readerly perception creates blinkers for the reader.\r\nThroughout the novel, Holden tries to lull us\r\ninto accepting his view of surrounding life as he\r\nmakes statements that seem to make sense, but\r\nwhich, upon closer inspection, do not bear up to a\r\nwriterly view. This simplistic mode of perception\r\nis revealed particularly through his description of\r\nhis family. First of all, the Caulfield parents are described in such a way as to cause the blinkered\r\nreader to view them uncompromisingly as irresponsible, alienated, skittish parents. For example,\r\nthe parents are off at work away from their children, who are scattered throughout the country: D.\r\nB. in Hollywood, Allie dead, Phoebe at home, and\r\nHolden at Pencey Prep. Mr. and Mrs. Caulfield\r\nseem to be isolated characters. The reader never\r\nmeets Mr. Caulfield and only hears Mrs. Caulfield\r\nwhen Holden is hiding in Phoebe's room. Holden\r\nwill not tell much about his parents beyond his\r\nveiled opinion that they both are phony hypocrites.\r\nThe reader is not even told their first names. From\r\nthe beginning we are led to believe that they are\r\nhypersensitive about Holden's revealing their personal life because they want to protect their created\r\nimage of conformed perfection. Because Mrs.\r\nCaulfield is a nervous woman who has smoked\r\ncompulsively ever since Allie's death, Holden\r\navoids confrontation about his being kicked out of\r\nPencey Prep. He therefore hides from her as he\r\nstays in a hotel or in Mr. Antolini's apartment. Each\r\nof these examples appears to show that Mrs.\r\nCaulfield does not really communicate with her\r\nchildren. On the other hand, Mr. Caulfield is a\r\nlawyer. Holden makes no bones about his opinion\r\nof lawyers: they &quot;make a lot of dough and play golf\r\nand play bridge and buy cars and drink Martinis\r\nand look like a hot-shot&quot; and are phony but can't\r\nknow it.\r\nHolden's warped view of his parents denigrates them without even considering that the\r\nCaulfields may be blameless. Can we really trust\r\nHolden's view of his parents? Isn't he unethically\r\nstacking the deck so that we are prohibited from\r\nobtaining an objective view of them? We are given\r\nso few facts and scenes to describe them that we\r\nhave trouble refuting Holden, except that we know\r\nhe is holding something back from us. No couple\r\ncould merit such a denunciation from a son. If what\r\nhe has revealed about the Caulfields is true, carefully selected though the information may be, can\r\nwe blame them for their anger, hysteria, and desire\r\nfor privacy? These would be logical reactions if an\r\noffspring were so apathetic as to be kicked out of\r\nseveral reputable schools and then became anxious\r\nto write a book about his family while recovering\r\nfrom insanity. And what is wrong about working\r\nhard to support children, to enable them to have the\r\nbest education possible? What exactly is phony\r\nabout being a lawyer? Even though Holden's\r\nvagueness works well for him, making his parents\r\nappear base, mercenary, isolated, distant, and careless, it denies any redeeming qualities that would\r\nupset Holden's persuasive thesis that adult society\r\nis corrupt.\r\nAccording to Holden, D. B. represents wholehearted acceptance of society's norms. In Holden's\r\ncaustic terms, D. B. is a &quot;prostitute&quot; who lives in\r\nHollywood, where he makes buckets of money producing popular movies, such as the Annapolis love\r\nstory, which might prevent him from joining the\r\nfamily at Christmas. D. B. appears to symbolize the\r\nsuccessful all-American man since he lives in HolV o I u m e I 1 3 1\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nlywood, one of the most prestigious areas of the\r\ncountry, displays a noticeable sign of wealth by\r\nowning a Jaguar, and has a &quot;good-looking&quot; albeit\r\naffected English girlfriend. However, D. B.'s own\r\nname is revealing of both society's worst qualities\r\nand his embracing of its values. Like many of the\r\nmovies that he is writing, D. B.'s name is abbreviated, easy to remember, and void of significant\r\nmeaning. The very fact that D. B.'s name is compressed into two initials makes one wonder what\r\nlies behind them. Just as his name used to mean\r\nsomething, he used to have something to say. But\r\nnow as D. B. apparently bows to society's pressure\r\nand to his desire to pursue the American Dream,\r\nhe loses the meaning in his life and therefore cannot communicate the message he once had, the\r\nmessage he once published in his short story, &quot;The\r\nSecret Goldfish,&quot; one of Holden's favorites.\r\nAfter being bombarded with these loaded examples of D. B.'s phoniness, we must ask certain\r\nquestions to reveal whether Holden is right to condemn his brother. For instance, we should ask why\r\nit is wrong to display signs of wealth. Don't the\r\nsigns reveal a truth about D. B.-that he is indeed\r\nwealthy? Also, does his meaningless name necessarily mean that he has no message of truth and\r\nbeauty? D. B. is actually an unselfish, caring\r\nbrother, as demonstrated by his numerous visits\r\n(&quot;practically every week&quot;) with a recovering\r\nHolden. He does have other commitments, a girlfriend and work, that do keep him from devoting\r\nhimself wholeheartedly to his immediate family; it\r\nis to his credit that he finds as much time as he\r\ndoes to visit his family. However, to prove his thesis, Holden holds fast, emphasizing that because D.\r\nB. has rejected an accepted art form and taken up\r\nthe mass media that a technological society promotes, he has become visibly corrupt. But what is\r\nso corrupt about writing movies? Is it the medium\r\nthat makes the difference? Can paper itself be any\r\nmore artistic than celluloid? And is Holden really\r\nas against movies as he claims to be? If so, why\r\ndoes he volunteer to see so many? By seeing\r\nmovies, Holden embraces that which he says he rejects. Although he distinguishes between &quot;good&quot;\r\nmovies and &quot;lousy&quot; movies, he still claims that they\r\nare all phony. But what is the difference between\r\na good movie and a good book? Holden does not\r\nanswer our question. He doesn't follow his proclaimed norms; he is phony.\r\nIn Holden's readerly view, Allie represents immunity from the dangers of society. Allie is dead,\r\nescaped from the clutches of a culture that ultimately requires that children give up their innocence and individuality. Fascinated with Allie's solution to the problem, Holden defies him, preserving him in his memory by carrying Allie's uniquely\r\npoem-laden baseball mitt, praying aloud to him,\r\nand remembering his good-natured innocence. At\r\nthe beginning of the novel, Allie is Holden's ally,\r\nhis closest friend and kin. Holden wants to ally himself with Allie, to lie down, subside, become extinct, to simply leave this corrupted Eden. Throughout the novel, Holden contemplates physical death\r\nin innumerable scenes, such as when he writes\r\nabout Egyptian mummies in his history class, when\r\nhe asks what the ducks do during winter, and when\r\nhe remembers the suicide of James Castle.\r\nHowever, does he want to unite himself with\r\nAllie because Allie truly is perfectly pure, or simply to assuage free-floating feelings of guilt associated with Allie's death? His guilt seems to arise\r\nprimarily from an incident that occurred when Allie was alive. Holden and a friend decided to have\r\na picnic and shoot their BB guns, and Allie wanted\r\nto go with them. However, Holden called him a\r\nchild and would not let him come along. Now that\r\nAllie is dead, whenever Holden gets depressed, he\r\ndoes penance, telling Allie out loud, &quot;Okay. Go\r\nhome and get your bike and meet me in front of\r\nBobby's house. Hurry up.&quot; Holden's recurring feelings of guilt distort his (and our) image of Allie.\r\nDid Holden refuse to allow Allie to join him on the\r\nexpedition because Allie was not perfect? Looking\r\nback on the incident, Holden states, &quot;[Allie] didn't\r\nget sore about it-he never got sore about anything-but I keep thinking about it anyway, when\r\nI get very depressed.&quot; Or was Holden the guilty\r\nparty by refusing without a good reason to allow\r\nAllie to come along? In his guilt, Holden paints Allie larger than life.\r\nPhoebus, the name of Apollo, means the genius of poetry. This association is not lost on\r\nPhoebe as she writes a synthesized gothic-detective\r\nthriller in which her protagonist, Hazle Weatherfield, is an orphan detective who has a father.\r\nHolden believes that Phoebe is also an orphan who\r\nhas parents, but because they are alienated, they do\r\nnot offer the example, guidance, and support that\r\ntrue parents should. Of course Holden proves this\r\nneglect as he chooses to tell us that although\r\nPhoebe is to play Benedict Arnold in &quot;A Christmas\r\nPageant for Americans,&quot; her father plans to fly to\r\nCalifornia on that day anyway. Also, her mother,\r\ninstead of lecturing Phoebe when she admits to\r\nsmoking, simply closes the subject with the irrelevant question &quot;Do you want another blanket?&quot; Because Phoebe is still young and alive, Holden trans1 3 2 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nfers many of his guilt feelings about Allie to her,\r\ncausing her to grow, in Holden's perception, more\r\nand more innocent and uncorrupted. She trusts\r\nHolden wholly as she gives him her Christmas\r\nmoney and packs a suitcase to run away with him.\r\nIn spite of his guilt over Allie, he commits the same\r\nguilt-inducing act with Phoebe as he refuses to allow her to accompany him on the new expedition.\r\nAs pure as Holden makes Phoebe appear, she\r\nhas a wisdom that belies her years. She shrewdly\r\nsees through Holden's facade of well-being, realizing that he doesn't like anything. When she tests\r\nhim to prove her theory, he cannot name anything\r\n&quot;really&quot; that he likes. She is also a very literate\r\nyoung lady. She is able to identify Holden's song\r\nas belonging to Robert Bum's poem and to correct\r\nthe miswording in it. She perceives reality writerly,\r\nas shown when she writes the same story over and\r\nover again. When her mother smells smoke and assumes that Phoebe has been smoking cigarettes,\r\nPhoebe is too quick-she, like Holden, lies about\r\nthe truth, saying that she only took one puff of the\r\ncigarette when it was actually Holden who had been\r\nsmoking. Again, when Mrs. Caulfield complains of\r\na headache, Phoebe promptly supplies the remedy:\r\n&quot;Take a few aspirins.&quot; Does Phoebe's covert wisdom support Holden's premise that society is corrupt? Does the thesis prove truer than he wants it\r\nto be? Holden wants to hold out for children, to\r\nproclaim their Edenic innocence. However, his\r\nflawed readerly perception blinds him to the\r\nwriterly truth: not all is as easily categorizable as\r\nit appears.\r\nNaturally, Holden is the only character shown\r\nto be heroically struggling with exactly how to relate to society. He is locked into a self that desires\r\nto be genuine but finds no way to return to the pastoral ideal. He believes that he is holed in, trapped\r\nby the games of phoniness that society requires its\r\ncitizens to play. He tries to escape this trap by\r\nflunking out of school and by searching for a quiet\r\nretreat, only to discover that there is no pure retreat\r\non earth-log cabins are distant and lonely, deserted museum rooms are corrupted with permanent obscenities, private hotel rooms lure prostitutes and pimps. Frustrated by the readerly\r\nevidence which he has gathered to support his thesis, Holden is himself fragmented and ravaged by\r\nthe warring forces within him. For instance, within\r\nHolden, the desire to reject others conflicts with the\r\ndesire to be accepted by others; he doesn't want to\r\nlend Stradlater his coat, but his overt actions belie\r\nthis covert, warring want; he despises Ackely, but\r\nhe invites him to see a movie; he hates movies, believing them to foster phoniness in society, but during the three days of the book he sees or talks about\r\nseveral; he craves truth, but he tells blatant lies. Despite his own inherent writerliness or differences\r\nwithin, Holden still perceives only readerly. He\r\nviews himself as a liar, but he refuses to acknowledge that this means that he is phony, too....\r\nWhat does this mean for us? What is Salinger\r\ntrying to prove? Perhaps by making Holden unreliably readerly, he is saying that society is both\r\nphony and necessary. Holden's unreliability forces\r\nus to question everything about the subject:\r\nHolden's view, society's view, our own view as\r\nreaders. The apparently stable themes are radically\r\nunstable; Holden does change, and society can, too,\r\nfor society is neither entirely phony nor wholly pastoral. Instead, it is both one and the other. It cannot be placed in a fixed category since it is writerly.\r\n[Although some critics believe] that there is a\r\ncoherent, knowable meaning of a work, they refuse\r\nto analyze why the meaning varies so radically\r\nfrom one critic to the next. Of course, some of them\r\nwould rationalize that one critic may not be as intelligent or educated as another. This is possible but\r\ndoes not really answer the fundamental question\r\nsatisfactorily. Therefore the meaning is ultimately\r\nundecidable. Since this is a writerly text, a text that\r\nsplits down the middle into positive and negative\r\nfactions, the ultimate meaning of it is undecidable.\r\nThe reader's expectations of having an orderly, coherent world of meaning are unraveled by the\r\nthread that holds the work together. Salinger places\r\nhis story en abyme, to use [J. Hillis] Miller's term\r\n[as quoted from &quot;Stevens' Rock and Criticism as\r\nCure, II,&quot; in Georgia Review, 1976], so that it becomes undecidable. Society now appears genuine,\r\nnow phony, now genuine again, and so on endlessly. There is an endless freeplay of meaning because the book lacks a genuine center-the apparent center of the book is actually phony. Therefore,\r\nthe meaning of The Catcher in the Rye can never\r\nbe totalized.\r\nSource: Susan K. Mitchell, &quot;To Tell You the Truth...&quot; in\r\nCLA Journal, Vol. 36, No. 2, December, 1992, pp. 145-56.\r\nJonathan Baumbach\r\nIn the following excerpt, Baumbach explores\r\nthe meaning of &quot;innocence&quot; in The Catcher in the\r\nRye.\r\nJ. D. Salinger's first and only novel, The\r\nCatcher in the Rye (1951), has undergone in recent\r\nyears a steady if overinsistent devaluation. The\r\nmore it becomes academically respectable, the\r\nV o I u me I 1 3 3\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nmore it becomes fair game for those critics who are\r\nself-sworn to expose every manifestation of what\r\nseems to them a chronic disparity between appearance and reality. It is critical child's play to find\r\nfault with Salinger's novel. Anyone can see that the\r\nprose is mannered (the pejorative word for stylized); no one actually talks like its first-person hero\r\nHolden Caulfield. Moreover, we are told that\r\nHolden, as poor little rich boy, is too precocious\r\nand specialized an adolescent for his plight to have\r\nlarger-than-prepschool significance. The novel is\r\nsentimental; it loads the deck for Holden and\r\nagainst the adult world; the small but corrupt group\r\nthat Holden encounters is not representative enough\r\nto permit Salinger his inclusive judgments about\r\nthe species. Holden's relationship to his family is\r\nnot explored: we meet his sister Phoebe, who is a\r\nyounger version of himself, but his father never appears, and his mother exists in the novel only as\r\nanother voice from a dark room. Finally, what is\r\nHolden (or Salinger) protesting against but the ineluctability of growing up, of having to assume the\r\nprerogatives and responsibilities of manhood? Despite these objections to the novel, Catcher in the\r\nRye will endure both because it has life and because it is a significantly original work, full of insights into at least the particular truth of Holden's\r\nexistence. Within the limited terms of its vision,\r\nSalinger's small book is an extraordinary achievement; it is, if such a distinction is meaningful, an\r\nimportant minor novel.\r\nLike all of Salinger's fiction, Catcher in the\r\nRye is not only about innocence, it is actively for\r\ninnocence-as if retaining one's childness were an\r\nexistential possibility. The metaphor of the titleHolden's fantasy-vision of standing in front of a\r\ncliff and protecting playing children from falling\r\n(Falling)-is, despite the impossibility of its realization, the only positive action affirmed in the\r\nnovel. It is, in Salinger's Manichean universe of\r\nchild angels and adult &quot;phonies,&quot; the only moral\r\nalternative-otherwise all is corruption. Since it is\r\nspiritually as well as physically impossible to prevent the Fall, Salinger's idealistic heroes are\r\ndoomed either to suicide (Seymour) or insanity\r\n(Holden, Sergeant X) or mysticism (Franny), the\r\nways of sainthood, or to moral dissolution (Eloise,\r\nD. B., Mr. Antolini), the way of the world. In\r\nSalinger's finely honed prose, at once idiomatically\r\nreal and poetically stylized, we get the terms of\r\nHolden's ideal adult occupation:\r\nAnyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing\r\nsome game in this big field of rye and aUl. Thousands\r\nof little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I\r\nmean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of\r\nsome crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch\r\neverybody if they start to go over the cliff-I mean\r\nif they're running and they don't look where they're\r\ngoing I have to come out from somewhere and catch\r\nthem. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher\r\nin the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the\r\nonly thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.\r\nApparently Holden's wish is purely selfless.\r\nWhat he wants, in effect, is to be a saint-the protector and savior of innocence. But what he also\r\nwants, for he is still one of the running children\r\nhimself, is that someone prevent his fall. This is his\r\nparadox: he must leave innocence to protect innocence. At sixteen, he is ready to shed his innocence\r\nand move like Adam into the fallen adult world,\r\nbut he resists because those no longer innocent\r\nseem to him foolish as well as corrupt. In a sense,\r\nthen, he is looking for an exemplar, a wise-good\r\nfather whose example will justify his own initiation into manhood. Before Holden can become a\r\ncatcher in the rye, he must find another catcher in\r\nthe rye to show him how it is done.\r\nImmediately after Holden announces his\r\n&quot;crazy&quot; ambition to Phoebe, he calls up one of his\r\nformer teachers, Mr. Antolini, who is both intelligent and kind-a potential catcher in the rye.\r\nHe was the one that finally picked up that boy that\r\njumped out of the window I told you about, James\r\nCastle. Old Mr. Antolini felt his pulse and aUl, and\r\nthen he took off his coat and put it over James Castle and carried him all the way over to the infirmary.\r\nThough Mr. Antolini is sympathetic because\r\n&quot;he didn't even give a damn if his coat got all\r\nbloody,&quot; the incident is symbolic of the teacher's\r\nfailure as a catcher in the rye. For all his good intentions, he was unable to catch James Castle or\r\nprevent his fall; he could only pick him up after he\r\nhad died. The episode of the suicide is one of the\r\nlooming shadows darkening Holden's world;\r\nHolden seeks out Antolini because he hopes that\r\nthe gentle teacher-the substitute father-will\r\n&quot;pick him up&quot; before he is irrevocably fallen.\r\nHolden's real quest throughout the novel is for a\r\nspiritual father (an innocent adult). He calls Antolini after all the other fathers of his world have\r\nfailed him, including his real father, whose existence in the novel is represented solely by Phoebe's\r\nchildish reiteration of &quot;Daddy's going to kill you.&quot;\r\nThe fathers in Salinger's child's-eye world do not\r\ncatch falling boys-who have been thrown out of\r\nprep school-but &quot;kill&quot; them. Antolini represents\r\nHolden's last chance to find a catcher-father. But\r\nhis inability to save Holden has been prophesied in\r\nhis failure to save James Castle; the episode of Cas1 3 4 N o v e I s f o r S t u d e n t s\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\ntie's death provides an anticipatory parallel to Antolini's unwitting destruction of Holden.\r\nThat Antolini's kindness to Holden is motivated in part by a homosexual interest, though it\r\ncomes as a shock to Holden, does not wholly surprise the reader. Many of the biographical details\r\nthat Salinger has revealed about him through\r\nHolden imply this possibility. For example, that he\r\nhas an older and unattractive wife whom he makes\r\na great show of kissing in public is highly suggestive; yet the discovery itself-Holden wakes to find\r\nAntolini sitting beside him and caressing his\r\nhead-has considerable impact. We experience a\r\nkind of shock of recognition, the more intense for\r\nits having been anticipated. The scene has added\r\npower because Antolini is, for the most part, a good\r\nman, whose interest in Holden is genuine as well\r\nas perverted. His advice to Holden is apparently\r\nwell-intentioned. Though many of his recommendations are cleverly articulated platitudes, Antolini\r\nevinces a prophetic insight when he tells Holden,\r\n&quot;I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind\r\nof a terrible, terrible fall&quot;; one suspects, however,\r\nthat to some extent he is talking about himself. Ironically, Antolini becomes the agent of his &quot;terrible,\r\nterrible fall&quot; by violating Holden's image of him,\r\nby becoming a false father. Having lost his respect\r\nfor Antolini as a man, Holden rejects him as an authority; as far as Holden is concemed, Antolini's\r\nexample denies the import of his words. His disillusionment with Antolini, who had seemed to be\r\nthe sought-for, wise-good father, comes as the most\r\nintense of a long line of disenchantments; it is the\r\nfinal straw that breaks Holden. It is the equivalent\r\nof the loss of God. The world, devoid of good fathers (authorities), becomes a soul-destroying\r\nchaos in which his survival is possible only through\r\nwithdrawal into childhood, into fantasy, into psychosis....\r\nObliquely searching for good in the adult\r\nworld, or at least something to mitigate his despair,\r\nHolden is continually confronted with the absence\r\nof good. On his arrival in the city, he is disturbed\r\nbecause his cabdriver is corrupt and unsociable and,\r\nworst of all, unable to answer Holden's obsessional\r\nquestion: where do the Central Park ducks go when\r\nthe lake freezes over? What Holden really wants to\r\nknow is whether there is a benevolent authority that\r\ntakes care of ducks. If there is one for ducks, it follows that there may be one for people as well.\r\nHolden's quest for a wise and benevolent authority, then, is essentially a search for a God-principle. However, none of the adults in Holden's world\r\nhas any true answers for him. When he checks into\r\na hotel room, he is depressed by the fact that the\r\nbellboy is an old man (&quot;What a gorgeous job for a\r\nguy around sixty-five years old&quot;). As sensitized\r\nrecorder of the moral vibrations of his world,\r\nHolden suffers the indignity of the aged bellhop's\r\nsituation for him, as he had suffered for Spencer's\r\nguilt and Ackley's self-loathing. Yet, and this is\r\npart of his tragedy, he is an impotent saint, unable\r\neither to redeem the fallen or to prevent their fall....\r\nAfter his disillusionment with Antolini, who is\r\nthe most destructive of Holden' s fathers because he\r\nis seemingly the most benevolent, Holden suffers\r\nan emotional breakdown. His flight from Antolini's\r\nhouse, like his previous flights from school and\r\nfrom the hotel, is an attempt to escape evil. The\r\nthree are parallel experiences, except that Holden\r\nis less sure of the justness of his third flight and\r\nwonders if he has not misjudged his otherwise sympathetic teacher.\r\nAnd the more I thought about it, the more depressed\r\nI got. I mean I started thinking maybe I should've\r\ngone back to his house. Maybe he was only patting\r\nmy head just for the hell of it. The more I thought\r\nabout it, though, the more depressed and screwed up\r\nabout it I got.\r\nThe ambivalence of his response racks him. If\r\nhe has misjudged Antolini, he has wronged not only\r\nhis teacher, but he has wronged himself as well; he,\r\nnot Antolini, has been guilty of corruption. Consequently, he suffers both for Antolini and for himself. Holden's guilt-ridden despair manifests itself\r\nin nausea and in an intense sense of physical illbeing, as if he carries the whole awful corruption\r\nof the city inside him. Walking aimlessly through\r\nthe Christmas-decorated city, Holden experiences\r\n&quot;the terrible, terrible fall&quot; that Antolini had prophesied for him.\r\nEvery time I came to the end of a block and stepped\r\noff the goddam curb, I had this feeling that I'd never\r\nget to the other side of the street. I thought I'd go\r\ndown, down, down, and nobody'd ever see me again.\r\nBoy, did it scare me. You can't imagine. I started\r\nsweating like a bastard-my whole shirt and underwear and everything.... Every time I'd get to the end\r\nof a block I'd make believe I was talking to my\r\nbrother Allie. I'd say to him, &quot;Allie, don't let me disappear. Allie, don't let me disappear. Allie, don't let\r\nme disappear. Please, Allie.&quot; And then when I'd\r\nreach the other side of the street without disappearing, I'd thank him.\r\nLike Franny's prayer to Jesus in one of\r\nSalinger's later stories, Holden's prayer to Allie is\r\nnot so much an act of anguish as an act of love,\r\nthough it is in part both. Trapped in an interior hell,\r\nHolden seeks redemption, not by formal appeal to\r\nGod or Jesus, who have in the Christmas season\r\nV o I u m e I 1 3 5\r\nT h e C a t c h e r i n t h e R y e\r\nbeen falsified and commercialized, but by praying\r\nto his saint-brother who in his goodness had God\r\nin him.\r\nLike so many heroes of contemporary fiction-Morris' Boyd, Ellison's Invisible Man,\r\nMalamud's Frank, Salinger's Seymour-Holden is\r\nan impotent savior. Because he can neither save his\r\nevil world nor live in it as it is, he retreats into fantasy-into childhood. He decides to become a deafmute, to live alone in an isolated cabin, to commit\r\na kind of symbolic suicide. It is an unrealizable fantasy, but a death wish nevertheless. However,\r\nHolden's social conscience forces him out of spiritual retirement. When he discovers an obscenity\r\nscrawled on one of the walls of Phoebe's school,\r\nhe rubs it out with his hand to protect the innocence\r\nof the children. For the moment he is a successful\r\ncatcher in the rye. But then he discovers another\r\nsuch notice, &quot;scratched on, with a knife or something,&quot; and then another. He realizes that he cannot possibly erase all the scribbled obscenities in\r\nthe world, that he cannot catch all the children, that\r\nevil is ineradicable.\r\nThis is the final disillusionment. Dizzy with\r\nhis terrible awareness, Holden insults Phoebe when\r\nshe insists on running away with him. In his vision\r\nof despair, he sees Phoebe's irrevocable doom as\r\nwell as his own, and for a moment he hates her as\r\nhe hates himself-as he hates the world. Once he\r\nhas hurt her, however, he realizes the commitment\r\nthat his love for her imposes on him; if he is to assuage her pain, he must continue to live in the\r\nworld. When she kisses him as a token of forgiveness and love and, as if in consequence, it begins\r\nto rain, Holden, bathed by the rain, is purified-in\r\na sense, redeemed.\r\nA too literal reading of Holden's divulgence\r\nthat he is telling the story from some kind of rest\r\nhome has led to a misinterpretation of the end of\r\nthe novel. Holden is always less insane than his\r\nworld. The last scene, in which Holden, suffused\r\nwith happiness, sits in the rain and watches Phoebe\r\nride on the merry-go-round, is indicative not of his\r\ncrack-up, as has been assumed, but of his redemption. Whereas all the adults in his world have failed\r\nhim (and he, a butter-fingered catcher in the rye,\r\nhas failed them), a ten-year-old girl saves himbecomes his catcher. Love is the redemptive grace.\r\nPhoebe replaces Jane, the loss of whom had initiated Holden's despair, flight, and quest for experience as salvation. Holden's pure communion with\r\nPhoebe may be construed as a reversion to childlike innocence, but this is the only way to redemption in Salinger's world-there is no other\r\ngood. Innocence is all. Love is innocence.\r\nThe last scene, with Holden drenched in Scott\r\nFitzgerald's all-absolving rain, seems unashamedly\r\nsentimental. Certainly Salinger overstates the spiritually curative powers of children; innocence can\r\nbe destructive as well as redemptive. Yet Salinger's\r\nview of the universe, in which all adults (even the\r\nmost apparently decent) are corrupt and consequently destructive, is bleak and somewhat terrifying. Since growing up in the real world is tragic,\r\nin Salinger's ideal world time must be stopped to\r\nprevent the loss of childhood, to salvage the remnants of innocence. At one point in the novel,\r\nHolden wishes that life were as changeless and pure\r\nas the exhibitions under glass cases in the Museum\r\nof Natural History. This explains, in part, Holden's\r\necstasy in the rain at the close of the novel. In\r\nwatching Phoebe go round and round on the carrousel, in effect going nowhere, he sees her in the\r\ntimeless continuum of art on the verge of changing, yet unchanging, forever safe, forever loving,\r\nforever innocent.\r\nSource: Jonathan Baumbach, &quot;The Saint as a Young Man:\r\nA Reappraisal of The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; in Modem Language Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4, December, 1964, pp. 461-\r\n72.\r\nJames Bryan, &quot;The Psychological Structure of The Catcher\r\nin the Rye,&quot; PMLA: Publications of the Modem Language\r\nAssociation, Vol. 89, no. 5, 1974, pp. 1065-74.\r\nNash K.
