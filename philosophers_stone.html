C . B ., D . C . L ., LL . D .\r\nPRINCIPAL LIBRARIAN OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM\r\nDEAR SIR EDWARD,\r\nWith great pleasure I avail myself of the opportunity of inscribing your name at the head of this\r\nwork on the Theban Recension of the Book of the\r\nDead, for you have taken no ordinary interest in its\r\ninception, and progress, and completion . I do it the\r\nmore gladly because I know that everything which\r\nconcerns the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians\r\nand the wonderful doctrine of the resurrection of the\r\nspiritual body and of its everlasting existence, which\r\nthey evolved thousands of years before our era, has\r\nthe greatest attraction for you . It is now many years\r\nago since your friendship with our common friend the\r\nlate Prof. W. Wright began, and your helpful sympathy with his various Oriental works was never wanting ; the like friendship and the like sympathy you\r\nhave extended to myself his pupil . For both I thank\r\nyou, and I subscribe myself,\r\nGratefully yours,\r\nE . A. WALLIS BUDGE.\r\nLONDON, July 27th, X897 .\r\nPREFACE.\r\nThe present volume forms part of a work on the\r\nTheban Recension of the Book of the Dead, which I\r\nhave prepared for Messrs . Kegan Paul and Co . with\r\na view of supplying an edition of the Egyptian text\r\nin hieroglyphic, a full Vocabulary to the same with\r\ncopious references, and a complete translation, with\r\nintroductory chapters upon the history, object and\r\ncontents of the Book of the Dead, in a handy form\r\nand at a moderate price . It is the most complete edition of the Theban Recension hitherto published, but\r\nfuture discoveries in Egypt may at any moment result in the recovery of papyri containing Chapters at\r\npresent unknown to us .\r\nThe texts of the Heliopolitan Recension of the Book\r\nof the Dead of the fifth and sixth dynasties, which are\r\ninscribed upon the Pyramids of Unas, Teta, Pepi I .,\r\nMer-en-Rd, and Pepi II, and which may be regarded as\r\nthe most ancient form of the work now known to us,\r\nhave been published, together with French translations\r\nVIII PREFACE.\r\nof them, by M. Maspero in the various volumes of\r\nRecueil de Travaux, and separately under the title\r\nof Les Inscriptions des Pyramides de Saggarah, Paris,\r\n1894 . The texts of the Recension in use during the\r\neleventh and twelfth dynasties, which are found inscribed upon the coffins of the period, have been\r\npublished by Lepsius and Maspero, and an excellent\r\nidea of their contents may be gained from Birch's translation of the text on the coffin of Amamu, published\r\nwith a complete facsimile by the Trustees of the British\r\nMuseum under the title Egyptian Texts of the earliest\r\nperiod from the coffin of Amamu, London, 1886 . The\r\ntexts of the Theban Recension, which was in use from\r\nthe eighteenth to the twenty-second dynasty, i . e ., from\r\nabout B . C. i 6oo to B . C. goo, and which is found inscribed on several papyri, both plain and illuminated,\r\nhave been published by Birch, Mariette, Leemans, Deveria and others, and an eclectic edition of the Recension in use from the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasty\r\nwas published with variants and Einleitung by M. Naville in 1886 . Translations of single papyri belonging\r\nto this period have been published by Deveria and\r\nPierret, Guieyesse, Lefebure, Massey, Pleyte, and\r\nothers, and certain Chapters of this Recension have\r\nbeen translated and discussed by various Egyptologists . Texts, both hieratic and hieroglyphic, which\r\nPREFACE,.\r\n\r\nIX\r\nwere copied and illustrated for the priests and priestesses of Amen during the twenty-first and twentysecond dynasties, have been published by Birch, Leemans, Lepsius, Mariette, and Maspero, and a fine\r\nexample of the hieratic MS . of the period following,\r\nentitled Rituel Funcsraire, was published by E . de Rouge'\r\nin 1861 . Of the texts which represent the Saite\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead, several MSS.\r\nhave been printed and described . The most important\r\nof these, however, is the famous papyrus preserved\r\nat Turin, of which Lepsius published a good copy as\r\nfar back as 1842 entitled Das Todtenbuch der Aegypter.\r\nThe Book of the Dead which was in use throughout the Graeco-Roman and Roman periods is well\r\nillustrated by the hieratic texts published and translated by Birch in the Proceedings of the Society of\r\nBiblical Archaeology, vol. VII, p. 49 ff., and by Lieblein in his Le Livre Egyptien Que moll 110M elfri'sse,\r\nLeipzig, 1895 .\r\nThe first to publish a complete translation of any\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead was Birch, who\r\nin 1867 gave an English version of the Turin papyrus\r\nin the fifth volume of Bunsen, Egypt's Place in Universal History, pp . 123-333 . Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the Recension here translated is the Saite or\r\nlatest of all, and that the text of the Turin MS . is\r\nX\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\nfaulty in many places, Birch's rendering gave a new\r\nimpulse to the study of the Egyptian religion, and it\r\nhas formed the groundwork of the translations made\r\nby Egyptologists subsequently. The thing to wonder\r\nat is not the mistakes which he made, but that he\r\nwas able, at that early date, to translate so much\r\ncorrectly . In 1882 Pierret published a French translation of the Turin Papyrus entitled Le Livre des Morts\r\ndes anciens J.oyptiens, and in 1894 Davis published an\r\nEnglish version of Pierret's French translation at New\r\nYork. Up to the present, however, no complete translation of the Theban Recension has appeared . Translations of single papyri, e . g ., the Papyrus of Nebseni,\r\nthe Papyrus of Ani, the Papyrus of Sutimes, the Papyrus\r\nof Neb-qed, etc ., have been made by Deveria and\r\nPierret, Guieyesse, Massey, myself, and others ; and\r\na translation of the texts published by Naville in his\r\n7odtenbnch, and by others, was begun by Renouf in\r\nthe Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,\r\nVol. XIV.\r\nSince the appearance of Naville's great work in\r\n1886 several extremely important papyri have been\r\ndiscovered, and it is now possible to add to the texts\r\nof the Theban Recension which he published a considerable number of Chapters, etc . From the Papyrus\r\nof Ani we obtain Introductions to Chapters XVIII and\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXI\r\nCXXV, a hymn to Ra, a hymn to Osiris, texts referring to the judgment Scene, all of which are new ;\r\nbesides these we gain from it a complete, though\r\nshort, version of Chapter CLXXV, and the Vignettes\r\nare coloured with a care and beauty hitherto unknown\r\nin papyri of this class . Of greater interest textually,\r\nhowever, is the Papyrus of Nu, which the Trustees\r\nof the British Museum acquired in i 890 . It is, I believe, the oldest of illuminated papyri known, and it\r\ncertainly was written in the first half of the period of\r\nthe rule of the kings of the eighteenth dynasty ; it is\r\nnearly, if not quite, as old as the famous papyrus of\r\nNebseni . Unlike many of the papyri of that date it\r\nwas written throughout by one man, probably Nu\r\nhimself. As in all papyri lines are omitted here and\r\nthere, and one short Chapter is repeated ; in it, however, are about twenty Chapters of the Theban Recension which have not hitherto been found, and\r\nseveral which have, up to the present, been only\r\nknown to exist in single manuscripts .\r\nFrom the above facts it is clear that an edition of\r\nthe texts of the Theban Recension which should contain all such new Chapters, etc ., was needed. When\r\na few years ago Sir F . Maunde Thompson suggested\r\nto me to make a translation of the Book of the Dead\r\nfor popular use I decided to do so, and to publish\r\nXII PREFACE.\r\nat the same time an edition of the Egyptian texts ;\r\nfor in these days the reader insists, and rightly, upon\r\nthe reproduction of the original documents as far as\r\npossible, so that he may be able to control the renderings set forth by the translator. Since no papyrus\r\ncontains all the Chapters of the Theban Recension,\r\nand no two papyri agree either in respect of contents\r\nor arrangement of the Chapters, and the critical\r\nvalue of every text in a papyrus is not always the\r\nsame, it follows that a complete edition of all the\r\nknown Chapters of the Theban Recension is impossible\r\nunless recourse be had to several papyri . I have\r\ntherefore made use of several, and as a result translations of about 16o Chapters, not including different\r\nversions, hymns and rubrics, are given in the present\r\nvolume ; I have also added translations of 16 Chapters\r\nof the Saite Recension, both because they form good\r\nspecimens of the religious compositions of the later\r\nperiod and illustrate some curious beliefs, and because,\r\nhaving adopted the numbering of the Chapters employed by Lepsius, they were needed to make the\r\nnumbering of the Chapters in this edition consecutive .\r\nMy translation has been made as literal as possible,\r\nmy aim being to let the reader judge for himself the\r\ncontents of the Theban Book of the Dead . As it is\r\nintended for popular use I have not encumbered the\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\npages with voluminous notes, nor have I attempted\r\nto explain the allusions and obscurities which no man,\r\nat present, understands . For references to the works\r\nof other writers the reader is referred to the Bibliography at the end of my Papyrus of Ani in the British Museum, London, 1895, and to the notes in the\r\nIntroduction to that work . The source of each Chapter is set forth clearly above it, together with a description of the Vignette to it as it is found in the\r\nbest papyri of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties . Since the Vignettes formed originally no part of\r\nthe Book of the Dead, no attempt has been made\r\nto reproduce them here ; a collection of all the Vignettes found in the Theban papyri, especially those\r\nwhich are found in the Books of the Dead made for\r\nthe priests of Amen after B . C. iooo, would be of\r\ngreat value, but, unless they were reproduced in their\r\nactual colours, much of their interest would be lost .\r\nThe whole judgment Scene, and the Elysian Fields,\r\nand a portion of the Vignette to the first Chapter\r\nhave, however, been beautifully reproduced in full\r\ncolours by Mr. W. Griggs from the Papyrus of Ani,\r\nand these form excellent examples of the artistic work\r\nexecuted upon papyri in the eighteenth dynasty ; those\r\nwho require other examples are referred to the second\r\nedition of the coloured facsimile of the Papyrus of\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\nAni published by the Trustees of the British Museum\r\nin 1894.\r\nIn the Introduction a sketch of the history of the\r\ngrowth and development of the Book of the Dead\r\nhas been given, and to illustrate the palaeography\r\nof the different Recensions, from about B . C . 3500 to\r\nabout A. D . Zoo, eighteen plates have been appended .\r\nThe remaining brief accounts of some of the religious\r\nviews of the Egyptians are necessary for the understanding of the aim and object of the Book of the\r\nDead ; they would have been fuller had space permitted, and I reserve a more detailed description of\r\nthem for a future work on the Egyptian Religion .\r\nWith the view of shewing how, in the Ptolemaic period\r\nand later times, the Egyptians hoped to obtain for\r\ntheir dead all the benefits which were believed to be\r\nsecured for them by the use of the numerous Chapters of earlier periods, by means of a work which,\r\nthough extremely short, preserved all the essential beliefs of the olden time, a translation has been added\r\nof the \"Book of Breathings\" from the text of the Papyrus of Kerasher (Brit . Mus. No. 9995). By means of\r\nthis and the extracts from the Pyramid Texts given\r\nin my chapter on the Elysian Fields a comparison of\r\nthe beliefs of the Egyptians in the earliest and latest\r\ntimes can be made.\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nXV\r\nIn a small volume accompanying the text of the Theban Recension will be found a Vocabulary, containing\r\nover 35,000 references, which has been bound up separately in deference to the wishes of many . In the\r\ncase of uncommon words every example of its use\r\nwhich occurs in the book is noted ; for commoner\r\nwords copious references are given in order that the\r\nreader may the more easily compare their meanings\r\nin several passages.\r\nFinally it is my duty to express my grateful thanks\r\nto the Trustees of the British Museum for permission\r\nto print certain Chapters of the Papyrus of Nebseni\r\nand of the Papyrus of Ani from the publications issued\r\nby them. My thanks are also due to Mr . Holzhausen\r\nof Vienna for the care which he has bestowed upon\r\nthe printing of the three parts of this work, and to\r\nMr . Griggs for the coloured reproductions from the\r\nPapyrus of Ani which he has executed with his usual\r\nskill .\r\nE. A. WALLIS BUDGE.\r\nLONDON, August 19th, 1897 .\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\nI .

The Egyptians embalmed their dead either\r\nbecause they wished to keep their material bodies with\r\nthem upon earth, or because they believed that the\r\nfuture welfare of the departed depended in some way\r\nupon the preservation of the bodies which they had\r\nleft behind them upon earth . Whatever the motive,\r\nit is quite certain that it must have been a very powerful one, for the custom of embalming the dead lasted\r\nin Egypt without a break for at least five thousand\r\nyears . It survived all the influence which the Greeks\r\nXXXVII I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nand Romans brought to bear upon the habits and\r\ncustoms of the Egyptians, and only disappeared from\r\nthe country about two hundred years before its conquest by Muhammad's general `Amr ibn al-`Asi, A. D .\r\n658 . The writings of ancient Egypt shew that it was\r\nnot only the custom, but also the duty of a man to\r\nprepare during his life-time a suitable tomb in which\r\nhis body might rest after death, and it is to the desire\r\nof preserving the body on the part of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich found practical expression in the hewing of\r\ntombs and the making of elaborate funeral furniture,\r\nthat we owe the greater part of our knowledge of their\r\nreligious beliefs . As time went on the embalming of\r\nthe dead was performed in a more elaborate manner,\r\nand at the same time the last resting place of the\r\nmummified body was chosen more carefully and\r\nwrought with greater attention . At a very early period\r\nthe wealthy discarded the use of holes in rocks and\r\ncaves as tombs, for in these the bodies were accessible to the attacks of enemies, and wild animals, and\r\nserpents ; and the same objection was, naturally, made\r\nto shallow hollows made in the limestone and covered\r\nover with slabs of the same material, and also to the\r\nvaulted, crude brick graves which were commonly in\r\nuse in the early dynasties . The place of these was\r\ntaken by pyramids built of stone, and by many-chambered tombs hewn in the living rock . Experience,\r\nhowever, soon shewed the Egyptian that the most\r\ncarefully constructed tomb was incapable of prevent-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XXXIX\r\ning damp-rot or dry-rot and decay, and that some\r\nother power besides his own must be invoked to prevent the destruction of the body, which, though needing longer time to accomplish, was as effectually performed by these means as by the tooth of the wild\r\nanimal or serpent, or by the hand of the enemy . At this\r\nstage the aid of the professional religious man or priest\r\nwas called in, and the task of finding means to prevent rot and decay was entrusted to him . There is J\r\nlittle doubt that when the body was laid to rest in\r\nthe tomb, the priest pronounced certain words or formulae or prayers over it, and it is probable that the\r\nrecital of these words was accompanied by the performance of certain ceremonies . Whatever these formulae were they formed the foundation of the Book\r\nof the Dead of later Egyptian times . It is idle to\r\nattempt to consider what such words were, but we\r\nare within our right if we assume that they were\r\naddressed to the god or gods of the community on\r\nbehalf of the dead, and that they contained petitions\r\nfor the welfare of the departed in the world beyond\r\nthe grave. Such petitions would refer more to material than to spiritual happiness . Indeed it is more\r\nthan doubtful if the Egyptian, at that time, had developed any spiritual conceptions, in our sense of the\r\nword ; for, although his ideas were very definite as to\r\nthe reality of a future existence, I think that he had\r\nformulated few details about it, and that he had no\r\nidea as to where or how it was to be enjoyed .\r\nXL INTRODUCTION.\r\nCertain portions of texts which have been incorporated into religious works of a later period shew\r\nthat the life which the Egyptian hoped to live after\r\ndeath was one similar to that which he led upon\r\nearth, and it is clear that he thought the preservation\r\nof his natural or material body to be, in some way,\r\nabsolutely necessary for the attainment of this life .\r\nHe hoped to have power to exercise all the natural\r\nfunctions of his body, and to be able to journey about\r\nat pleasure ; unless the body and all its members\r\nwere preserved, such a life was impossible for him .\r\nThe earliest monuments in Egypt of the historic period\r\nare tombs, and the universal testimony of these is to\r\nthe effect that the Egyptian endeavoured to attain to\r\nthis life by the embalmment of the body, and by the\r\npower which the texts inscribed upon his tomb, coffin,\r\netc ., could give him . And this was always so, for the\r\nearliest tombs prove that they were hewn out or built\r\naccording to a recognized system which had become\r\nsanctified by antiquity, and that they were intended\r\nto keep intact bodies which had been treated with\r\nbalms and balsams, unguents and drugs, and other\r\nsimilar preservative compounds ; and the texts written\r\nupon them take the fact of the existence of a future\r\nlife for granted, and assume that its duration will be\r\ninfinite . The oldest tombs of this kind to which we\r\ncan assign a date belong to the period of the second\r\ndynasty, about B . C. 4200, but there are some in\r\nexistence which are remarkable for the extremely ar-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nXLI\r\nchaic grouping of the inscriptions upon the walls and\r\nwhich may well belong to a very much earlier time . In\r\nthis connexion the evidence supplied by the curious\r\ntombs which MM. Ame'lineau and J . de Morgan have recently excavated at El -'Amrah, a place situated about\r\nfive miles from Abydos on the west bank of the Nile,\r\nis of peculiar interest . Here were found a number of\r\noval graves, sunk in the stony soil to a depth varying from five to six feet, wherein were the skeletons\r\nof human bodies lying upon their sides ; their hands\r\nwere crossed before their faces, and their knees were\r\nbent and were on a level with their chests . With them\r\nwere buried flints, small bronze implements, pottery\r\nornamented and plain, stone vases, shell ornaments,\r\netc ., and, though experts are divided in their opinion\r\nas the exact antiquity of these objects, there seems\r\nlittle doubt that the oldest of them belong to the\r\nperiod of the dawn of Egyptian civilization, and that\r\nis sufficient for our purpose at present . A number of\r\nthe skeletons from the tombs of El ' Amrah were submitted for examination to Dr . Fouquet of Cairo, who\r\nhas found reason for declaring that they shew traces of\r\nthe bodies to which they belonged having been treated with compounds or substances used in embalming\r\nthe dead . This fact sheers that the friends and relatives of the departed who caused their bodies to be\r\nso treated must have considered that it would be of\r\nsome benefit to them in their life in the world beyond\r\nthe grave, and in so doing they were, probably, only\r\nX LI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nconforming to a custom which was already old and\r\nwell established in their day . It must not he forgotten\r\nthat the skeletons in the cemetery of El-`Amrah were\r\nfound lying on their sides, and this fact strongly supports the view that the tombs are not tombs of Egyptians but of their immediate predecessors or of contemporaries of the early dynasties . In no Egyptian tomb\r\nhitherto opened has the mummy been deposited on\r\nits side ; moreover, the Egyptian mummy is always\r\nfound lying upon its back, its arms are always laid\r\non the body, and the hands rest on the tops of the\r\nthighs . Though the burials at El-Amrah tell us nothing\r\nabout the ceremonies, religious or otherwise, which\r\nwere performed over the departed when they were\r\ncommitted to the earth, they prove almost beyond a\r\ndoubt that peoples other than the Egyptians partially\r\nembalmed their dead at that remote period, and this\r\nbeing so it is probable that the religious ideas and\r\nthe belief in a future life which the Egyptians possessed were shared by the nations round about them,\r\nwith whom they were perhaps connected by ties of\r\nblood.\r\nPassing from prehistoric times of which we know\r\nlittle, and that little imperfectly, we come to the tombs\r\nof the first four dynasties, which chew that a great\r\ndevelopment in the religious ideas and funeral ceremonies has taken place since the first of the graves\r\nat El-`Amrah was dug . We see that certain symbolic\r\nceremonies were regularly performed, that a number\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLIII\r\nof priestly officials, with clearly defined duties in connexion with funerals, had come into being, that a\r\nlarge number of festivals were celebrated at or near\r\nthe tomb throughout the year, that the offering of\r\nmeat and drink, of unguents and garments, and of\r\ngreen herbs and flowers at stated times had grown\r\ninto a system, that a number of gods were duly\r\nhonoured and worshipped, that the priests of the\r\ngods belonged to and probably formed the ruling\r\nclass of the districts in which they lived, that certain\r\ngods had already obtained the position of national\r\ndeities who were known and honoured throughout\r\nthe country, and that certain cities, such as Abydos,\r\nAnnu (On), and Memphis, had become centres of teaching of the views and dogmas which their respective\r\npriests had adopted and modified, or had themselves\r\nevolved. It is quite certain that certain priestly officials lived and died, for the texts on their tombs\r\nbear witness to this fact ; if the official lived, then\r\nthe office to which he was appointed existed ; and\r\nif religious books, the reading of which during the\r\nfuneral was necessary for the welfare of the departed,\r\nhad not existed, men would not have been appointed\r\nto read them . At this time we find that certain priests\r\ncalled \"priests of the ka\" were duly appointed, and\r\nthat they performed their ministrations in \"chapels\r\nof the ka\" which were attached to the tombs of kings\r\nand wealthy men ; this chews beyond a doubt that\r\nthe doctrine of the existence of a \"double\" of a man\r\nLIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nlad been evolved, and the making of offerings to it\r\nat stated intervals at the tomb proves that it was\r\nbelieved to dwell therein, and that material meat and\r\ndrink were necessary for its well-being. This is important also as indicating that the offerings were not\r\nconsumed by the deceased himself, however needful\r\nthe ceremony of offering them might be for his general welfare . Similarly, the sufferings, death, and resurrection of Osiris were well known in the period\r\nof the early dynasties, and it is probable that he\r\nbecame the type of the resurrection of man in Egypt,\r\nlong before the religious texts which assume it and\r\nwhich call him the god and king and judge of the\r\ndead passed from oral tradition to inscribed papyrus .\r\nA study of the religious texts of all periods proves\r\nthat the great fundamental religious ideas of the Egyptians remained unchanged from the earliest to the latest historical times, and it seems that they must have\r\nbeen received by the early Egyptian priests in much\r\nthe same form as that in which they handed them\r\non . The doctrine of immortality and everlasting life\r\nand the belief in the resurrection of a spiritual body\r\nare the brightest and most prominent features of the\r\nEgyptian religion ; they survived all the theological\r\ntheories and speculations of the various schools of\r\nreligious thought in Egypt, and to them generations\r\nof men clung with a firmness and tenacity marvellous\r\nto consider. And side by side with these beliefs there\r\nflourished the religious texts to which the name BOOK\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLV\r\nOF THE DEAD has been given, and they appealed mightily to all, from highest to lowest, for they were believed to give man power in the world beyond the\r\ngrave, and to enable him to attain to the abode of\r\nthe blessed and to gain everlasting life .\r\nNo amount of research and no discovery have, as\r\nyet, yielded any information about the home, and\r\norigin, and early history of the Book of the Dead .\r\nIt seems pretty clear that, as said above, the first\r\nform of all of the Book of the Dead consisted of the\r\nwords or petitions addressed to the \"god of the city\",\r\nor to a collection of supernatural powers, on behalf\r\nof the deceased by relatives and friends, and that\r\nsuch petitions referred to material rather than to spiritual things . That they would increase in number and\r\nin length as time went on is only what is to be expected, and the nature of their contents also would\r\nvary according to the rank and position of the deceased . At first they were recited only and not written\r\ndown, and it is probable that they existed in this form\r\nfor a very long period ; at length they were done into writing, but this, I believe, only took place when\r\nthe professional religious men or priests began to be\r\ndoubtful about the meaning of some of them, and uncertain about the way in which they should be written . The priests wrote them down to preserve them,\r\nand thus endeavoured to keep without further corruption texts which already in their day had become\r\nexceedingly old and difficult of understanding . The\r\nX LV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nwriting materials which they employed for this purpose are unknown . It is hardly possible that they inscribed their texts upon stone, for had they done so\r\nremains of such inscriptions would certainly have been\r\nfound ere this . In Egypt, at all events, the commonest\r\nwriting material was the papyrus, and, the hieroglyphic for \"book\" or \"writing\" being in the earliest\r\ntimes a roll of papyrus tied round the middle with a\r\nstring of the same material, it is probable that religious texts were first written upon papyrus rolls . The\r\nsyllabary, or alphabet, or both, employed by these\r\nearly scribes would probably be hieroglyphic or pictorial, but no specimen of it has come down to us ;\r\nit is not likely that the signs used for writing the texts\r\nwould be wholly alphabetic or wholly syllabic, for in\r\nthe earliest inscriptions known to us both kinds are\r\nused. Where and by whom the texts of the Book of\r\nthe Dead were composed is also unknown . There is\r\nno good reason for assuming that they are the offspring of the minds of Libyans or dwellers of Central\r\nAfrica, they cannot be the literary product of savages\r\nor negroes, there is no evidence to shew that they\r\nare of Semitic origin, and the general testimony of\r\ntheir contents indicates an Asiatic home for their birthplace . Certain of the ideas expressed in the earliest\r\nform of the Book of the Dead known to us are gross\r\nand brutal, but they were retained rather by the conservative spirit of the Egyptians than by any belief\r\nin them ; their reverence for ancient writings and\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLVII\r\ncustoms is too well known to need comment here .\r\nThat such texts should suffer modification as time\r\nwent on is only to be expected, but we may be sure\r\nthat the original purpose of them remained unchanged,\r\nand that all really essential ideas and beliefs of a\r\nfundamental character found expression always in the\r\nsame way. Wherever its original home may have been,\r\nor whatever was its origin, or whoever were its authors, it is quite certain that the Book of the Dead,\r\nin a connected form, is as old as Egyptian civilization,\r\nand that its sources belong to prehistoric times to\r\nwhich it is impossible to assign a date .\r\nWe first touch solid ground in the history of the\r\nBook of the Dead in the period of the early dynasties,\r\nand, if we accept one tradition which was current in\r\nEgypt as early as B . C. 2500, we are right in believing that certain parts of it are, in their present form,\r\nas old as the time of the first dynasty . The LXIVth\r\nChapter, which is admitted on all hands to be exceedingly old, exists in two versions . The rubric to\r\none of these declares that the Chapter is as old as\r\nthe time of Hesepti, the fifth king of the first dynasty,\r\nabout B . C . 4266, and says that it was \"found\" beneath\r\nthe Hennu boat by the foreman of the builders ; and\r\nthe rubric to the other (see pp . i 18, 1 19) states that\r\nit was \"found\" at Hermopolis, inscribed upon a block\r\nof ironstone, by Herutataf (the son of Khufu or Cheops,\r\nthe second king of the IVth dynasty, about B. C .\r\n3733), when he was inspecting the temples throughout\r\nX LV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe country . These opinions find expression upon\r\ncoffins of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties and in\r\npapyri of the best period, that is to say, from about\r\nB . C. i 6oo to B . C. i o00 ; and though one makes out\r\nthe Chapter to be some six hundred years older than\r\nthe other, both agree in assigning to it a date which\r\nis coaeval with the Early Empire . It is difficult to\r\nknow what is exactly meant by the word \"found\" .\r\nIt may, of course, mean that a stone slab bearing the\r\ntext of the Chapter was discovered whilst certain repairs or alterations were being carried out in the\r\ntemple of the god Thoth at Hermopolis, or it may\r\nmean that the Chapter was edited in some way by\r\nKhufu's son Herutataf. The latter explanation is certainly the more probable, for we know from other\r\nsources that Herutataf was a learned man, and that\r\nhe was the author of various literary works, which\r\nenjoyed a considerable reputation . On the other hand,\r\nthe ancient custom of ascribing the works of unknown\r\nauthors to famous men may have already been in\r\nvogue .\r\nOf the Book of the Dead of the second, third, and\r\nfourth dynasties we know nothing, and no copies of\r\nany part of the Recension then in use have come\r\ndown to us ; the texts on the tombs of the priests of\r\nthat period spew that funeral ceremonies were performed in accordance with the instructions contained\r\nin the rubrics to the various Chapters of the Book\r\nof the Dead, and the existence of collections of reli-\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . XLIX\r\ngious texts stands assured . During the reign of Menkau-Ra, the Mycerinus of the Greeks, the fourth king\r\nof the fourth dynasty, about B . C . 3633, certain Chapters, i . e ., XXXB and CXLVIII, are said to have been\r\nfound by Herutat tf, and there are traditions extant\r\nthat religious ceremonies were performed with renewed vigour during the reign of this king. On the\r\ncoffin of Men-kau-Ra (Brit . Mus. No . 664.7) are inscribed two lines' of text which are also found on the walls\r\ninside the pyramids of Teta and Pepi I, kings of the\r\nsixth dynasty ; it would be absurd to suppose that\r\nthese lines formed the only portion of the text known\r\nin the fourth dynasty, and thus we are entitled to\r\nassume that the same Recension of the Book of the\r\nDead which was known and copied in the sixth dynasty was also known and copied in the fourth dynasty. From the lines on the coffin of Men-kau-Ra\r\nwe learn some interesting facts : namely, that the dead\r\nking was identified with the god, that the divine origin of the god was ascribed also to the king, that\r\nthe life of the king in the world beyond . the grave\r\nwas to be that of a god, that all his foes were to\r\nbe vanquished, and that he was to become a being\r\npossessed of life everlasting . Here, then, is a proof\r\nof the acceptance of the Osiris story and of the doci . They read : \"[Hail,] Osiris, king of the North and South, Men-kau-\r\n\"Ra, living for ever! born of heaven, conceived of Nut, heir of Seb his\r\n\"beloved. Thy mother Nut spreadeth herself over thee in her name of\r\n\" `mystery of heaven' ; she granteth that thou mayest exist as a god with-\r\n\"out thy foes, O king of the North and South, Men-kau-Rd, living forever .\"\r\nd\r\nL\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ntrine of immortality, or everlasting life, at a very remote period in Egypt .\r\nDuring the period of the fifth and sixth dynasties\r\na remarkable development took place in the funeral\r\nceremonies performed for Egyptian kings . The kings\r\nof the fourth dynasty Khufu (Cheops), Kha - f - Ra\r\n(Khephren), and Men-kau-Ra had built for their tombs\r\nthe stone pyramids at Gizeh, which to this day excite\r\nthe wonder and admiration of the civilized world, but\r\nthe walls of the chambers and corridors are uninscribed, and they tell us nothing of the texts which\r\nwere recited during the funeral, and nothing of the\r\nceremonies by which they were accompanied . At the\r\nclose of the fifth dynasty, however, Unas the king\r\n(B. C . 3333) built as his tomb a stone pyramid at a\r\nplace now called Sakkara, which is situated on the\r\nwest bank of the Nile, a few miles to the south of\r\nthe modern city of Cairo, and he covered the greater\r\nparts of the walls of the chambers, corridors, etc.,\r\nwith several hundred vertical lines of hieroglyphic\r\ntext which were deeply cut and filled up with green\r\npaint or composition . In the year 1881 M . Maspero\r\neffected an entrance into this pyramid, and he recognized at once the fact that the inscriptions which he\r\nsaw before him formed the text of the Book of the\r\nDead which was in use in Egypt during the period of\r\nthe fifth dynasty . Continuing his labours in this \"pyramid field\" he opened the pyramids of Teta, Pepi I,\r\nMer-en-Ra, and Pepi II, kings of the sixth dynasty who\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLI\r\nreigned from about B . C . 33oo to B . C . 3i66, and he\r\nfound that the texts which covered the walls inside\r\nwere duplicates, with additions, of those which he\r\nhad already found in the pyramid of Unas .' We thus\r\nsee, for the first time, a collected series of texts of\r\nthe Book of the Dead in the earliest Recension known\r\nto us ; this Recension may for convenience be called\r\nthe `Heliopolitan', because it bears unmistakable evidence that it was drawn up by the priests of Annu\r\n(On or Heliopolis), and that it contains the peculiar\r\nviews held by the priests of the colleges of that very\r\nancient city . Though five sets of extracts from it have\r\ncome down to us in a tolerably complete state of\r\npreservation, we must not assume that they represent\r\nall the texts which belonged to it, indeed the various\r\nsections of it which were copied upon funeral monuments and papyri in later times indicate that for all\r\npractical purposes its extent was illimitable . How much\r\n\"editing\" was done to the texts of this Recension by\r\nthe priests of Annu cannot be said, but there is considerable evidence scattered throughout it which shews\r\nthat they had been edited two or three times before,\r\nand it is clear that we have preserved in it many\r\nreligious ideas and beliefs which belong to what may\r\nbe termed strata of religious thought of different\r\ni . These texts, together with French translations, have been published\r\nby M . Maspero under the title of Les Inscriptions des Pyramides de Saqgarah, Paris, 1894 ; the various sections of this work had before appeared\r\nin Recueil de Travaux, tom.

Some of them certainly go back\r\nto a period in the history of the Egyptians when they\r\ncelebrated their triumphs over their enemies in a brutal\r\nand savage fashion, and others belong to a time when\r\ntheir ancestors stood but little higher on the ladder\r\nof civilization than the barbarous tribes who lived on\r\ntheir western and southern frontiers .\r\nThe Heliopolitan Recension of the Book of the Dead\r\nconsists of a series of paragraphs, each of which is\r\nintroduced by the word \"recite\" ;scattered throughout the text are directions to the priests who performed the ceremonies when to make certain presentations of meat, drink, and other objects . In later\r\ndays the rubrical directions were written at the\r\nends of the sections, and titles were given to the\r\nsections, which henceforth became special Chapters,\r\nintended to produce certain definite results . An excellent idea of the arrangement of the texts in the\r\npyramids will be obtained from the accompanying page\r\nof hieroglyphic extract which is taken from the text\r\nwritten for Unas, 1 . 496 ff.\r\nAt the end of the sixth dynasty the walls of the\r\nchambers of tombs built for great and wealthy men\r\nwere profusely ornamented with texts and scenes,\r\nboth coloured and uncoloured ; but in none do we\r\nfind religious texts belonging to the collection which\r\nthe royal pyramids have revealed to us .

Of the\r\nhistory, too, of the period of the seventh, eighth, ninth,\r\nand tenth dynasties very little is known, and though\r\nin certain districts in Upper Egypt tombs of considerable size and beauty were built, yet no striking development in the funeral texts seems to have taken\r\nplace, or, if it did, we have no record of it .

HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLV\r\nwe have a number of coffins of considerable importance for the study of the Book of the Dead. They\r\nmay be roughly divided into three classes : (i) those\r\nwhich are painted to represent funeral chambers or\r\ntombs, (2) those which are almost plain outside but\r\ncovered inside with texts in the hieratic or cursive\r\nEgyptian character, and (3) those which are inscribed\r\nboth inside and out . The texts are usually traced in\r\nblack upon the planed surface of the wood, the chief inscriptions which record the name and titles of the deceased being painted in large hieroglyphics either in\r\na vertical line down the length of the cover, or in a\r\nhorizontal line round the upper part of the four sides\r\nof the coffin . On the right hand side, at the foot, is\r\noften painted or inlaid the double utch'n 0M, or\r\nso-called \"symbolic eyes\" . Plates I and II illustrate\r\nas far as possible without the use of colours the arrangement of the text on such coffins . The scene in\r\nPlate I is from one end (inside) of the famous coffin\r\nof Amamu (Brit. plus . No. 6,654) . The border with its\r\npattern of rectangles is painted in bright colours, red,\r\ngreen, and yellow, and all round the upper part of\r\nthe sides are painted the principal objects which formed\r\nthe usual offerings to the dead, and a prayer that the\r\ndeceased may have such things offered in his tomb\r\nfor ever. Here we see vases and jars of various\r\nshapes and sizes filled with unguents and cosmetics,\r\nthe names of which are given in the line of hieroglyphics above them ; they are set upon a stand,\r\nLVI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nbroken examples of which have been from time to\r\ntime found in tombs . Each of the vertical lines of\r\ntext begins with the word U\r\nr\r\n\"recite\", a fact which\r\nshews that the text was usually inscribed upon the\r\nwalls of tombs . Plate II gives an extract from the\r\ntext inscribed upon the coffin of Sebek-aa preserved\r\nat Berlin. It will be noticed that the hieroglyphics\r\nhave begun to assume a conventional form, and that\r\nthey do not so readily suggest the objects which they\r\nrepresent . We notice, too, that the various sections\r\non such coffins have specific titles attached to them,\r\nin other words they have become \"Chapters\" . As the\r\npyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasties do not all\r\ncontain the same selection of extracts from the Book\r\nof the Dead, so the coffins of the eleventh and twelfth\r\ndynasties do not all contain the same selection of\r\nChapters ; this fact shews that the selection of the\r\nextracts and Chapters did not follow any general rule,\r\nbut whether it depended upon the will and discretion\r\nof the scribe or the deceased cannot be said . Down\r\nthe length of the bottom of the coffin inside was frequently painted a band of white across which were\r\ntraced in blue wavy lines to indicate water ; this probably represented the celestial Nile, or the stream\r\nupon which the deceased hoped to float to the Elysian Fields . We must note, in passing, that at the\r\nperiod when these coffins were made no pyramids\r\nwere inscribed with extracts or Chapters from the\r\nBook of the Dead ; in other words, it was found both\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE Xlth and XIIth\r\nDYNASTY.\r\nPLATE II .\r\nFrom the Sarcophagus of Sebek-Aa.

LVII\r\ncheaper and easier to write the text with ink or colours upon planks which could be afterwards pegged\r\ntogether to form coffins . This custom resulted in the\r\ncurtailment of the selection of texts, and in less than\r\na thousand years after the religious texts in the pyramids of the fifth and sixth dynasties were cut, we\r\nfind that certain portions of them had fallen into disuse.\r\nWe have already seen that a period lies between\r\nthe sixth and eleventh dynasties (luring which we\r\nknow nothing of the Book of the Dead, and again\r\nduring the period which lies between the twelfth and\r\neighteenth dynasties we know nothing of it . With the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth dynasty the Book of the\r\nDead begins a new phase of its existence, and a development of its history as interesting as it is unexpected is before us . From pyramids the transition\r\nwas to coffins, and now the transition is from coffins\r\nto papyri. And here again economy probably played\r\nan important part. Inscribed pyramids, and sarcophagi,\r\nand coffins would, necessarily, be only made for royal\r\npersonages and for great and wealthy folk, lout a roll\r\nof papyrus was, in comparison with these, a very inexpensive thing, especially if the services of an ordinary scribe were employed in inscribing it .\r\nThe greater number of the copies of the Book of\r\nthe Dead inscribed upon papyri have been found at\r\nThebes, indeed those made in this city are of such\r\nimportance, that to the Recension of the work which\r\nLV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nwe commonly find in use in Egypt from the eighteenth\r\nto the twenty-second dynasty the name \"Theban\" has\r\nbeen given . We owe them chiefly to the scribes and\r\npriests who were attached to the powerful confraternity of the priests of \"Amen-Ra, the king of the gods\",\r\nand, speaking generally, the best 1-ISS . are found in\r\ntheir tombs and coffins . The original home of the texts\r\nwhich they copied, was, of course, Memphis or Heliopolis, and there is reason for believing that during\r\nthe earlier centuries of their existence they did little\r\nmore than adopt the religious views and doctrines of\r\nthe sages of the North . As time went on, and the\r\nworshippers of Amen obtained greater power, this god\r\nwas slowly but surely made to usurp the attributes\r\nof the older cosmic gods of Egypt, and eventually,\r\nas we see in Chapter CLXXI (infra, p. 315), his name\r\nis included among those of the old gods of the Book\r\nof the Dead.\r\nThe papyri inscribed with copies of the Theban\r\nRecension of the Book of the Dead vary in length\r\nfrom about 15 to go feet, and in width from 12 to\r\n18 inches ; in many cases the various pieces which\r\nform the papyrus are so carefully put together that\r\nit is almost impossible to see where one piece ends\r\nand the other begins . In the early part of the eighteenth dynasty the text is always written with black\r\nink in vertical columns of hieroglyphics, which are\r\nseparated from each other by black lines ; the titles\r\nof the Chapters, and the initial word or words of\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XVIIIth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Nebseni, Brit .

In the eighteenth\r\ndynasty, or perhaps a little earlier, the scribes began to ornament the papyri with designs in black\r\noutline, referring to the subject matter of the text\r\nnear which they were placed ; such designs, or \"vignettes\", as they are usually called, occupy quite a\r\nsubordinate position, and they were drawn most probably by the scribe . Little by little, however, they\r\nincreased in number, and it became the fashion to\r\nilluminate them with bright colours, greens, reds, yellows. In the nineteenth dynasty the unilluminated\r\npapyrus became the exception, and the Vignettes\r\nflourished at the expense of the text . An idea of the\r\nbeauty of a fully coloured papyrus of the best period\r\nmay be gained from the frontispiece to this volume\r\nand from the plates which face pp . i 9 and 170, and\r\nPlates III -VIII will illustrate the characteristics of good\r\nMSS. of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, except as to colour. Plate III illustrates the writing\r\nand Vignettes of the famous Papyrus of Nebseni (Brit.\r\nMus. No. 9,900) which was found at Memphis ; it measures 77 feet 7'\/, in ., by i ft. i '\/, in ., and contains\r\nseventy-seven Chapters, not including duplicates and\r\ntriplicates . The Vignettes are traced in outline and\r\nare remarkably well drawn ; and both Vignettes and\r\ntext appear to be the work of one scribe, probably\r\nNebseni himself. The Papyrus of Nebseni was apparently written early in the eighteenth dynasty . Plate IV\r\nLX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncontains a Vignette and a piece of text from the Papyrus of Nu (Brit. Mus. No . 10,477), which was found\r\nat Thebes ; it measures 65 ft. 3 ' \/ 2 in., by i ft . 1 '\/2 in .,\r\nand contains one hundred and thirty-one Chapters .\r\nThough shorter than the Papyrus of Nebseni, the texts\r\ninscribed on it are more numerous, for the writing is\r\nsmaller and the lines are closer together . Some of\r\nthe Chapters have Vignettes, but they occupy an entirely subordinate position, and the colouring is not\r\nas fine as that found in documents of a later date .\r\nThe date of this papyrus cannot be much later than\r\nthat of Nebseni. On Plate V we have an example of\r\nthe very fine, bold writing which is found in the Papyrus of Ani (Brit. Mus . No . 10,470), which was found\r\nat Thebes ; this document measures 78 feet by i ft .\r\n3 in ., and contains sixty-six Chapters . It is the finest\r\nof all the illuminated papyri of the eighteenth dynasty, and from an artistic point of view its value is\r\ngreater than that of any other papyrus . It is made\r\nup of six distinct lengths of papyrus which have been\r\nneatly joined ; the text was written by several scribes,\r\nand the Vignettes are the work of more than one artist . An examination of the document shews that the\r\nartist's work was done before the text was written ;\r\nat times the space needed for the text was miscalculated, and the scribe was compelled to reduce the\r\nsize of his writing, and even to write words on the\r\ncoloured border within which text and Vignettes are\r\nenclosed. The first sixteen feet of the papyrus were\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XVIIIth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Ani, Brit. Mus .

The Hymn to Osiris on Plate VI is\r\nprobably in Ani's own handwriting, and the characters are formed with an attention to detail not often\r\nfound elsewhere . The Vignettes and text on plate VII\r\nshew the work of two scribes and two artists, and\r\nalso shew that the inscribed portion of one section\r\nwas done on a larger scale than was contemplated\r\nin the earlier sections ; here we see that the borders\r\nhad to be enlarged to make the join . From this we\r\nsee, too, that the planning of a papyrus was a matter which was left to the discretion of the artist and\r\nscribe ; and when we consider that the Papyrus of\r\nNebseni contains duplicates and even triplicates of\r\nsome Chapters, and that the Papyrus of Ani contains\r\ntwo copies of Chapter XVIII (one with an introduction and one without), slightly differing from each\r\nother and having the sections of the Vignette arranged\r\ndifferently, it is clear that even the best scribes did\r\nnot tie themselves to any one plan or method in preparing a copy of the Book of the Dead . We may\r\nnote too that in the Papyrus of Ani a large section\r\nof the text of Chapter XVII has been omitted by the\r\nscribe, probably because the artist had not left sufficient space for the whole Chapter . In the text, moreover, several palpable errors occur, but, on the other\r\nhand, we have in the Vignettes descriptions of mythological scenes, names of gods, etc ., which occur in\r\nLXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nno other text ; \u2022a mong these worthy of special mention are the judgment Scene and the accompanying\r\ntexts, and the Vignette to the XVII th Chapter .\r\nPlate VIII gives us a Vignette and a few lines of\r\ntext from the Papyrus of Hu-nefer, a scribe and superintendent of cattle who flourished in the reign of\r\nSeti I, about B . C . 13 70 ; the cartouche of the king\r\naffords conclusive proof as to its date . This document\r\nis remarkable from many points of view . It is the\r\nshortest perfect MS . of its class known, measuring\r\ni8 feet by i ft. 3 3\/8 in. The Vignettes are beautiful\r\nspecimens of the artist's work, and the scene in which\r\nthe performance of the ceremony of \"Opening the\r\nMouth\" is depicted is the most perfect known ; but\r\nthe Vignette to Chapter XVII is imperfect when compared with that of the Papyrus of Ani . The copy of\r\nChapter I is so good that M . Naville employed it as\r\nthe standard text in his Todtenbuch, but the copy of\r\nChapter XVII is so incomplete and incorrect that he\r\nfound it useless even for purposes of comparison .\r\nHere again we see that the Vignettes were executed\r\nat the expense of the text ; in spite of this, however,\r\nthe papyrus is valuable, for it contains a Hymn to\r\nOsiris by the god Thoth which is not found elsewhere\r\nin the same form. The text is written in a good,\r\nbold hand, but with little attention to the details of\r\nthe characters ; and the judgment Scene exhibits many\r\npeculiarities, both in respect of text and arrangement.\r\nPlates IX and X illustrate the Vignettes and the\r\nI\r\nCD\r\na\r\nz\r\n0\r\ns\r\nx\r\nw\r\nr\r\nz\r\nO\r\nQ\r\nw\r\n0\r\nl\r\nLip 1 7rAlIt ~~pb ~4 '~f dpi\r\n\r\n_ 0~3 ~oPd\u00AEpubo~: p\r\nFIN\r\n\\ 1 \\\\\r\n\r\ny\r\n,~F\r\nI\r\nV'Q :~I :QICI c ij;~\r\n~o~~ :O1w14) 3~_1$I~I o c==\" i s\r\n\r\nD o \u00A90~\r\n1~wC=n1(II~\r\nIvil Wig\r\n~(: F\r\n_\r\nCIO\r\nf~,~7i\r\n~d' ~~OLOi\r\nG~}dl~~ II\r\n'\r\nL( d~~I:~ l(~fl ~M\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XIXth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Hu-nefer, Brit .

In Plate IX we\r\nsee the \"royal mother Netchemet\" standing behind\r\nher son Her-Heru ; the dress and ornaments of these\r\nroyal personages shew the change which has taken\r\nplace in such matters since the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, and in the manner of depicting them .\r\nThe colours of the Vignettes are more crude, the\r\ndelicacy of design and of execution alike has departed, and a comparison of the text with that of the\r\nPapyrus of Nu shews that the skill of the scribe had\r\ndeteriorated . The hieratic text on Plate X gives an\r\nexcellent idea of the writing of the period . In the\r\ntwentieth dynasty Books of the Dead inscribed for\r\nthe priests of Amen began with a Vignette, either\r\nplain or coloured, in which the deceased was seen\r\nmaking offerings to Osiris or to the gods of Thebes .\r\nThis was followed by a selection of Chapters from\r\nthe Book of the Dead in use in the eighteenth dynasty,\r\nor by a series of texts peculiar to the period accompanied by Vignettes taken from other funeral works .\r\nSometimes, as in the case of the Princess Nesi-Khonsu,\r\nthe document begins with a long, detailed list of the\r\ntitles of Amen-Ra, who by this time had usurped the\r\nattributes of the old gods of Egypt, which is followed\r\nby a series of statements in which the god, in apparently legal language, swears to confer every favour\r\npossible upon the deceased lady . Such documents are\r\nnot very long, and they are usually much narrower\r\nLXIV\r\n\r\nINTROD UCTION.\r\nthan Books of the Dead of the earlier period . The\r\nmythological figures and scenes characteristic of the\r\nlater documents of the priests of Amen are not yet\r\nwell understood, for only a few have been published\r\nin entirety.\r\nOf papyri of the twenty-first dynasty which preserve many characteristics of the earlier period may\r\nbe mentioned that of Anhai, a priestess of Amen\r\n(Brit . Mus. No. 10,472), a section of which is shewn\r\non Plate XI. Here we have, however, a work sui\r\ngenerzs which is very instructive from many points\r\nof view. The artist's work is the most valuable part\r\nof the papyrus, and the use of gold for purposes of\r\nillumination appears for the first time . In addition to\r\nthe Vignettes of the older period we find here the\r\nscene of the Creation given much as it is found on\r\nthe Sarcophagus of Seti I, and a rare Vignette which\r\nseems to refer to Khemennu, the city of Thoth . The\r\ntexts are fragmentary and often. have no connexion\r\nwith the Vignettes which accompany them, but many\r\nof the Vignettes are of considerable interest . The\r\nhandwriting is, in some places, very good, but it\r\nlacks the bold firmness which is characteristic of the\r\nolder scribes . In papyri of the eighteenth dynasty we\r\nfind many mistakes, but most of them may be attributed to momentary carelessness on the part of a\r\nweary scribe ; whereas in those of the twenty-first and\r\nsucceeding dynasties the writers of the texts seem\r\nto be altogether reckless . Texts are copied beginning\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXth DYNASTY.\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Queen Netchemet, in the possession of H .R .H .\r\nthe Prince of Wales.\r\nPLATE IX.\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXth DYNASTY .\r\n4 Rj\r\n\r\n~ ~ a .ii ~?r~rc\r\nCn\t+I,- D--. .a t-f__Liuann NAtnhamAt Rnit Miic_ Nn_ 1(L4ACL shppt 4.\r\nPLATE X .\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nLXV\r\nat the end instead of at the beginning, omissions of\r\nwhole sections are frequent, texts that have proper\r\nVignettes are copied without the least regard to the\r\ncorrect Vignettes, and what is intended to be a Chapter frequently consists of nothing but a series of fragments of sentences copied without break merely to\r\nfill up the space which the artist had spared for the\r\npurpose. It seems as if the artist both painted the\r\nVignettes and wrote the text, and as if his sole aim\r\nwas to produce a handsome, but not accurate, document. The contents of the papyri reflect, no doubt,\r\nthe religious views commonly held at that period,\r\nand, if this be so, it is clear that the priests of Amen\r\nheld the texts, which they inserted alongside of the\r\nChapters of the older period, to be of equal value\r\nand authority. Some of them went so far as fill their\r\npapyri with religious compositions which are never\r\nto be found in the old works. In Plate XII we have a\r\nVignette with a few lines of text from the papyrus\r\nBrit. Mus . No. 10,478, which I believe was written in\r\nthe twenty-second dynasty . The artist's work is a copy,\r\nor rather a very poor imitation, of the illuminating\r\nof the nineteenth dynasty, and the text consists of a\r\nseries of compositions referring to the offerings which\r\nwere to be made to the gods of the Qerti, or divisions of the underworld . Strictly speaking, these have\r\nnothing whatever to do with the Book of the Dead,\r\nbut in the opinion of the scribe they were equally\r\nefficacious . In the same dynasty a large number of\r\ne\r\nLXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncopies of selections of Chapters from the Book of the\r\nDead were written in hieratic, with Vignettes traced\r\nin outline in black ink. In some of these the papyrus measures about 40 ft . by i ft . 6 in ., and in others\r\nthe dimensions are considerably less . An idea of the\r\nappearance of such papyri may be gained from Plate\r\nXIII, which illustrates both the fine drawing and small\r\nbut clear hieratic writing of the period . It is probable\r\nthat the Books of the Dead written in hieratic during\r\nthe twentieth, twenty-first, and twenty-second dynasties\r\nbelong to a Recension different in many respects from\r\nthe Theban, but that such Recension is akin to the\r\nTheban there is no doubt whatever . In both the Chapters have no fixed order, and in both the Chapters\r\nhave special titles, a characteristic which distinguishes\r\nthem from the sections of the Books of the Dead of\r\nthe fifth, sixth, eleventh and twelfth dynasties . It is\r\ntolerably easy to identify the papyri which were inscribed before B . C . goo, in fact, as long as the power\r\nof the priests of Amen was paramount at Thebes, the\r\ncopies of the Books of the Dead which were inscribed for them reflect the prosperity of the confraternity. But when it became necessary for the priests\r\nto hide at Der el-bahari the mummies of the kings and\r\nqueens who had been their greatest benefactors,\r\nand troublous times came upon them, everything relating to the rites and ceremonies connected with the\r\ndead suffered, and the relatives and friends of the\r\ndead were obliged to do for them not what they\r\nPLATE XT.

Eventually, it would seem,\r\na time came when no Books of the Dead were written, and this period corresponds, I believe, to the\r\nfinal failure of the domination of the priests of Amen .\r\nThis is not the place to lament the mistake which\r\nthe priests of Amen made when they tried to rule\r\nEgypt temporally as well as spiritually, or to regret the\r\npolicy which made them exalt their god Amen above\r\nthe older gods of the country whom the people had\r\nknown and worshipped from time immemorial ; it is\r\nsufficient to know that in each matter they failed .\r\nThey lost their own temporal power as the result of\r\ntheir intrigues, and at best they only succeeded in\r\nobtaining for their god a place side by side with the\r\nold gods. It must, however, not be forgotten that we\r\nowe some of the best and finest copies of the Book\r\nof the Dead to scribes who had married priestesses\r\nof Amen, and who were themselves attached to the\r\nbrotherhood .\r\nWith the rise of the kings of the twenty-sixth dynasty to power the Book of the Dead enters upon a\r\nnew lease of life, and a general revival of ancient\r\nreligious customs took place ; the temples were repaired, ancient and long forgotten texts were re-copied, and artists and sculptors took their models from\r\nthe best works of the masters of the Early Empire .\r\nEarly in this dynasty, it appears, the priesthood which\r\nsucceeded the priests of Amen awoke to the consciousness of the fact that the texts of the Book of\r\ne*\r\nLXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe Dead needed re-editing and re-arranging, and\r\nthey set to work to try to put some system into them .\r\nHow and when exactly the work was done we know\r\nnot, but it is probable that it was carried out by an\r\nassembly or college of priests . We have seen above\r\nthat scribes tied themselves to no one plan in making\r\ntheir copies of the Book of the Dead and that the\r\nwork of the artist on the Vignettes (which were subordinate matters originally) was at times allowed to\r\ndrive the text from the papyrus ; in the best papyri,\r\ntoo, the selection of texts copied is never the same,\r\nand the order of them is never the same . In fact each\r\npapyrus had a plan of its own . These things the\r\npriests of the twenty-sixth dynasty tried to correct,\r\nand the result of their labours was a Recension of\r\nthe Book of the Dead which is usually called the\r\n\"Saite\" . A number of papyri are extant which are\r\ninscribed therewith, and an examination of them shews\r\nthat the Chapters follow a certain order, and that although the papyri vary in length, the selection of\r\nChapters being not as full in some of them as in others,\r\nthis order has few exceptions. Each of the early Recensions of the Book of the Dead known to us exhibits peculiarities which reflect the religious views of\r\nthe time when it was written, and the Saite Recension is not an exception to the rule, for included in\r\nit are four Chapters (CLXII-CLXV) which have no\r\ncounterparts in the papyri of the older period ; they\r\nare remarkable also for containing a number of for-\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD IN THE XXIInd DYNASTY.\r\nr\r\nL+~ ~\r\n\r\nq#q tt ! .\r\nti9.1 3lott- ;rt V).*aa I ftI . t\r\nR J\r\na\r\nFrom the Papyrus of Heru-em-heb, Brit .

It has been suggested that these Chapters\r\nare of Nubian origin, and if so it would be interesting to know the circumstances under which they were\r\ninserted in the Book of the Dead . It is difficult to\r\nidentify with certainty the papyri which were actually\r\nwritten during the twenty-sixth dynasty, but MSS .\r\nwritten in the period immediately preceding the Ptolemaic are not difficult to recognize . Plate XIV gives\r\nfourteen lines of text and part of a Vignette from a\r\ndocument of this class (Brit . Mus . No . 10,479), and\r\nshews what a well defined class it is . The text is\r\nwritten with black ink in vertical columns of spidery\r\nhieroglyphics separated by black lines, and the Vignettes occupy small spaces above it ; the Vignettes\r\nof the Sunrise or Sunset, the Judgment Scene, and the\r\nElysian Fields occupy the whole length of the papyrus .\r\nSometimes the Vignettes are all mixed together, but,\r\neven when coloured, they lack the artistic appearance\r\nand good work of the illuminated papyri of the\r\neighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties .\r\nThe Recension in use in the Ptolemaic period is\r\nwell illustrated by Plate XV, which is reproduced\r\nfrom Lepsius' edition of the Turin Papyrus ; this papyrus is probably the best and longest MS . of the\r\nclass known. The selection of Chapters is remarkably\r\nfull ; the number of Chapters, however, is not 165\r\nbut 153, for three of them (Chaps . XVI, CXLIII, and\r\nCL) are in reality Vignettes, and nine others (Chaps .\r\nXLVIII, XLIX, LXXIII, CV1I, CXI, CXX, CXXI,\r\nLXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nCXXIX, and CXXXIX) are duplicates of Chapters\r\nfound in other parts of the papyrus . The titles of the\r\nChapters, catch-words, parts of Rubrics, etc ., are\r\nwritten in red .\r\nMeanwhile, however, a number of short religious\r\nworks for funeral use had been composed, presumably\r\nby the priests, and it seems that towards the end of\r\nthe PtolemaIc period it was more usual to inscribe\r\nthese upon papyri than the Chapters of the old Recensions of the Book of the Dead . It seems as if an\r\nattempt was made to extract only the essential portions of the old works and to omit from the shortened\r\nnew texts the Chapters which referred to faiths which\r\nwere dead and to beliefs which had little or no influence\r\nin those modern times . Added to this, the knowledge\r\nof such matters must have disappeared from the community long before the Ptolemies ruled the land, and,\r\nthough the belief in the resurrection of the spiritual\r\nbody and in life everlasting beyond the grave retained its power over the people as firmly as ever,\r\nmost men had no knowledge whatever of the texts\r\nwhich their forefathers who were dead and gone\r\nimagined to be necessary for the attainment of the\r\nsame . The sepulchral stelae and coffins shew that\r\nneither the employer nor the employed had an exact\r\nidea of the import of the texts and symbols which\r\nwere cut or painted upon them, and to ignorance\r\nas much as to haste must be attributed the blunders\r\nwhich occur in funeral texts of this period .

LXXI\r\nthere we find an attempt to preserve Vignettes and\r\ntexts of the old period along with the modern work,\r\nand a good example of this class of document is the\r\nPapyrus of Kerasher (Brit . Mus . No . 9,995), a portion\r\nof which is reproduced on Plate XVI. Here we have\r\na representation of the judgment Scene, crude alike\r\nin colour and detail, a part of the Vignette of the\r\nfirst Chapter of the old Book of the Dead, a number of the Pylons discussed in Chapters CXLV and\r\nCXLVI, etc ., and two horizontal lines of hieroglyphics\r\nwhich contain prayers reflecting those of an earlier\r\nperiod. No MS . could more clearly shew how little\r\nknowledge of the old Book of the Dead remained in\r\nthe hands of the scribes at that time ; artistic skill,\r\nmoreover, had sunk very low, for it will be noticed\r\nthat the censer which the white-skirted priest is carrying before the bier, and which he was supposed to\r\ncarry in his hand, is almost as long as he is high !\r\nThe coloured portion of this papyrus is followed by\r\nthree columns of text in hieratic which form the work\r\nentitled SHAI EN SENSEN, or \"Book of Breathings\" (see\r\nPlate XVII), wherein we find no hymns, and no addresses to the gods, and in fact no words which do\r\nnot directly refer to the future life of the deceased\r\nin the world beyond the grave . Here we have an\r\nepitome of all that the Egyptian hoped to obtain in\r\nthe \"land of eternity\" .\r\nWe have now reached the end of the Graeco-Roman\r\nperiod, but the end of the Book of the Dead is not\r\nLXXII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nyet, for belonging to the Roman period we find a\r\nnumber of small rolls of papyri inscribed in very\r\ncursive hieratic with a series of statements or assertions referring to the happiness of the deceased in the\r\nnext world . Such papyri have no Vignettes, and as for\r\nthe texts, both hymns and Chapters of the old Book\r\nof the Dead in any Recension are as absent from them\r\nas if they had never existed . The aim of the writer\r\nof such documents was not to glorify the gods, but\r\nto secure the goods of the next world by means of\r\nthe smallest amount of writing possible, and at the\r\nleast expense . On Plate XVIII is reproduced a portion\r\nof a papyrus of this class (Brit . Mus . No. i o, i i i ), and\r\na comparison of it with the earlier Plates in this book\r\nwill shew at once the change which had come over\r\nthe Book of the Dead . What form the Book of the\r\nDead took in the early centuries of the Christian era\r\ncannot be said, but it seems not to have died out\r\nutterly, for selections from it are found copied upon\r\nthe outer and inner swathings of mummies and upon\r\ncoffins of the Roman Period ; on a coffin in Paris,\r\nwhich was probably made about the end of the second century of our era, are written a number of\r\ntexts which are as old as the time of the Pyramids at\r\nSakkara, and this fact proves that when such documents\r\nwere needed originals from which to copy them could\r\nalways be found . There is good reason for assuming\r\nthat the art of making mummies was practised until\r\nthe end of the fifth century of our era, and there is\r\nTHE BOOK OF THE DEAD (OR BOOK OF BREATHINGS)\r\nIN THE GR\/ECO-ROMAN PERIOD.\r\nPLATE X V11.\r\nFrom the Fapyrus of Kerasher, Brit .

LXX11I\r\nno doubt that in certain places the belief that the\r\npreservation of the natural body was absolutely necessary for the growth, development, and existence\r\nof the spiritual body, existed in full force until a\r\nmuch later date. It is not possible to assign a date\r\nto the period when the decay of the Book of the\r\nDead began, but it is probably contemporary with\r\nthe advent of the Greeks in Egypt . Up to that period\r\nEgypt may be described as the home of a nation that\r\nwas given up entirely to the care of the dead and\r\nto the consideration of the future life ; a few of its\r\nkings were soldiers in the true sense of the word,\r\nbut it is a striking fact that the temples and tombs\r\nof Egypt are the chief monuments of one of the oldest\r\nand greatest civilizations of the world. A tottering\r\nreligion would be rudely shaken by the invasions of\r\nthe country by Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and\r\nothers, and the permanent occupation of Egypt by\r\nGreeks and Romans would continue the work which\r\nfrequent disturbances throughout the country had begun . The final blow, however, was not inflicted until\r\nthe Egyptians began to renounce their own ancient\r\nreligion and to become converts of the preaching of\r\nSaint Mark and his followers ; when they were once\r\nable to believe that Christ had the power to raise up\r\ntheir bodies in a spiritual form they felt that there\r\nwas no need to have them mummified, and simultaneously the need for the Chapters of the Book of the\r\nDead disappeared .\r\nLXXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nWe are now able to summarize the various forms\r\nof the Book of the Dead as follows :It first existed in oral tradition only, and was next written down\r\nto preserve it ; of these forms nothing whatever is\r\nknown . The first historical Recension was that made\r\nby the priests of Heliopolis, and the oldest copies\r\nof it known are cut in hieroglyphics upon the walls\r\nof the chambers and passages inside the Pyramids\r\nof Sakkara of the fifth and sixth dynasties . The\r\nsecond Recension was written or painted upon sarcophagi and coffins of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties in cursive hieroglyphics . The third Recension was written in hieroglyphics upon papyri from\r\nthe eighteenth to the twentieth dynasty, the various\r\nChapters having no fixed order ; this Recension was\r\nillustrated by a large number of Vignettes. The fourth\r\nRecension was written in hieratic upon papyri during\r\nthe twenty-first and twenty-second dynasties, and included extracts from various funeral books which were\r\nillustrated by Vignettes of an unusual character . The\r\nfifth or Saite Recension was made, probably, in the\r\ntwenty-sixth dynasty ; the Chapters have a fixed order\r\nand were written on papyri both in hieratic and hieroglyphics. The sixth Recension which was in use in\r\nPtolemaic times much resembled the Saite, and may\r\nbe regarded as the last form of the Book of the Dead,\r\nfor the extracts from it written for the benefit of the\r\ndead upon small pieces of Papyri in the GraecoRoman and Roman periods need hardly be considered .\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . LXXV\r\nThus the great religious work of the Egyptians, which\r\nhad lasted for thousands of years and which in early\r\ntimes, cut in fine, bold hieroglyphics, covered the walls\r\nand passages of the tombs of kings, ended its existence\r\nin almost illegible scrawls hastily traced upon scraps\r\nof papyrus only a few inches square .\r\nFrom first to last throughout the Book of the Dead,\r\nwith the single exception of Herutataf, the second son\r\nof Cheops, no man is mentioned as the author or\r\nreviser of any Chapter or of any part of it ; certain\r\nChapters may shew the influence of the cult of a certain city or cities, but the Theban Book of the Dead,\r\nat all events, cannot be regarded as the work of\r\nany one man or body of men, and it does not represent the religious views and beliefs of any one part\r\nonly of Egypt . From time immemorial the god Thoth,\r\nwho was both the divine intelligence which at creation uttered the words that were carried into effect\r\nby Ptah and Khnemu, and the scribe of the gods,\r\nwas associated with the production of the Book of\r\nthe Dead, and, though he was primarily the god of\r\ntime and chronologer of heaven and earth, he appears frequently as the advocate and helper of the\r\ndeceased . In the CLXXXIInd Chapter (see p . 341)\r\nhe is called the `scribe of right and truth who abo-\r\n\"minateth sin\", and again, \"Behold, he is the writing\r\n\"reed of the god Neb-er-tcher, the lord of laws, who\r\n\"giveth forth the speech of wisdom and understanding, whose words have dominion over the two lands\" .\r\nLXXVI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nOf himself the god says, \"I am Thoth, the lord of\r\n\"right and truth, who trieth the right and the truth\r\n\"for the gods, the judge of words in their essence,\r\n\"whose words triumph over violence . . . . I have\r\n\"made Rd. to set as Osiris, and Osiris setteth as R i .\r\n\"setteth\" . The deeds which Thoth claims to have\r\ndone on behalf of Osiris are set forth at length in\r\nthe two hymns to Osiris which form the CLXXXIInd\r\nand CLXXXIIIrd Chapters (see p . 34o ff.) . In several\r\nplaces in the Book of the Dead the deceased is made\r\nto refer to the \"might of the words of the utterances\r\n\"of the god Thoth\", and much of what this god did\r\nfor \"his brother\" Osiris was effected by this power .\r\nThe belief in the efficacy of the words of Thoth continued till the latest period, for in the Book of Breathings\r\n(see p . CXCVII) we read, \"Thoth, the most mighty god,\r\n\"the lord of Khemennu, cometh to thee, and he writeth\r\n\"for thee the Book of Breathings with his own fingers\" .\r\nFinally, mention must be made of the various places\r\nin the tomb where the papyri inscribed with the Chapters of the Book of the Dead were placed . When the\r\nEgyptians ceased to cut the Chapters on the walls\r\nof the chambers and passages of pyramids, they wrote\r\nor painted them upon the sides, inner and outer, of\r\nwooden coffins, and this custom obtained until the\r\nend of the rule of the native kings of Egypt, about\r\nB . C. 350 ; the Vignettes were copied upon coffins,\r\nlong after all knowledge of their meaning had been\r\nforgotten, until as late as the third century of our\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . LXXVII\r\nera . The inscribed papyrus was sometimes placed in\r\na separate box beside the coffin, and sometimes a\r\nniche in the wall was specially cut for it ; the most\r\nperfect of the papyri known have been found in niches .\r\nFrequently the papyrus was laid by the side of the\r\nmummy in the coffin, and in this case it is usually\r\nfound broken by the movements of the mummy when\r\nthe coffin was carried along . More frequently the\r\npapyrus was laid under the hands and between the\r\nthighs before the final swathing took place ; it was\r\nalso placed between the legs just above the ankles .\r\nSuch papyri are usually much broken, and they are\r\noften much discoloured by the moisture of the substances, bitumen, cedar oil, etc ., used in the process\r\nof embalmment . In the time of the greatest power of\r\nthe priests of Amen, in the twenty-first dynasty, large\r\nwooden figures of Osiris standing upon a pedestal\r\nwere made to serve as cases for the papyri,\r\nwhich were tightly rolled up and tied, and pushed\r\nup inside the figures through holes in the bottom of\r\nthe pedestals .' In later times, about B . C . 3oo, the\r\nfigures were made solid, and vertical cavities were\r\ncut in the backs of them to hold the papyri ; still\r\nlater, i. c ., in the Roman period, when the papyri\r\nbecame very small, they were laid in cavities in the\r\nsides of the pedestals, which also contained mummified portions wrapped in linen of the bodies of the\r\ni . A good example of this class of figure, that of Anhai, a priestess\r\nof Amen, is figured in my Mummy, p. 216 .\r\nLXXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\npersons for whom they were made . Over the mummified remains, which are placed in the upper parts of\r\nthe pedestals, we often find small models of sepulchral\r\nchests or coffins surmounted by figures of Anubis and\r\nhawks . The figure of the god above is no longer that\r\nof Osiris simply, but it represents the triune god PtahSeker-Ausar, the god of the resurrection, and has all\r\nthe attributes which belong to the ancient gods Ptah\r\nand Seker . In this trinity the creator of the world,\r\nthe sun, and Osiris as god of the dead were represented . Some think that Ptah in this trinity represents\r\nthe personification of the period of incubation which\r\nfollows death and precedes the entry into eternal life .\r\nThe exact position of Seker cannot be definitely described ; he is usually depicted as a mummied body\r\nwith the head of a hawk, and he sometimes holds in\r\nhis hands the emblems of power, rule, and sovereignty which belong to Osiris ; he is said to be the\r\nincarnation of the Apis bull at Memphis .\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION .\r\nIt will be noticed in reading the translation of the\r\nBook of the Dead given in this volume that the deceased is always identified with the god Osiris, and\r\nthat he is frequently called by the god's name . And\r\nif the religious texts written for the benefit of the\r\ndead in all periods be examined it will be found that\r\nfrom the fifth dynasty to the latest times Osiris is\r\nalways regarded as the king and god of the dead,\r\nand that Egyptian writers always assume the identity\r\nof the blessed dead with their god . Thus in the text\r\ninscribed on the Pyramid of Unas ` the writer identifies the king with the god Osiris and says to the god\r\nTem, \"0 Tem, behold thy son, this motionless Osiris,\r\n\"thou hast given him that whereon he may live. If\r\n\"he liveth this Unas liveth ; if he dieth not, this Unas\r\n\"dieth not ; if he perisheth not, this Unas perisheth not ;\r\n\"if he begetteth not, this Unas begetteth not ; if he be-\r\n\"getteth, this Unas begetteth .\" And throughout the rei . Lines 240, 241 .\r\nLXXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nligious literature the deceased always claims that whatever was done by the gods for Osiris should also be\r\ndone for him by them . The hymns addressed to Rd\r\nand other great gods dwell more on the majesty and\r\npower which they exhibit in heaven and upon earth\r\nthan upon their goodness to man ; but with Osiris\r\nthe case is different, and it is evident that in the\r\nearliest period he was regarded more in the light of a\r\ngod who could be known, and who was known more\r\nor less personally if we may use the word-and he\r\nwas of all the gods the one singled out to receive the\r\npetitions of mankind for everlasting life .\r\nIt is impossible to say when Osiris began to be\r\nregarded as the god of the dead, and it is only from\r\nbrief allusions that any history of him can be formed .\r\nThroughout the Egyptian texts it is assumed that the\r\ngod suffered death and mutilation at the hands of his\r\nenemies ; that the various members of his body were\r\nscattered about the land of Egypt ; that his sisterwife Isis sought him sorrowing and at length found\r\nhim ; that she fanned him with her wings and gave\r\nhim air ; that she raised up his body and was united\r\nunto him ; that she conceived and brought forth a\r\nchild (Horus) ; and that he (Osiris) became the god\r\nand king of the underworld . In the legend of Osiris\r\nas given by Plutarch (De Iside et Osiride) it is said\r\nthat he was murdered at the instigation of Typhon\r\nor Set, who tore the body into fourteen pieces, which\r\nhe scattered throughout the land ; Isis collected these\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION .\r\n\r\nLXXXI\r\npieces, and wherever she found one she built a tomb .\r\nAfter the death of Osiris, his son Horus did battle\r\nwith Typhon his father's murderer, and, in the words\r\nof the Egyptians, \"avenged his father\" . Notwithstanding the death and mutilation which the god suffered the Egyptians firmly believed that he rose from\r\nthe dead with a body perfect in all its members, and\r\nthat corruption and decay had no power over him .\r\nThis fact may be deduced from a large number of\r\npassages in texts of all periods, but in one in particular which forms part of Chapter CLIV of the Book\r\nof the Dead' a definite statement of it occurs . The\r\ndeceased says to Osiris, \"Do thou embalm these my\r\n\"members, for I would not perish and come to an\r\n\"end, [but would be] even like unto my divine father\r\n\"Khepera, who is the divine type of him that never\r\n\"saw corruption\tLet not my body become\r\n\"worms but deliver me as thou didst deliver thyself\r\nHomage to thee, 0 my divine father Osiris,\r\n\"thou hast thy being with thy members . Thou didst\r\n\"not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou didst\r\n\"not waste away, thou didst not become corruption,\r\n\"thou didst not putrefy, and thou didst not turn into\r\n\"worms. I am the god Khepera, and my members\r\n\"shall have an everlasting existence . I shall not decay,\r\n\"I shall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I shall not turn\r\n\"into worms, and I shall not see corruption beneath\r\ni . See infra, p . e82 f .\r\nf\r\nLXXXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"the eye of the god Shu . I shall have my being, I\r\n\"shall have my being . I shall live, I shall live . I shall\r\n\"germinate, I shall germinate, I shall germinate . I shall\r\n\"wake up in peace ; I shall not putrefy ; my intestines\r\n\"shall not perish ; I shall not suffer from any defect ;\r\n\"mine eye shall not decay ; the form of my visage\r\n\"shall not disappear ; mine ear shall not become deaf ;\r\n\"my head shall not be separated from my neck ; my\r\n\"tongue shall not be carried away ; my hair shall\r\n\"not be cut off ; mine eyebrows shall not be shaved\r\n\"off ; and no baleful injury shall come upon me . My\r\n\"body shall be stablished, and it shall neither fall\r\n\"into decay nor be destroyed upon this earth\" . The\r\noldest copy of this Chapter is inscribed upon one of\r\nthe wrappings of the mummy of Thothmes III, who\r\nreigned about B . C . i55o, and the latest is found in\r\nthe Turin Papyrus (edited by Lepsius in 1842), which\r\ndates from the Ptolemaic period . From these extracts\r\nwe see that the deceased bases his certainty of an\r\neverlasting life, which was to be lived in a body\r\nwhich was perfect in all its members, upon the assurance that Osiris died, and rose again, and lived\r\nin a body which was perfect in all its members ;\r\nand it followed for the Egyptian that if Osiris did\r\nnot die and rise again his belief in a resurrection\r\nwas vain . It is difficult to say with certainty whether\r\nthe ancient Egyptian believed that Osiris endured\r\npain and suffered death on his behalf or not ; but it\r\nis quite clear that he believed there was some very\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII\r\ndefinite connexion between the resurrection of Osiris\r\nand of himself, and also that the god was able to raise\r\nhim up and to give him everlasting life, because he\r\nhimself had conquered death and risen, and had become the master of everlasting life . If the legend of\r\nPlutarch, which states that Osiris was once a man\r\nwho lived upon earth, really represents an Egyptian\r\nbelief we may, perhaps, conclude that the manhood\r\nwhich was common to the god and to the suppliant\r\nsupplied the reason why the prayers which are put\r\ninto the mouth of the dead are always addressed to\r\nOsiris. At all events, closer personal relations existed\r\nbetween man and Osiris than between man and any\r\nother god ; moreover, for countless generations he\r\nwas the type and emblem of the resurrection, and,\r\nrelying upon his power to give immortality to man,\r\nuntold generations lived and died . The ceremonies\r\nconnected with the celebration of the sufferings, death,\r\nand resurrection of Osiris were performed with great\r\nsolemnity, and it has been thought that a representation of them took place annually in certain of his\r\nshrines.\r\nThe forms in which Osiris is depicted on the monuments and in papyri are very numerous, but we need\r\nonly refer here to those which concern him in his\r\ncharacter as king, god, and judge of the dead . In\r\npapyri he is seated on a throne within a covered\r\nshrine ; his form is that of a bearded mummy wearing the atef crown, and he holds in his hands the\r\nf*\r\nLXXXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncrook and flail (or whip), emblems of sovereignty and\r\ndominion . On the side of the throne (which rests\r\nupon a pedestal made in the form of . the symbol of that which is straight or right,) is the emblem\r\nof the union of Southern and Northern Egypt, which\r\ntypifies the sovereignty of the god over the whole\r\nland ; the throne is sometimes placed upon water,\r\nwherein we may probably see the origin-of the tradition of certain Eastern peoples which makes the\r\nthrone of the Deity to rest above running water . Behind him frequently stand the goddesses Isis and\r\nNephthys, and facing him, standing upon a lotus\r\nflower, are the four children of Horus (see p . 14) . Thus seated praise was offered to him in these\r\nwords : \"Glory be to thee, Osiris Un-nefer, the\r\n\"great god within Abydos, king of eternity, lord of\r\n\"the everlasting, who passeth through millions of\r\n\"years in his existence\" (p . i i) . \"Praise be unto thee,\r\n\"0 Osiris, lord of eternity, Un-nefer, Harmachis,\r\n\"whose forms are manifold, and whose attributes are\r\n\"majestic . . . . Those who have lain down (i. c ., the\r\n\"dead) rise up to see thee, they breathe the air and\r\n\"they look upon thy face when the disk riseth on its\r\n\"horizon ; their hearts are at peace inasmuch as they\r\n\"behold thee, 0 thou who art Eternity and Everlast-\r\n\"ingness\" (p . 34) . In an address to Osiris by Thoth\r\nwhich forms the CLXXXIInd Chapter of the Book of\r\n.the Dead (see p . 340) he is said to be the \"Governor\r\nof those who are in the underworld\", and \"to make\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXV\r\nmen and women to be born again\", the new birth\r\nbeing the birth into the life which is beyond the\r\ngrave ; and being himself everlasting he had power\r\nto bestow eternal existence upon his followers .\r\nConcerning the form in which Osiris rose from the\r\ndead the texts are silent, and nothing is said as to the\r\nnature of his body in the underworld ; that he dwelt\r\nin the material body which was his upon earth there\r\nis no reason whatever to suppose, for there are indications in the texts which point to a definite belief\r\nin the resurrection of a spiritual body, both in the\r\ncase of the god and of men . Before, however, this\r\npoint is touched upon reference must be made to the\r\nideas which the Egyptians held concerning the component parts of man's entity, material, spiritual, and\r\nmental. The physical or material body, called hhat,\r\nwas liable to decay, and could only be preserved by\r\nmummifying ; both gods and man possessed bodies of\r\nthis nature. When the material body had been brought\r\nto the tomb for burial, provided that the prescribed\r\nprayers had been said over it and the proper ceremonies had been duly performed by the priests, it\r\nacquired the power of sending forth from itself a body,\r\ncalled salnr, which was able to ascend to heaven and\r\nto dwell with the gods there . The only suitable rendering for the word shrhu is \"spiritual body\", and this\r\nmeaning fits very well into the translation of the texts\r\nwhere the word is found . The educated Egyptian\r\nnever believed that the material body would rise\r\nLXXXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nagain and take up a new life, for he well understood\r\nthat flesh and blood could not inherit immortality . It\r\nhas been urged by some that the custom of mummifying the dead, which obtained throughout Egypt for\r\nso many thousands of years, was maintained because\r\nthe Egyptian believed in the resurrection of the material body, but it is not so ; they mummified their\r\ndead simply because they believed that spiritual bodies\r\nwould \"germinate\" in them . In several places it is\r\ndistinctly said that the \"soul is in heaven, and the\r\nbody upon earth\",' and even the dead body of Osiris\r\nhimself rested upon earth in Heliopolis (see p . 290) ;\r\nelsewhere' it is said to the deceased, \"Thy soul is\r\n\"in heaven before Ra, thy KA hath what should be\r\n\"given to it with the gods, thy saxu bath power (or\r\n\"is glorious) with the KHUS, and thy body (khat) is\r\n\"stablished in the underworld It is possible\r\nthat certain simple folk may have been led to believe\r\nthat because meat offerings and drink offerings in\r\nabundance were taken to the tombs the deceased\r\nmust naturally partake of them, and it is more than\r\nprobable that the Egyptians in a semi-savage state\r\nmade such offerings because they believed them necessary for their dead .\r\nThe offerings taken to the tomb were intended for\r\nthe ka of the deceased. The word ka has formed the\r\nsubject of several learned dissertations by various schoi . Among others see Recueil de Travaux, t . IV . P . 71 (1 . 582) .\r\n2 . Lieblein, Que mon nom eurisse, p . 2, 1 . z ff. and p . 17, 1 . z ff.\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nLXXXVII\r\nlars, and it is now generally rendered by \"double\" ; it\r\nhas its equivalent in the Coptic nw and in the Greek\r\nE t~coX ', and in certain places may be rendered by\r\nall the meanings of these equivalents . This abstract\r\nindividuality or personality possessed all the attributes\r\nof the man himself, and, though its normal dwellingplace was in the tomb along with the body, it could\r\nwander about at will ; it was independent of the man\r\nto whom it belonged and could even go and dwell\r\nin the statue of a man . The ka could both eat and\r\ndrink, and at a very early period a small chamber\r\nwas specially prepared for it in the hall of the tomb ;\r\nthis was provided with an opening through which it\r\nmight snuff the smell of the incense and other offerings made therein, and it was the duty of certain\r\nmembers of the priesthood to minister duly and regularly to its needs . When actual offerings failed it\r\nwould seem that the ka fed upon those which were\r\npainted or sculptured upon the walls and altars in\r\nthe tomb, and when these were wanting it appears\r\nthat it might even be reduced to eating offal and\r\ndrinking filthy water .\r\nConnected in some inexplicable way with the ka\r\nwas the 6a, or soul, which according to some texts\r\nis said to eat of the funeral offerings along with the\r\nka, in whom or with whom it was supposed to dwell,\r\nbut according to others it ascended into heaven where\r\nit lived with Rd and the beatified (lead. From one\r\npoint of view it is not a material thing, and from\r\nLX XXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nanother it is a tangible thing ; it is depicted as a\r\nhuman-headed hawk, and in a Vignette in the Papyrus\r\nof Nebqet (ed . Deveria and Pierret, pl . 3) it is seen\r\nflying down the funeral pit bearing air and food to\r\nthe mummified body, lying in the mummy chamber,\r\nto which it belongs . The 6a could leave its place in\r\nheaven and visit the body whenever it pleased, and\r\nit had power to assume any form which it pleased .\r\nCertain of the characteristics of the ba were shared\r\nby the heart, rib, which was believed to be the source\r\nboth of life and of good and evil in man . The preservation of the heart was of the first importance,\r\nand several Chapters of the Book of the Dead were\r\ncomposed with the object of keeping it out of the\r\nclutches of the \"stealers of hearts\" . In the Judgment\r\nScene it is the one member of the body which is\r\nsingled out for special examination, and the large\r\nnumbers of heart amulets which are preserved in the\r\nnational collections of Egyptian antiquities testify to\r\nthe anxiety which the Egyptians felt as to its security.\r\nWith the ba, or soul, the khaibit, or shadow, is\r\noften mentioned, and it seems to have been nourished\r\nby the offerings which were made in the tomb of the\r\nman to whom it belonged . It had an existence apart\r\nfrom the body, and like the ka, or double, it could\r\nwander wherever it pleased . An interesting passage\r\nconcerning the shadow is found in the XCIInd Chapter\r\nof the Book of the Dead where the deceased prays :-\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION. LXXXIX\r\n\"0 keep not captive my soul, 0 keep not ward over\r\n\"my shadow, but let a way be opened for my soul\r\n\"and for my shadow, and let them see the Great\r\n\"God in the shrine on the day of the judgment of\r\n\"souls, and let them recite the utterances of Osiris,\r\n\"whose habitations are hidden, to those who guard\r\n\"the members of Osiris, and who keep ward over the\r\n\"Nits, and who hold captive the shadows of the dead\r\n\"who would work evil against me\" (see p . 152).\r\nAnother integral part of a man was the khu, or\r\n\"shining\", translucent covering(?) of the spiritual body,\r\nwhich dwelt in heaven with the gods . It is difficult\r\nto explain its exact relationship to the double, and\r\nthe soul, and the heart, and the shadow, but in certain passages in which the word occurs it seems as\r\nif it had some close connexion with the soul, for it\r\nis mentioned along with it .\r\nIn several passages, both in early and late texts,\r\nthe sekhem of a man is mentioned with the 6a, or\r\nsoul, and sometimes with both the ka, or double, and\r\nthe ba. One of the meanings of sekhem is \"form\" or\r\n\"statue\", but another meaning is \"power\", and it\r\nseems as if the Egyptians conceived the idea of the\r\npower or vital force of a man living, with him in\r\nheaven . The gods were supposed to possess doubles,\r\nand souls, and shadows, and hearts, and khus,\u2022 but\r\nit is doubtful if they were endowed with sekhemu ;\r\nit is probable that they were not ; many of them\r\nwere themselves sekhemnu or \"Powers\".\r\nXC\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nThere remains now but one attribute of a man to\r\nmention, and that is the ren or name ; in Egypt a\r\nman took the most extraordinary precautions to prevent his name from being blotted out, for it was the\r\ncommon belief that unless the name of a person were\r\npreserved he ceased to exist. Already in the Pyramid\r\ntexts, as Dr. Wiedemann has pointed out' we find\r\nthe deceased making supplication that his name may\r\nflourish (literally, germinate) along with the names of\r\nTem, Shu, Seb, and other gods, and the same desire\r\nis expressed in texts from the sixth dynasty down to\r\nthe Roman period, when we find that a number of\r\npapyri were inscribed with invocations to one or more\r\ngods with the sole object of making to flourish 2 the\r\nnames of those for whom they were copied . The ren,\r\nor name, had some close connexion with the ka, or\r\ndouble, as may be seen from the passage in the text\r\nof Pepi L j\r\nThus we see that the sahlt, or spiritual body, the\r\nka, or double, the ba, or soul, the ab, or heart, the\r\nNit, or shining form, the sekhem, or vital force, and\r\nthe ren, or name, and the khaibit, or shade, were all\r\nbelieved to come into existence after death, and it\r\nseems that the various parts which we have enumeri . Recueil tie Travaux, tom . XVII, p . 17 .\r\na . An interesting collection of such documents was published by Lieblein in 1895 entitled Le &re Que mon nonz fleurisse.\r\n3 . \"Pepi passeth on with his flesh, Pepi is happy with his name, Pepi\r\nliveth with his ka\" (1 . 169) .\r\nOSIRIS AND THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\nXCI\r\nated together made up the spiritual body which \"germinated\" in the khal or material body . There is little\r\ndoubt that the beliefs in the existence of these various\r\nmembers of the spiritual body are not all of the same\r\nage, and they probably represent several stages of intellectual development on the part of the Egyptian ; their\r\norigin and development it is now impossible to trace,\r\nfor already in the fifth and sixth dynasties their existence is accepted as an accomplished fact .\r\nA question naturally arises at this point, as to\r\nwhen this spiritual body began its existence ; but\r\nunfortunately no satisfactory answer can at present\r\nbe given to it, for no text yet discovered supplies\r\nthe necessary information . It is natural to suppose\r\nthat the sdh-it, or spiritual body, came into being as\r\na result of the prayers which were recited on the\r\nday of the burial of the mummified body, and of the\r\nceremonies which were performed at the same time .\r\nOn the other hand, there exist distinct proofs that\r\nthe Egyptians believed in a judgment which was to\r\nbe held in the domain of Osiris, and we should hardly\r\nexpect the spiritual body to begin its career until\r\nafter the trial of the heart in the Balance, and until\r\nthe verdict of the gods at this Judgment was favourable to the deceased . The whole question is full of\r\ndifficulty, chiefly because the Egyptians themselves\r\ndid not, I imagine, form definite ideas on such subjects, or if they did, they did not put them in writing. It is, however, perfectly certain that they be-\r\nXCII\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nlieved that Osiris had the power to make men to\r\nbe born after death into a new life, and that such\r\nlife was everlasting ; and they ascribed to him this\r\npower because he had himself suffered death and\r\nmutilation and had risen from the dead .\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\nAn examination of the papyri inscribed with the\r\nTheban Recension of the Book of the Dead shews\r\nthat they may be divided into two classes, viz., (1)\r\nthose in which the Chapters of Coming forth by Day\r\nare preceded by Introductory Hymns to Rd and Osiris,\r\nand by a Judgment Scene, and (2) those in which they\r\nare preceded by a simple Vignette in which the god\r\nOsiris is seen seated within a shrine . The oldest papyri of the eighteenth dynasty' lack such Introductory\r\nHymns and the Judgment Scene, which appear most\r\noften in the illuminated papyri of the last half of the\r\neighteenth dynasty ; they continue in the nineteenth\r\ndynasty, but frequently in a less full form . In the\r\nolder Recensions of the Book of the Dead there is no\r\nattempt to describe the judgment pictorially, and although it is pretty certain that every Egyptian believed\r\nthat he would be judged after death, there is no definite statement of the fact . It will be noticed that a\r\ni . E. g., the Papyrus of Nebseni and the Papyrus of Nu .\r\nXC I V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nsection of Chapter XXX B contains the words, \"My\r\n\"heart, my mother ; my heart, my mother! My heart\r\n\"whereby I came into being! May naught stand up to\r\n\"oppose me at my judgment ; may there be no opposition to me in the presence of the sovereign princes\r\n\"[of Osiris] ; may there be no parting of thee from\r\n\"me in the presence of him that keepeth the Balance\"\r\n(see p. 79) . \"Let there be joy of heart unto us at the\r\n\"weighing of words . Let not that which is false be\r\n\"uttered against me before the great god, the lord\r\n\"of Amentet\" (see p . 80). Here clearly we have suggested the idea of weighing the heart, as the symbol\r\nof the seat of life and the source of good and evil\r\nactions, and as a matter of fact the Vignette of the\r\nChapter, which first appears in the eighteenth dynasty, represents the deceased sitting in one pan of\r\nthe scales and being weighed against his heart which\r\nis placed in the other . It is not easy to say exactly\r\nwhat belief underlies this Vignette, but it seems to\r\nindicate that the guardian of the scale weighed the\r\nbody to see if it had carried out properly the heart's\r\ndirections, and that if it had done so it would counterbalance exactly the heart, and the beam of the scales\r\nwould be straight . This testing of the body or heart,\r\nor both, took place in the presence of Osiris on the\r\nday when \"words were weighed\" .\r\nIn the Papyrus of Ani (sheet 3 i) four small Vignettes accompany the Negative Confession, which\r\nforms part of the CXXVth Chapter, and in one of\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nXCV\r\nthese we see the heart of the deceased in one pan\r\nof the balance, and a feather, emblematic of Right\r\nand Truth, i . e ., \"what is straight\", in the other. The\r\ngod Anubis is testing the tongue of the balance, and\r\nclose by stands the monster Am-met or \"eater of the\r\ndead\" . Here we have a proof that in addition to the\r\nweighing of a man's body against his heart, the heart\r\nitself was weighed against Right and Truth, and that\r\nthis stage of the judgment also took place in the\r\npresence of the god Osiris, the judge of the dead .\r\nIn the eighteenth dynasty, if not earlier, the idea of\r\nthe judgment took great hold upon the minds of the\r\nEgyptians, and it found expression in the large and\r\nelaborate Vignette which is prefixed to the copies of\r\nthe Chapters of Coming Forth by Day which were\r\nmade at this period ; it is, however, impossible to\r\nsay whether the large Vignette is a development of\r\nthat which accompanies the CXXVth Chapter, or\r\nwhether each had a distinct origin . When once the\r\nidea of the great judgment Scene had developed itself\r\nit seems to have been felt that the deceased ought\r\nnot to enter into the Hall of judgment without having\r\nfirst uttered words of prayer and praise to the great\r\ngods Rat and Osiris, to the former as the greatest of\r\nthe cosmic gods, and to the latter as the judge and\r\ngod of the dead ; hence were composed the Introductory Hymns to Ra and Osiris, of which several\r\nexamples are known.\r\nIn the hymns to Ra the deceased apostrophizes\r\nXC V I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe glory and majesty of the One god, the creator\r\nof the world and all that therein is, who manifests\r\nhimself to his creatures under the form of the sun,\r\nby whose heat and light men and women, beasts and\r\nfeathered fowl, fish and creeping things, trees and\r\nherbs have their being . The darkness of night into\r\nwhich the sun disappeared when he set was personified as an enemy of the sun, and the daily victory\r\nof light over darkness was hymned with gladness by\r\nhis worshippers . From one point of view the Egyptian regarded the course of the sun as a type of his\r\nown life, and day symbolized life and night death ;\r\nthe conflict in which the sun engaged with the powers\r\nof darkness typified the struggle of the deceased with\r\nhis enemies in the underworld, and man hoped that\r\nhe would overcome them even as the sun vanquished\r\nall who opposed his course . In a fine hymn (see p . io)\r\nthe deceased says :- \"O thou beautiful Being, thou\r\n\"dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of the\r\n\"Disk within thy mother Hathor ; therefore in every\r\n\"place every heart swelleth with joy at thy rising\r\n\"eternally\t0 Ra, the divine man-child, the heir\r\n\"of eternity, self-begotten and self-born, prince of the\r\n\"Tuat, governor of the regions of Aukert, . . . thou\r\n\"god of life, thou lord of love, all men live when\r\n\"thou shinest ; thou art crowned king of the gods .\r\n\"Those who are in thy following sing unto thee with\r\n\"joy and bow down their foreheads to the earth\r\n\"when they meet thee, thou lord of heaven, thou lord\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nXC\\'II\r\n\"of earth, thou king of Right and Truth, thou lord\r\n\"of eternity, thou prince of everlastingness, thou sovereign of all the gods, thou god of life, thou creator of eternity, thou maker of heaven wherein thou\r\n\"art firmly established .

The Serpent-fiend (i. e ., Darkness)\r\n\"hath fallen, his arms are hewn off, the knife hath\r\n\"cut asunder his joints . Ra liveth in unchanging and\r\n\"eternal law and order.\" Again, in another hymn\r\n(see p . 8) we read :- \"Thou risest, thou risest, thou\r\n\"shinest, thou shinest, thou art crowned king of the\r\n\"gods . Thou art the lord of heaven, thou art the lord\r\n\"of earth ; thou art the creator of beings celestial and\r\n\"of beings terrestrial .

Millions of years\r\n\"have gone over the world ; I cannot tell the number of those through which thou hast passed .\" From\r\nthese passages it is clear that the Egyptians believed\r\nthat the god who was typified by the sun was eternal, immortal, and unknown (i . invisible), that he\r\ncreated himself, and the world, and the beings and\r\nthings in it ; he was also One and Alone, and there\r\nwas none like unto him, for the gods, of whom he\r\nwas king, only possessed certain of his attributes and\r\ncharacteristics . It has been denied by some that his\r\noneness or unity is the same as the unity of God\r\nAlmighty, though I believe there is no good reason\r\nfor this view ; but whether it be or not it is perfectly certain that when the Egyptians declared that\r\ntheir god was One they meant exactly what the Hebrews meant when they declared that Jehovah was\r\nOne,' and what the Arabs meant, and still mean when\r\ni . \"Hear, 0 Israel, Adonai our God is God One\" (\u201E;.) Deuteronomy VI. 4 .\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nXCIX\r\nthey cry out that Allah is One .' At all events the\r\nOne god of the Egyptians possessed all the essential\r\nattributes of the Christian's God .\r\nIn the hymns to Osiris the deceased enumerates\r\nthe various titles of the god and mentions his most\r\nancient shrines. Osiris is declared to be the son of\r\nSeb, the earth-god, and of Nut, the sky-goddess, and\r\n\"as prince of gods and men\" to have \"received the\r\ncrook, and the whip, and the dignity of his divine\r\nfathers\" ; he is the king of eternity and lord of everlastingness, and his existence is for millions of years .\r\nIn his name \"Osiris\" he is most terrible, and he endureth for ever in his name \"Un-nefer\". Though\r\npossessing the attribute of eternal which is ascribed\r\nto Rd he is not \"self-begotten and self-born\" like that\r\ngod ; Ra has no offspring in the human sense of the\r\nword, but Osiris begot a son (after his death, according to one legend), who succeeded to his father's\r\nthrone upon earth and \"avenged\" him on Set his\r\nmurderer. From Ra the deceased asks only that he\r\nmay behold him \"at dawn each day\" (see p . 9), but\r\nfrom Osiris he asks (see p . I2) that his ka, or double,\r\nmay have \"splendour in heaven, and might upon\r\nearth, and triumph in the underworld\". And he adds,\r\n\"May I sail down to Tattu (Mendes or Busiris) like\r\n\"a living soul and up to Abtu (Abydos) like a Bciriru\r\ni . \"He God is One ( awl d,1Jl .n) ; the eternal God ; he begetteth not,\r\nneither is he begotten ; and there is not any one like unto him\" .

The Vignette\r\nof the Judgment Scene varies in detail greatly in the\r\nvarious papyri, though the essential parts of it are always preserved ; the fullest form known of it is given\r\nin the Papyrus of Ani and may be thus described :-\r\nIn one portion of a chamber in the domain of Osiris,\r\nwhich we may assume to be the Hall of the Double\r\nMaat, or Right and Truth, a balance is set wherein\r\nthe heart of the deceased is to be weighed ; the beam\r\nof the balance is suspended upon a projection from the\r\nstandard made in the form of the feather which symbolizes Right and Truth . Upon the beam of the balance sits the dog-headed ape which was associated\r\nwith Thoth, the scribe of the gods. The weighing of\r\nthe heart is carried out in the presence of the company of the gods, which is here represented by the\r\nfollowing members of it :-\r\ni . Ra-Heru-Khuti, or Ra-I-Iarmachis, the great god\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCl\r\nwithin his boat .

Temu or Tem, the form of Ra at eventide . He\r\nwas the head of the company of gods at Heliopolis,\r\nand is always represented in human form.

Horus, the sun-god, who is to be distinguished\r\nfrom Horus the son of Isis . He is represented in\r\nhuman form but with the head of a hawk ; the hawk\r\nwas the symbol of Horns, and the worship of that\r\nbird is probably the oldest in Egypt .\r\nio. Hathor, the goddess of that portion of the sky\r\nwherein Horns the sun-god rose and set .\r\ni i . Hu and Sa, two gods who had their places in\r\nthe boat of the sun at creation .\r\nIt will be noticed that several of the gods, e .g.,\r\nNu, Ptah, Khnemu, Khepera, Set, Anpu, Ap-uat,\r\nAmsu, Hapi, and several goddesses, c . r., Madt, Nit,\r\nSekhet, Bast, Serq, Uatchit,' are not here represented ; the explanation of this fact is that only the gods\r\nand the goddesses of the funeral company of Osiris\r\nare considered to be interested in the judgment of\r\nthe dead.\r\nOn one side of the scale we see the god Anubis\r\ntesting the tongue of the balance, and behind him\r\nstand Thoth, the scribe of the gods, writing down\r\nthe result of the weighing, and the tri-formed 2 beast\r\nAm-mit, the \"Eater of the Dead\", who is waiting to\r\ndevour the heart of Ani should it be found light in\r\nthe balance . On the other side of the balance are\r\nAni's \"luck\" or \"destiny\" ; an object called zzzesk\/zen\r\nwhich has been described as a \"cubit with human\r\ni . For descriptions of these deities see my Papyrus of Am, p . CVII f.\r\n2 . One-third crocodile, one-third lion, and one-third hippopotamus .\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCIII\r\nhead\", it either typifies the embryo, or has some\r\nconnexion with the birth of Ani ; his soul in the form\r\nof a human-headed bird perched upon a pylon ; and\r\nbehind these are the goddesses Renenet and Meskhenet who presided over Ani's birth-chamber and\r\nrearing . Behind these stand Ani himself and his wife\r\nThuthu with heads reverently bent . Ani is here depicted in human form, and wearing garments and\r\nornaments similar to those which he wore upon earth .\r\nIt is quite clear that the body which he has in this\r\nHall of judgment cannot be the body with which he\r\nhad been endowed upon earth, and we are probably\r\nto understand that it is his spiritual body, wearing the\r\nwhite robes of the beatified dead in the world beyond\r\nthe grave, which we see . He is perfect in all his\r\nmembers, which are endowed with the strength and\r\npower that belong to those who have risen in a spiritual or glorified body from the dead . Though he\r\nstands at the entrance of the Hall and the weighing\r\nof the heart has not yet taken place, the artist depicted him in the form in which it was always assumed\r\nthe just would appear before Osiris . The heart having\r\nbeen placed in one pan of the scales and the feather,\r\nsymbolic of truth, in the other, Ani utters the words\r\nwhich form Chapter XXX ii of the Book of the Dead\r\n(see p . i9) wherein he prays that there may be no\r\nparting of his heart from him in the presence of the\r\nguardian of the Balance . This done, Anubis tests the\r\ntongue of the balance, and finds that the beam is\r\nC I V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nexactly straight and that the heart balances the feather exactly ; the dog-headed ape seated on the standard reports this to Thoth, who, standing with his\r\nwriting-reed in hand, is ready to note the result and\r\nto declare it to the gods . It is interesting to observe\r\nthat the heart was only required to balance the feather and not to outweigh it, a fact which indicates\r\nthat the pious Egyptian was supposed to be able to\r\nsatisfy the demands and requirements of the law, and\r\nthat he took his stand in the judgment and hoped\r\nfor acquittal by virtue of the good deeds which he\r\nhad done in the body .\r\nThe god Thoth next addressed the company of the\r\ngods as follows : \"Hear ye this judgment. The heart\r\n\"of Osiris hath in very truth been weighed, and his\r\n\"soul bath stood as a witness for him ; it bath been\r\n\"found true by trial in the Great Balance . There hath\r\n\"not been found any wickedness in him ; he bath not\r\n\"wasted the offerings in the temples ; he hath not\r\n\"done harm by his deeds ; and he spread no evil\r\n`reports [about men] while he was upon earth .\" To\r\nthis speech the gods reply : \"That which cometh forth\r\n\"from thy mouth [0 Thoth, dwelling in Khemennu,]\r\n\"is confirmed. Osiris, the scribe Ani, is holy and\r\n`\u00B0righteous. He hath not sinned, neither bath he done\r\n\"evil against us . The devourer A .memet shall not be\r\n\"allowed to prevail over him, and meat-offerings and\r\n\"entrance into the presence of the god Osiris shall\r\n\"be granted unto him, together with a homestead for\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nCV\r\n\"ever in Sekhet-hetepu, as unto the followers of\r\n\"Horus.\" '\r\nThe gods confirm the report of Thoth, and Ani,\r\nhaving been found just, is led into the presence of\r\nOsiris by \"Horus the son of Isis\" . The words \"found\r\njust\" represent in a measure the words ntaa khef-u\r\n(masc.) or uncut khcrtt (fem .) which are always added\r\nafter the name of the deceased in funeral texts ; there\r\nis no example of their application to a living person .\r\nMuch has been written about them, and many renderings have been suggested for them, such as \"true\r\nof voice\", \"justified\", \"triumphant\", \"victorious\" ; they\r\nactually mean \"right\" (itaa) and \"word\" (cheru), and\r\nseem to be meant to express the belief on the part\r\nof the writer that the deceased has satisfactorily passed\r\nthe ordeal of judgment, and that he has attained to\r\nthe state in which his commands, whatever they may\r\nbe, will be carried out duly and effectually .\r\nWhile Horus is leading Ani into the presence of\r\nhis father he addresses Osiris, saying, \"I have come\r\n\"unto thee, 0 Un-nefer, and I have brought the Osiris\r\n\"Ani unto thee . His heart hath been [found] righteous coming forth from the balance, and it hath not\r\n\"sinned against any god or goddess. Thoth hath\r\n\"weighed it according to the decree uttered unto\r\ni . The Heru-shesu, or followers of Horus, are a class of mythological\r\nbeings or demi-gods who already in the Pyramid Texts are supposed to\r\nrecite prayers on behalf of the deceased, and to assist Horus and Set in\r\n\"opening his mouth\" . For a description of this ceremony, see my Papyrus\r\nof An i, p . 26, f.\r\nC V I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"him by the company of the gods ; and it is very true\r\n\"and righteous. Grant unto him cakes and ale ; and\r\n\"let him enter into the presence of Osiris (1. e ., into\r\n\"thy presence) ; and may he be like unto the fol-\r\n\"lowers of Horns for ever .\" In the last division of\r\nthe Judgment Scene we see Ani kneeling by a table\r\nof offerings placed before the shrine of the god Osiris,\r\nto whom he says, \"0 lord of Amentet, I am in thy\r\n\"presence . There is no sin in me, I have not lied\r\n\"wittingly, nor have I (lone au-ht with a false heart .\r\n\"Grant that I may be like unto those favoured ones\r\n\"who are round about thee, and that I may be an\r\n\"Osiris greatly favoured of the beautiful god and be-\r\n\"loved of the lord of the world, [I] the royal scribe\r\n\"indeed, who loveth him, Ani, triumphant before the\r\n\"god Osiris .\" It will be noticed that Ani now has\r\nhis hair whitened, and that he wears upon his head\r\nthe object which is called a cone, the signification of\r\nwhich is unknown . He has at length penetrated to\r\nthe throne of \"Osiris, the lord of eternity''-as the\r\nwords written above him read and Ani's petition to\r\nthe god is that he may become \"an Osiris\", that is\r\nto say, a being endowed with a spiritual body which\r\ncan never again see death or suffer corruption . The\r\nanswer of Osiris is not given in the papyrus, nor is\r\nit, as far as I have seen, in any papyrus where a\r\nsimilar petition is made ; but just as it is always assumed that the heart of the deceased will always balance the feather of law or right and truth, so is it also\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nCVII\r\nassumed that the petition of the deceased will always\r\nbe favourably received, and that he will henceforth\r\nbe free to go about in the god's domains without\r\nlet or hindrance, and to participate in all the occupations of the great god himself. Thus the Judgment\r\nScene ends, and this section of the papyrus in which\r\nit is found is followed by the \"Chapters of Coming\r\nForth by Day\" .\r\nThe question naturally arises here : When did the\r\njudgment in the Hall of Osiris take place ? To this\r\nno definite answer can be given, for the reason that\r\nno text supplies the information needed . There are\r\nno grounds, so far as I see, for assuming that the\r\nEgyptians believed in a great general day of judgment when all the world shall be judged, and the\r\nwicked shall be punished, and the righteous shall be\r\nrewarded, or for thinking, as some have done, that\r\nthe mummified bodies were laid in the tomb to await\r\na general resurrection . On the contrary, all the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the judgment of each individual was thought to take place\r\nimmediately after death, and if this was the belief it\r\nfollows that punishment or reward was allotted to\r\nthe dead at once . The evil heart, . or the heart which\r\nhad failed to balance the feather symbolic of the law,\r\nwas given to the monster Am-mit to devour ; thus\r\npunishment consisted of instant annihilation, unless we\r\nimagine that the destruction of the heart was extended\r\nover an indefinite period . The difficulty of the sub-\r\nC V I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nject is further complicated when we come to consider\r\nthe use and object of the funeral ceremonies and\r\nprayers . If at his death the soul of a man passed\r\nto immediate judgment, what could the ceremonies\r\nand prayers of the priests avail it? We know that\r\nthe embalming of a body in the best and most expensive way occupied a period varying from seventy\r\nto about one hundred days, and that several more\r\ndays were necessary before the body was coffined\r\nand laid with the proper ceremonies in the tomb . If\r\nthe prayers which the priests recited and the ceremonies which they performed over it at the grave\r\nwere absolutely necessary for the future well-being\r\nof its soul, and if the soul could not begin its beatified existence until such prayers had been said and\r\nsuch ceremonies had been performed, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why such a lengthy process of embalmment was resorted to, for during the period which\r\nelapsed between death and burial the soul must have\r\ntarried in some intermediate place . In the absence\r\nof exact knowledge we can only assume that certain\r\nprayers were said for the benefit of the deceased immediately after death, and that such prayers assured\r\nhis acquittal in the Hall of Osiris, and procured for\r\nhim entrance into the abode of the blessed . This done,\r\nthe embalmment of the body might be carried out\r\nat the convenience of all concerned, and the elaborate and formal ceremonies connected with the sepulture of the great would follow in due course . The\r\nTHE JUDGMENT F THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCIX\r\nbeliefs which are connected with the judgment of the\r\ndead are so numerous and so conflicting, and belong\r\nto so many various periods of development of religious thought in Egypt that it is impossible to harmonize them ; as new nexts are discovered the difficulties will probably disappear one by one, and the\r\nfuture labours of Egyptologists will clear up many\r\nobscure passages which up to the present have been\r\nmisunderstood .\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN.\r\nAt a very early period in their history the Egyptians believed in the existence of a place wherein\r\nthe blessed dead led a life of happiness, the characteristics of which much resemble those of the life\r\nwhich he had led upon earth ; these characteristics\r\nare so similar that it is hard to believe that in the\r\nearly times the one life was not held to be a mere\r\ncontinuation of the other . At all events the delights and pleasures of this world were believed to\r\nbe forthcoming in the next, and a life there in a\r\nstate of happiness which depended absolutely upon\r\nmaterial things was contemplated . Such ideas date\r\nfrom the time when the Egyptians were in a semisavage state, and the preservation of them is probably due to their extreme conservatism in all matters connected with religion ; the remarkable point\r\nabout them is their persistence, for they occur in\r\ntexts which belong to periods when it was impossible\r\nfor the Egyptians to have attached any serious importance to them, and some of the coarsest ideas\r\nTHE EL YSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN\r\n\r\nCXI\r\nare in places mingled with the expression of lofty\r\nspiritual conceptions . In a passage in the text of\r\nUnas it is said of this king (1 . 623), \"Unas hath come\r\n\"to his pools which are on both sides of the stream\r\n\"of the goddess Meht-urt, and to the place of verdant offerings, and to the fields which are on the\r\n`horizon ; he hath made his fields on both sides of\r\n\"the horizon to be verdant . He hath brought the\r\n\"crystal to the Great Eye which is in the field, he\r\n\"hath taken his seat in the horizon, he riseth like\r\n\"Sebek the son of Neith, he eateth with his mouth,\r\n\"he voideth water, he enjoyeth the pleasures of love,\r\n\"and he is the begetter who carrieth away women\r\n\"from their husbands whenever it pleaseth him so to\r\n\"do\". And in the text of Teta (1 . 286f.) we read,\r\n\"Hail, Osiris Teta, Horus hath granted that Thoth\r\n\"shall bring thine enemy unto thee . He hath placed\r\n\"thee behind him that he may riot harm thee and\r\n\"that thou mayest make thy seat upon him, and that\r\n\"when coming forth thou mayest sit upon him so that\r\n\"he may not be able to force intercourse upon thee\" .\r\nThese passages give a very clear idea of the state\r\nof Egyptian morals when they were written, and they\r\nindicate the indignities to which those vanquished in\r\nwar, both male and female, were exposed at the\r\nhands of the conquerors .\r\nThe texts of the early period, as will be seen from\r\nthe extracts given further on, give a large amount\r\nof information about the pleasures of the deceased in\r\nC X I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe world beyond the grave, but no attempt to illustrate the employments of the blessed dead is given\r\nuntil the eighteenth dynasty, when the Vignette to\r\nthe CXth Chapter of the Book of the Dead was inserted in papyri . Here we have an idea given of the\r\nconception which the Egyptian formed of the place\r\n,,, herein he was to dwell after death . A homestead\r\nor farm, or country, intersected with canals is at\r\nonce his paradise and the home of the blessed dead,\r\nand the abode of the god of his city. This place is\r\ncalled Sekhet -Aaru or \"Field of Reeds\", and this\r\nname seems to indicate that the Egyptian placed his\r\nparadise in the north of Egypt, probably in some part\r\nof the Delta or in the islands of the sea still further\r\nnorth . Certain it is that the deceased prays several\r\ntimes that the \"sweet breath of the north wind\" may\r\nbe given unto him, and those who have experienced\r\nthe discomfort of a south wind on a hot day in\r\nEgypt will sympathize with him . The Field of Reeds,\r\nhowever, was but a portion of the district called\r\n\"Sekhet-Hetep\" or \"Sekhet-Hetepet\", or \"Fields of\r\nPeace\", over which there presided a number of gods,\r\nand here the deceased led a life which suggests that\r\nthe idea of the whole place originated with a nation\r\nof agriculturists . In the coloured Vignette which faces\r\nChapter CX (see p . 170) the scribe Ani is seen being\r\nintroduced to the gods of Sekhet-hetep by Thoth,\r\nwho accompanies him to smooth his way and to do\r\nfor him all that he did for Osiris . Next we see him\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEA VEN.\r\n\r\nCXIII\r\nsailing in a boat laden with offerings which he is\r\nbearing to the hawk-god . Lower down we see him\r\nreaping wheat and driving the oxen which tread out the\r\ncorn, and beyond that he is kneeling before two heaps\r\nof grain, one red and one white . In the next division\r\nhe is ploughing the land of Sekhet-Anru or SekhetAaru by the side of a stream of vast length and unknown breadth, which contains neither worm nor fish .\r\nIn the fourth division is the abode of the god Osiris,\r\nand here are the places where dwell those who are\r\nnourished upon divine food, and the spiritual bodies\r\nof the dead. In one section of this division the deceased placed the god of his city, so that even in\r\nrespect of his religious observances his life might be\r\nas perfect as it was upon earth . His wishes in the\r\nmatter of the future life are well expressed in the\r\nfollowing prayer (see p . 172) :--\"Let me be rewarded with thy fields, 0 god Hetep ; that which is\r\n\"thy wish shalt thou do, 0 lord of the winds . May\r\n\"I become a Khu therein, may I eat therein, may I\r\n\"drink therein, may I plough therein, may I reap\r\n\"therein, may I fight therein, may I make love therein,\r\n\"may my words be mighty therein, may I never be\r\n\"\"in a state of servitude therein, but may I have authority therein.\" Elsewhere in the same Chapter the\r\ndeceased addresses the gods of the various lakes and\r\nsections of the Elysian Fields, and he states that he\r\nhas bathed in the holy lake, that all uncleanness has\r\ndeparted from him, and that he has arrayed himself\r\nh\r\nCXIV\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nin the apparel of Ra ; in his new life even amusements are provided (but they are the amusements of\r\nearth), for he snares feathered fowl and sails about\r\nin his boat catching worms and serpents . A remarkable passage in the text of Unas (1 . 496 ff.) describes\r\nthe deceased king as a soul in the form of a god\r\nwho devours his fathers and mothers, and -mankind\r\ngenerally, and gods . He hunts and entraps the gods\r\nin the plains of the next world, and having tied them\r\nsecurely he slays and disembowels them . The choice\r\nportions of their bodies he boils and consumes at his\r\nmeals at dawn, eventide, and midnight ; the remainder\r\nhe burns to heat the cauldrons . He eats the hearts\r\ncarefully so that he may absorb the vital powers of\r\nthe gods, and by eating other portions also he acquires all the attributes of the god . Inasmuch as he\r\nhas eaten the bodies of the gods he becomes indeed\r\na god, and since they possessed the attribute of everlasting life and could not die again, the king becomes\r\nstraightway possessed of their attributes . Here again\r\nwe have a trace of a savage custom, namely that of\r\ncutting out a portion of some intestine of a foe and\r\neating it in order to acquire his mental and physical\r\npowers ; such a custom must have disappeared from\r\nEgypt long before the monuments known to us were\r\nmade, and it is hard to understand the retention of such\r\na notion in a text filled with sublime thoughts and ideas.\r\nIn the texts of all periods we read often that the\r\ndeceased lives with Ra, that he stands among the\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN.\r\n\r\nCXV\r\ncompany of the gods, and that he is one like unto\r\nthe divine beings who dwell with them ; but little is\r\ntold us concerning his intercourse with those whom\r\nhe has known upon earth, and if it were not for some\r\ntwo or three passages in the Theban Recension of\r\nthe Book of the Dead we should be obliged to assume that the power to recognize the friends of earth\r\nin the next world was not enjoyed by the deceased .\r\nBut that he really possessed this power, at least so\r\nfar as his parents were concerned, we learn from the\r\nCXth Chapter, where the deceased, addressing a pool\r\nor lake situated in the first section of the Elysian\r\nFields, says (see p . 175), \"0 Qenqentet, I have en-\r\n\"tered into thee, and I have seen the Osiris [my\r\n\"father], and I have identified my mother,\" a delight,\r\nhowever, which he brackets with the pleasures of making love and of catching worms and serpents! In the\r\npapyrus of the priestess Anhai (Brit . Mus . No. ro ;472)\r\nwe actually see the deceased lady in converse with\r\ntwo figures, one of whom is probably her father and\r\nthe other certainly her mother, for above the head of\r\nthe latter are written the words \"her mother\" (i maut- s)\r\nfollowed by the name . A supplementary proof of this\r\nis afforded by a passage in the LIInd Chapter, where\r\nthe deceased says (see p . io3) :- \"The gods shall\r\n\"say unto me : `What manner of food wouldst thou\r\n\"'have given unto thee ?' [And I reply :] 'Let me eat\r\n\" `my food under the sycamore tree of my lady, the\r\n\"'goddess Hathor, and let my times be among the\r\nh*\r\nCXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n`divine beings who have alighted thereon. Let me\r\n-have the power to order my own fields in Tattu\r\n\" `and my own growing crops in Annu. Let me live\r\n\"`upon bread made of white barley, and let my ale\r\n-be [made] from red grain, and may the persons of\r\n\"`my father and my mother be given unto me as\r\n\" `guardians of my door and for the ordering of my\r\n\"'territory .'\" The same idea is also expressed in the\r\nCLXXXIXth Chapter (1 . 7) . Thus the deceased hoped\r\nto have in the next world an abundance of the material comforts which he enjoyed in this world, and to\r\nmeet again his own god, and his father and mother ;\r\nas we see him frequently accompanied by his wife in\r\nseveral Vignettes to other Chapters we may assume\r\nthat he would meet her again along with the children\r\nwhom she bore him .\r\nIt will be noticed that little is said throughout the\r\nBook of the Dead about the spiritual occupations of\r\nthe blessed dead, and we are told nothing of the\r\nchoirs of angels who hymn the Deity everlastingly in\r\nthe religious works of later Western nations . The\r\ndead who attained to everlasting life became in every\r\nrespect like the divine inhabitants of heaven, and they\r\nate the same meat, and drank the same drink, and\r\nwore the same apparel, and lived as they lived . No\r\nclassification of angels is mentioned, and grades of\r\nthem like Cherubim, and Seraphim, Thrones, Powers,\r\nDominions, etc ., such as are found in the celestial hierarchy of Semitic nations are unknown ; a celestial city\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEAVEN .\r\n\r\nCXVII\r\nconstructed on the model described in the Apocalypse\r\nis also unknown .\r\nWe have seen that the Elysian Fields much resembled\r\nthe flat, fertile lands intersected by large canals and\r\nstreams of running water such as must always have\r\nexisted, and may still be seen in certain parts of the\r\nDelta ; of the distance to be traversed by the dead before they were reached nothing whatever is said. As\r\nthe Egyptian made his future world a counterpart of\r\nthe Egypt which he knew and loved, and gave to it\r\nheavenly counterparts of all the sacred cities thereof,\r\nhe must have conceived the existence of a water way\r\nlike the Nile, with tributaries and branches, whereon\r\nhe might sail and perform his journeys . According to\r\nsome texts the abode of the dead was away beyond\r\nEgypt to the north, but according to others it might be\r\neither above or below the earth . The oldest tradition\r\nof all placed it above the earth, and the sky was the\r\nlarge flat or vaulted iron surface which formed its floor ;\r\nthis iron surface was supported upon four pillars, one\r\nat each of the cardinal points, and its edges were some\r\nheight above the earth . To reach this iron ceiling of\r\nthe earth and floor of heaven a ladder was thought to\r\nbe necessary, as we may see from the following passage in which Pepi the king says, \"Homage to thee,\r\n\"O ladder' of the god, homage to thee, 0 ladder of Set .\r\n\"Set thyself up, 0 ladder of the god, set thyself up,\r\ni . J ~\r\n4\r\nmagel (Pepi I, 1 . 192) .\r\nC XV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"0 ladder of Set, set thyself up, 0 ladder of Horus,\r\n\"whereby Osiris appeared in heaven when he wrought\r\n\"protection for Ra\tFor it is thy son Pepi, and\r\n\"this Pepi is Horus, and thou hast given birth to this\r\n\"Pepi even as thou halt given birth to the god who is\r\n\"the lord of the ladder. Thou hast given unto him the\r\n\"ladder of the god, and thou hast given unto him the\r\n\"ladder of Set, whereby this Pepi hath appeared in\r\n\"heaven, when he wrought protection for Ra .\" And\r\nin another place (1. 182) we read, \"Pepi goeth to his\r\n\"mother Nut there (i. c ., in heaven), and he entereth\r\n\"therein in his name of `Ladder' .\" Elsewhere we are\r\ntold that (1 . 16q) :- \"Pepi is holy . He hath received\r\n\"his staff, he is provided with his throne, and he hath\r\n\"taken his seat in the boat of the double company of\r\n\"the gods. Ra acteth as his pilot in his journey to\r\n\"the West, and he stablisheth his throne for him at\r\n\"the head of the lords of Kas, and he hath inscribed\r\n\"[his name] at the head of the living . The Peh-ka\r\n\"which is in the waters openeth its doors to this Pepi,\r\n\"and the iron [which formeth] the ceiling of the heavens\r\n\"unbolteth its gates to this Pepi ; Pepi passeth through\r\n\"them having his panther skin upon him, and his whip\r\n\"in his hand .\"\r\nA later belief placed the abode of the departed away\r\nto the west or north-west of Egypt, and the souls of\r\nthe dead made their way thither through a gap in the\r\nmountains on the western bank of the Nile near Abydos. A still later belief made out that the abode of the\r\nTHE ELYSIAN FIELDS OR HEA VEN.\r\n\r\nCXIX\r\ndeparted was a long, mountainous, narrow valley with\r\na river running along it ; starting from the east it made\r\nits way to the north, and then taking a circular direction it came back to the east . In this valley there lived\r\nall manner of fearful monsters and beasts, and here\r\nwas the country through which the sun passed during\r\nthe twelve hours of night .' It is impossible to reconcile all the conflicting statements concerning the abode\r\nof the dead, and the Egyptians themselves held different views about it at different periods . The following\r\nextracts, however, from the Pyramid Texts 2 will shew\r\nthe reader what views were held by them concerning\r\nthe home of the blessed dead in the next world, and\r\nconcerning their treatment therein by the gods .\r\n(L. 468) \"Behold Unas, cometh, behold, Unas cometh,\r\n\"behold, Unas cometh forth! And if Unas cometh not of\r\n\"his own accord thy message having come to him shall\r\n\"bring him . Unas maketh his way to his abode, and\r\n\"the cow-goddess of the Great Lake boweth down be-\r\n\"fore him ; none shall ever take away his food from\r\n\"the Great Boat, and he shall not be repulsed at the\r\n\"White House of the great ones by the region Mes-\r\n\"khent on the border of the sky .

The formulae consisted of the repetition of\r\nthe names of gods and supernatural beings, benevolent or hostile to man as the case might be, and\r\nof entreaties or curses ; the ceremonies were of various\r\nkinds, and the object of the present chapter is to describe briefly those which relate to the various sections of the Book of the Dead .\r\nThe Egyptian believed that every word spoken\r\nunder certain circumstances must be followed by some\r\neffect, good or bad ; a prayer uttered by a properly\r\nqualified person, or by a man ceremonially pure, in\r\nthe proper place, and in the proper manner, must\r\nnecessarily be answered favourably ; and similarly\r\nthe curses which were pronounced upon a man, or\r\nbeast, or thing, in the name of a hostile supernatural\r\ni*\r\nCXLV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION . being were bound to result in harm to the object\r\ncursed . It seems that this idea had its origin in the\r\nbelief that the world and all that therein is came\r\ninto being immediately after Thoth had interpreted in\r\nwords the will of the deity, in respect of the creation\r\nof the world, and that creation was the result of the\r\ngod's command . In very early times the Egyptian\r\ncalled in the professional religious man to utter words\r\nof good omen over the dead body of his relative or\r\nfriend, and later the same words written upon some\r\nsubstance and buried with him were believed to be\r\neffectual in procuring for him the good things of the\r\nlife beyond the grave . In the text on the pyramid\r\nof Unas (1. 583) is a reference to something written\r\nwhich the deceased was supposed to possess, in the\r\nfollowing words :- \"The bone and flesh which have\r\n\"no writing' are wretched, but, behold, the writing\r\n\"of Unas is under the great seal, and behold, it is\r\n\"not under the little seal .\" And in the text on the\r\npyramid of Pepi I we find the words, \"The uraeus of\r\n\"this Pepi is upon his head, there is a writing on\r\n\"each side of him, and he hath words of magical\r\n\"power at his two feet\" ; thus equipped the king enters\r\nheaven .\r\nIn the reign of Cheops, however, we are told 2 that\r\nhis second son Herutataf brought to the court a man\r\nr . \u00AE o sesh.\r\nz .

CXLIX\r\nwho possessed magical powers, and who was able to\r\njoin the head to a decapitated body and to make the\r\ncomplete body live again as before . When Cheops\r\nordered the head to be struck off from a prisoner that\r\nthe sage might fasten it on again, the sage excused\r\nhimself from performing this difficult task ; but when a\r\ngoose was brought, and its head was cut off and laid\r\non one side of the room and the body on the other,\r\nhe spake certain magical words, whereupon the goose\r\nstood up and begun to waddle, and the head began\r\nto move towards it . When the head had joined itself\r\nagain to the body the bird stood up and cackled. Thus,\r\nin that remote period a man claimed to be able to restore life to decapitated creatures by means of words\r\nof magical power, and it seems that the belief in the\r\nefficacy of the words of Thoth was already well established ; in the late period the mourner consoled himself by asserting that the Book of the Dead prepared\r\nfor his dead relative or friend had been written by\r\nthe fingers of the god Thoth himself.\r\nA common way to effect certain results, good or\r\nevil, was to employ figures made of various substances, chiefly wax, or amulets made of precious\r\nstones and metals in various forms ; both figures and\r\namulets were inscribed with words which gave them\r\nthe power to carry out the work assigned to them\r\nby those who caused them to be made . It is well\r\nknown that the Egyptians believed that the qualities\r\nand much else, including the ka, of a living original\r\nC L\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ncould be transferred to an image thereof by means of\r\nthe repetition over it of certain formulae, and a good\r\nor evil act done to a statue or figure resulted in good\r\nor evil to the person whom it represented .\r\nIn the Westcar Papyrus we are also told that the\r\nwife of a high Egyptian official called Aba-aner fell\r\nin love with one of the king's followers, and that she\r\nsent to him and told him of her desire ; subsequently\r\nthe pair met in the woman's garden, and they passed\r\nthe day in drinking and in pleasure . On the morrow\r\nthe husband was told of his wife's conduct, and he\r\ndetermined to punish both with death. Having sent for\r\nhis ebony box bound with fine metal, he made a waxen\r\ncrocodile a few inches long, and having recited magical formulae over it he gave it to his chief servant,\r\nand told him to throw it into the water when he saw\r\nhis wife's paramour going to bathe in the evening .\r\nWhen the guilty pair had passed another day together and the young man went down to the river\r\nin the evening, the chief servant cast the waxen crocodile into the water ; and as it was falling it turned\r\ninto a huge living crocodile about twelve feet long,\r\nwhich swallowed the young man . Seven days later\r\nAba - aner and the king Neb - ka went to the water\r\nwhere the crocodile was, and Aba-aner ordered it to\r\ngive up the young man ; and it came out of the water\r\nand straightway brought up the young man . When\r\nthe king had made some remark, Aba-aner picked up\r\nthe crocodile, which at once turned into the small\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLI\r\nwaxen crocodile that it was originally, and when\r\nhe again ordered it to devour the young man, it\r\nonce more became a living reptile, and, seizing the\r\nyoung man, made its way to the water, and disappeared with him . The faithless wife was burnt. The\r\nprincipal actors in this story are said to have flourished during the rule of the third dynasty of Egypt,\r\nnearly four thousand years before Christ, and it is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that the narrative mentions the ebony\r\nand metal box and the making of a waxen crocodile\r\nin a way which seems to shew that their owner was\r\nin the habit of using the box and the wax frequently.'\r\nAbout the time of the eighteenth dynasty, we learn\r\nfrom a papyrus 2 that a man was prosecuted in Egypt\r\nfor having made figures of men and women in wax,\r\nby which he caused sundry and divers pains and\r\nsicknesses to the living beings whom they represented. And, according to Pseudo-Callisthenes, j Nectanebus wrought magic by means of a bowl of water,\r\nsome waxen figures, and an ebony rod . The waxen\r\nfigures were made in the forms of the soldiers of the\r\nenemy who were coming against him by sea or by\r\nland, and were placed upon the water in the basin\r\nby him. Nectanebus then arrayed himself in suitable\r\napparel, and, having taken the rod in his hand, bei . I have reproduced this paragraph from my Lafe and Exploits of\r\nAlexander the Great, p . XIII .\r\nz . Chabas, Le Papyrus Magique Harris, p . 170 ff.\r\n3 . Ed . Miiller, lib . i . cap . ff.\r\nC LI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\ngan to recite certain formulae and the names of divine powers known unto him, whereupon the waxen\r\nfigures became animated, and straightway sank to the\r\nbottom of the bowl ; at the same moment the hosts of\r\nthe enemy were destroyed . If the foe was coming by\r\nsea he placed the waxen soldiers in waxen ships, and\r\nat the sound of the words of power both ships and\r\nmen sank into the waves as the waxen models sank\r\nto the bottom of the sea . The same informant tells us\r\nthat when Nectanebus wished Olympias, the mother\r\nof Alexander the Great, to believe that the god Ammon had visited her during the night, he went forth\r\nfrom her presence into the plain and gathered a number\r\nof herbs which had the power of causing dreams, and\r\npressed out the juice from them. He then fashioned\r\na female figure in the form of Olympias, and inscribed\r\nthe Queen's name upon it, and having made the model\r\nof a bed he laid the figure thereon . Nectanebus next\r\nlit a lamp, and, reciting the words of power which\r\nwould compel the demons to send Olympias a dream,\r\nhe poured out the juice of the herbs over the waxen\r\nfigure ; and at the moment of the performance of\r\nthese acts Olympias dreamed that she was in the\r\narms of the god Ammon .\r\nA tradition also exists to the effect that Aristotle\r\ngave to Alexander the Great a number of waxen\r\nfigures nailed down in a box which was fastened by\r\na chain, and which he ordered him never to let go\r\nout of his own hand, or at least out of that of one\r\nTHE .IIAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLIII\r\nof his confidential servants . The box was to go wherever Alexander went, and Aristotle taught him to recite certain formulae over it whenever he took it up\r\nor put it down . The figures in the box were intended\r\nto represent the various kinds of armed forces that\r\nAlexander was likely to find opposed to him . Some\r\nof the models held in their hands leaden swords which\r\nwere curved backwards, and some had spears in their\r\nhands pointed head downwards, and some had bows\r\nwith cut strings ; all these were laid face downwards\r\nin the box . When Alexander was engaged in war with\r\nany nation armed with swords, or spears, or bows, if\r\nhe recited the formulae which Aristotle had taught\r\nhim, the swords of the foe would become as lead\r\nand bend backwards, the spears would become impotent in the hands of those who held them and their\r\nheads would turn to the ground, and the strings of\r\nthe bows would snap.\r\nReturning to purely Egyptian sources for information concerning the use of wax figures we come to\r\nan important work,' consisting of several Chapters\r\nwhich were to be recited to keep away storm-clouds\r\nand thunder from the sky . One Chapter reads : \"Fire\r\n\"upon thee, 0 Apep, thou enemy of Ra ! The Eye of\r\n\"Horus prevaileth over the accursed soul and shade\r\n\"of Apep, the flame of the Eye of Horus gnaweth into\r\n\"that enemy of Rd, the flame of the Eye of Horus\r\n\"eateth into all the enemies of P-aa in death and in\r\ni . For the text and translation of it see Archaeoloa ia, Vol . 52 .\r\nC LI V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\"life .\" The Rubric belonging to the Chapters orders\r\nthat it shall be \"recited over Apep written in green\r\n\"ink upon a piece of new papyrus, and over a wax\r\n\"figure of Apep on which his name is inscribed in\r\n\"green ink ; this figure shall then be put in the fire\r\n\"that the enemy of Rd may be devoured . When Apep\r\n\"is put in the fire speak ye words of power and say,\r\n\"`Taste thou,' death to thee, Apep . Get thee back, re-\r\n\"treat, thou enemy of Rd, fall down, wriggle away,\r\n\"depart, retreat . I have driven thee back, I have\r\n\"hacked thee in pieces ; . . . . Back, thou fiend, an\r\n\"end to thee ! Therefore have I cast fire at thee,\r\n\"therefore have I caused thee to be destroyed, there-\r\n\"fore have I judged and condemned thee to an evil\r\n\"doom .

Thou shalt do the\r\n\"like of this many times as a preventive against the\r\n\"shower, the sun's disk shall shine, and Apep shall be\r\n\"overthrown in very truth .\" Elsewhere we are told\r\nthat if it be wished to destroy the fiends which accompany Apep we must \"write the names of their\r\n\"fathers, and mothers, and offspring with green paint\r\n\"upon new papyrus, and also inscribe their names\r\n\"upon wax figures of them which shall be tied round\r\n\"with dark hair . These figures shall be spit upon, and\r\n\"shall be spurned with the left foot and stabbed with\r\n\"a stone knife .\"\r\nThe most important mention of figures in the Book\r\nof the Dead occurs in the Vlth Chapter which, properly speaking, forms one of the texts that accompany the scene of the Funeral Chamber as exhibited\r\nin Chapter CLI. When the Egyptian, in very early\r\ndays, conceived the existence of the Ely sian Fields\r\nit occurred to him that the agricultural labours which\r\nwould have to be carried out there might entail upon\r\nhimself toil and fatigue . To avoid this a short Chapter\r\n(V) was drawn up, the recital of which was believed to\r\nfree the deceased from doing any work in the underworld. But it was felt that the work must be done\r\nby some person or thing, and eventually it became\r\nthe custom to bury a figure or figures of the de-\r\nC LV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nceased with him in his tomb so that it or they might\r\nperform whatever work fell to his share . It is probable that in semi-savage times the wealthy Egyptian's burial was accompanied by the slaughter of\r\nseveral slaves, who were supposed to follow him to\r\nthe next, world and to minister to his wants there ;\r\nthe figures which were buried with the dead in the\r\nlater times seem to have taken the place of the\r\nslaughtered slaves. To these figures the Egyptian\r\ngave the name ushabfiu, a word which is commonly\r\nrendered by \"respondents\" or \"answerers\", and they\r\nare often described in modern times as the \"working\r\nfigures of Hades\" . They are made of stone of various\r\nkinds, wood, faience, etc . ; I know of none earlier than\r\nthe XIth dynasty . They are inscribed with a text in\r\nwhich the deceased says, \"If I be called, or if I be\r\n\"adjudged to do any work whatsoever of the labours\r\n\"which are to be done in the underworld by a man\r\n\"in his turn, let the judgment fall upon thee instead\r\n\"of upon me always, in the matter of sowing the\r\n\"fields, of filling the water-courses with water, and\r\n\"of bringing the sands of the east to the west .\" To\r\nthis the shabfi figure makes reply, \"Verily I am here,\r\n\"[and will come whithersoever thou biddest me .\"\r\nSeveral of the Chapters of the Book of the Dead\r\nare followed by Rubrics_ which give directions for the\r\nperformance of certain magical ceremonies, and among\r\nthem may be specially mentioned the following :-\r\nChap . XIII . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD . CLVII\r\ntwo rings made of dnkham flowers ; one was to be\r\nlaid on the right ear of the deceased, and the other\r\nwas to be wrapped up in a piece of byssus whereon\r\nthe name of the deceased was inscribed .\r\nChap .

This Chapter was to be recited over a\r\npicture of the boat of the Sun painted with a special\r\nink upon a piece of new papyrus, which was to be\r\nlaid on the breast of the deceased, who would then\r\nhave power to embark in the boat of Rd and to\r\njourney with the god .\r\nChap. CXXV. The Judgment Scene was to be painted upon a tile made of earth upon which neither the\r\npig nor any other animal had trodden ; and if the\r\ntext of the Chapter was also written upon it, the deceased and his children would flourish for ever, his\r\nname would never be forgotten, and his place would\r\nhenceforth be with the followers of Osiris.\r\nChap . CXXX . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\na picture of the god Rd wherein a figure of the deceased sitting in the bows was drawn ; this done the\r\nsoul of the deceased would live for ever .\r\nChap.

A model of the starry\r\nC LV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nheavens was also to be made and upon it the model\r\nof the boat of Rd was to be moved about, in imitation\r\nof the motion of the boat of the god in heaven ; this\r\nceremony would cause the deceased to be received\r\nby the gods in heaven as one of themselves .\r\nChap. CXXXIV. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover figures of a hawk (Rd), Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Seb,\r\nNut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys painted on a\r\nplaque which was to be placed in a model of the\r\nboat of Ra wherein the deceased was seated ; this\r\nceremony would cause the deceased to travel with\r\nRd in the sky .\r\nChap. CXXXVI A. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover a figure of the deceased seated in the boat of Ra . Chap . CXXXVII A. This Chapter was to be recited\r\nover four fires, fed by a special kind of cloth anointed with unguent, which were to be placed in the hands\r\nof four men who had the names of the pillars of Horus written upon their shoulders . Four clay troughs,\r\nwhereon incense had been sprinkled, were to be filled\r\nwith the milk of a white cow, and the milk was to\r\nbe employed in extinguishing the four fires . If this\r\nChapter were recited daily (?) for the deceased he\r\nwould become like unto Osiris in every respect . The\r\nRubric supplies a series of texts which were to be\r\nrecited :(i) over a Tet of crystal set in a plinth,\r\nwhich was to be placed in the west wall of the tomb ;\r\n(2) over a figure of Anubis set in a plinth, which was\r\nto be placed in the east wall ; (3) over a brick smeared\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE ROOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLIX\r\nwith pitch which was set on fire, and then placed in\r\nthe south wall ; and (q) over a brick inscribed with\r\nthe figure of a palm tree, which was set in the north\r\nwall .\r\nChap. CXL . This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nan utchat, or figure of the Eye of Horns, made either\r\nof lapis-lazuli or Mak stone, and over another made\r\nof jasper . During the recital of the Chapter four altars were to be lighted for Ra-Tem, and four for the\r\nUtchat, and four for the gods who were mentioned\r\ntherein.\r\nChap . CXLIV. The seven sections of this Chapter\r\nwere to be recited over a drawing of the Seven\r\nArits, at each of which three gods were seated ; by\r\nthese means the deceased was prevented from being\r\nturned back at the door of any one of the seven\r\nmansions of Osiris .\r\nChap . CLXII. This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nthe figure of a cow made of fine gold which was to\r\nbe placed at the neck of the deceased ; during the\r\nperformance of this ceremony the priest is ordered\r\nto say, \"O Amen, 0 Amen, who art in ' heaven, turn\r\n\"thy face upon the dead body of thy son and make\r\n\"him sound and strong in the underworld .\"\r\nChap.

CLXV. This Chapter was to be recited over\r\nthe figure of the \"god of the lifted hand\", who had\r\na body in the form of that of a beetle .\r\nBesides these a number of Chapters have Rubrics,\r\nvarying in length from two to twenty lines, which\r\ndeclare that if the deceased be acquainted with their\r\ncontents or if they be inscribed upon his coffin, they\r\nwill enable him to attain great happiness and freedom in the world beyond the grave . Seven other\r\nChapters consist of texts which were written upon\r\nthe amulets that were usually laid upon the mummy,\r\nnamely Nos . XXX B, LXXXIX, CLV, CLVI, CLVII,\r\nCLVIII, and CLIX . Chapter XXX B is found inscribed\r\nupon thousands of large green basalt scarabs, which\r\nwere usually set in a banded frame of gold and laid\r\ninside or upon the breast, just over the heart ; it is\r\nalso found inscribed upon green basalt amulets made\r\nin the form of the heart .' The object of this amulet\r\nwas to preserve the heart of the deceased and to protect it from the attacks of those who were thought to\r\nsteal away the hearts of the dead ; its use is as old\r\nas the IV th dynasty, in which period the text was\r\nnot cut but painted upon it . Chapter LXXXIX, which\r\nwas written to ensure the union of the soul with the\r\ni . I have described the chief examples of this amulet in my Papyrus\r\nof Am', p . z6z .\r\nTHE MAGIC OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\n\r\nCLXI\r\nbody in the underworld, was recited over the humanheaded hawk made of gold and inlaid with precious\r\nstones which was laid upon the neck of the mummy ;\r\nexamples of this amulet have been found with a few\r\nwords of the Chapter inscribed upon them . Chapter\r\nCLV is found inscribed upon Tets made of gold and\r\nprecious stones which have been found attached to\r\nthe neck of the mummy ; this amulet represents the\r\ntree-trunk, with four branches pointing to the four\r\ncardinal points, which contained the dead body of\r\nOsiris, and it bestowed upon its possessor stability\r\nand lasting preservation . Chapter CLVI is found inscribed upon several carnelian \"buckles\" which have\r\nbeen found attached to the neck of the mummy ; this\r\namulet gave to the deceased the powers which were\r\nenshrined in the blood and power and enchantments\r\nof the goddess Isis . Chapter CLVII is found inscribed\r\nupon gold vultures which have been found attached\r\nto the neck of the mummy ; this amulet gave the\r\ndeceased the protection of the goddess Isis such as\r\nshe exercised on behalf of her own son Horus . Chapter CLVIII was inscribed upon the collar of gold which\r\nwas placed on the neck of the mummy ; this amulet\r\ngave the deceased freedom from the bandages with\r\nwhich he was swathed. Chapter CL IX is found inscribed upon several mother-of-emerald sceptres which\r\nwere attached to the neck of the mummy ; this amulet gave \"protection\" or \"strength\" to the deceased .\r\nChapter CLXII is found inscribed upon circular pieces\r\nk\r\nC LXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nof papyri laid down upon cartonnazie backs, commonly\r\nknown as \"hypocephali\" ; they were placed under the\r\nback of the head of the mummy and by this warmth,\r\nsimilar to that which he possessed upon earth, was\r\nimparted . Chapter CLXVI is found inscribed upon\r\nsmall pillows made of haematite and other substances ; as the ordinary pillow raised the head of the\r\nmummy from the bed of the coffin, so this amulet\r\nraised the head of the deceased in the horizon and\r\nprevented it from being laid low . Finally, figures of\r\nthe gods in metal, stone, faience, wood, wax, etc.,\r\nwere attached to the mummy in order to place it\r\nunder the special protection of the deities whom they\r\nrepresented.

CLXV\r\nFinally, mention must be made here of the great\r\nimportance attached by the Egyptians to the knowledge of the names of gods, supernatural beings, etc .,\r\nand it seems that the deceased who was ignorant of\r\nthem must have fared badly in the underworld . Thus\r\nin Chapter I B (see p . 24) it is said that the deceased\r\nknoweth Osiris and his names ; in Chapter XCIX (see\r\np . 158) the deceased is obliged to tell the names of\r\nevery portion of the boat wherein he wishes to cross\r\nthe great river in the underworld ; in Chapter CXXV\r\n(p . 19o) Anubis makes him declare the names of the\r\ntwo leaves of the door of the Hall of Osiris before he\r\nwill let him in, and even the bolts, and bolt-sockets,\r\nand lintels, and planks will not allow him to enter\r\nuntil the deceased has satisfied them that he knows\r\ntheir names . Entrance into the seven Arits or mansions (see p . 240) could not be obtained without a\r\nknowledge of the names of the doorkeeper, watcher,\r\nand herald who belonged to each ; and similarly, the\r\npylons of the domains of Osiris (see p . 243 f .) could\r\nnot be passed through by the deceased without a\r\ndeclaration by him of the name of each. The idea\r\nunderlying all such statements is that the man who\r\nknows the name of a god could invoke and obtain help\r\nfrom him by calling upon him, and that the hostility\r\nof a fiend could be successfully opposed by the repetition of his name . The knowledge of the names\r\nof fiends and demons constituted the chief power of\r\nthe magicians of olden times, and the amulets of\r\nC LXV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe Gnostics which were inscribed with numbers of\r\nnames of supernatural powers are the practical expression of the belief in the efficacy of the knowledge of names which existed in Egypt from time\r\nimmemorial.\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS OF THE\r\nBOOK OF THE DEAD .\r\nThough the Chapters of the Book of the Dead represent beliefs belonging to various periods of the\r\nlong life of the Egyptian nation, and opinions held\r\nby several schools of thought in Egypt, the object\r\nof them all was to benefit the deceased . They were\r\nintended to give him the power to have and to enjoy life everlasting, to give him everything which he\r\nrequired in the life beyond the grave, to ensure -his\r\nvictory over his foes, to procure for him the power of\r\ngoing whithersoever he pleased and when and how he\r\npleased, to preserve the mummy intact, and finally to\r\nenable his soul to enter into the bark of Ra or into\r\nwhatever abode of the blessed had been conceived of\r\nby him. A perusal of the translations of the Chapters\r\nwill shew the reader what their contents are, but it\r\nwill not be out of place here to group certain Chapters which have a common object, for the various beliefs which they represent then become more clear .\r\nA certain number of the Chapters of the Book of\r\nthe Dead are hymns which are addressed either to\r\nC LXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nRd or to Osiris. In the present work these are represented by the hymns from the papyri of Ani, Qenna,\r\nHu-nefer, and Nekht (see pp . 3-I2), which I have\r\ncalled \"Hymns Introductory\", and to these we should\r\nadd Chapters CLXXXII and CLXXXIII, which are really hymns to Osiris by Thoth . Another collection of\r\nfine hymns is found in Chapter XV, where we have\r\nhymns to Rd and Osiris, and a Litany to Osiris ; the\r\nPapyrus of Ani, from which these are translated, gives\r\nthe oldest and most complete form of the Chapter .\r\nThey are most important, for they enable us to understand what attributes were ascribed to Ra, and it\r\nseems as if many of them were, in later times, transferred to Osiris, who was originally nothing but a god\r\nof the dead .\r\nWith these hymns should be mentioned the texts\r\nwhich accompany the judgment Scene, but these have\r\nalready been described in the chapter on that subject\r\ngiven above, and they are fully translated on pp . 12\r\n-15 . The Judgment Scene also leads us to the consideration of the CXXVth Chapter, which is certainly\r\none of the most important and interesting in the whole\r\nbook. It consists of three parts :-- Introduction, Negative Confession, and Concluding Text . The Introduction was said by the deceased at the entrance to\r\nthe Hall of double Maati, the Negative Confession\r\nwas recited by him before the forty-two gods who\r\nsat in judgment upon him in this Hall, and the Concluding Text was uttered by him when he had passed\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXIX\r\nthe ordeal of judgment and was beginning his new\r\nlife . It is probable that these three texts were originally merely versions each of the other, but in the\r\neighteenth dynasty they are all copied together into\r\npapyri. The deceased first asserted that he had not\r\ncommitted certain sins ; he next addressed forty-two\r\ngods by their names and declared before each that\r\nhe had not committed the special sin which it was\r\nthe duty of the god to punish ; and lastly he makes\r\na third confession, the first part of which is practically\r\nin the same words as a portion of the Introduction .\r\nThe Introduction provided the passwords which enabled him to enter the Hall, and the Concluding Text\r\nprovided those which enabled him to go forth from\r\nit . It is impossible to say when or how this beautiful\r\nChapter with its lofty conceptions of morality grew,\r\nbut, although the form in which these are set forth\r\nis not older than the eighteenth dynasty, the ideas\r\nthemselves belong to a period which is as old as\r\nthe rule of the kings of the third dynasty . From the\r\nNegative Confession we see that the pious Egyptian\r\nabhorred fraud, theft, deceit, robbery with violence,\r\niniquity of every kind, adultery, unchastity and sins\r\nof wantonness, manslaughter, murder, incitement to\r\nmurder, and that he delighted in shewing he had\r\nwronged none in any way . He neither purloined the\r\nthings which belonged to his god, nor did he slay\r\nthe sacred animals ; he thought not lightly of the god\r\nof his city, and he never cursed him . He honoured\r\nC LXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nhis king, and he neither wasted his neighbour's ploughed lands nor defiled his running stream . He spake not\r\nhaughtily, he behaved not insolently, he multiplied not\r\nhis speech overmuch, he abused no man, he attacked\r\nno man, he swore not at all, he stirred not up strife, he\r\nterrified no man, he was not a man of wrath, he spake\r\nevil of none, and he never pried into matters to make\r\nmischief. He judged not hastily, he defrauded not his\r\nneighbour in the market, he shut not his ears to the\r\nwords of right and truth, he sought not honours, he\r\nnever gave way to anger except for a proper cause,\r\nand he sought not to enrich himself at the expense\r\nof his neighbours. It is difficult to give the exact\r\nshades of meaning of many of the words in this Confession, but the general sense is thoroughly well made\r\nout ; the Egyptian code of morals, as may be seen\r\nfrom the CXXVth Chapter, was the grandest and most\r\ncomprehensive of those now known to have existed\r\namong the nations of antiquity .\r\nThe CXth Chapter, which describes the employments\r\nand enjoyments of the deceased in the Sekhet-hetep\r\nand Sekhet-Aaru, or Elysian Fields, contains ideas of\r\nthe greatest antiquity, which date, probably, from the\r\ntime when the system of village communities was in\r\nvogue in Egypt. The deceased ploughs, sows, and\r\nreaps, and lives exactly the same kind of life as a\r\nfarmer would live in the fertile lands of the Delta,\r\nand it would seem that he enjoys all the pleasures\r\nwhich a human being enjoys upon earth . In the Vth\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC .\r\n\r\nCLXXI\r\nChapter of the Book of the Dead the deceased found\r\na text which would free him from certain agricultural\r\nlabours which had to be done in the Elysian fields,\r\nbut inasmuch as the work of watering and top-dressing the fields and sowing the crops had to be done\r\nby some one, figures, made in the form of the deceased and inscribed with his name, were buried with\r\nthe dead to toil for him . Such figures have often in\r\ntheir hands models of the basket in which the field\r\nlabourer carried earth and the hoe with which he\r\nfilled it ; and the text of the VI th Chapter, which\r\nwas also inscribed upon them, provided the deceased\r\nwith substitutes to toil for him in the farms of the\r\ngods .\r\nThe reader will seek, and seek in . vain, for many\r\nof the attributes of the prayers of Christian nations,\r\nand it is a noticeable fact that the Egyptian had no\r\nconception of repentance ; at the judgment which took\r\nplace in the Hall of Osiris he based his claim for admission into the kingdom of that god upon the fact\r\nthat he had not committed certain sins, and that he\r\nhad feared God and honoured the king, and had given\r\nbread to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to\r\nthe naked, and a boat to him that had suffered shipwreck on the Nile . His belief in the efficacy of works\r\nwas great, and, when he had any doubt about their\r\npower to deliver him finally from the hosts of darkness, he protected himself by means of amulets, inscribed or plain, and figures of gods painted upon\r\nC LXXI I\r\n\r\nINTR OD UCTION.\r\nhis coffin and papyrus, or cut in wood or on stones\r\nwhich possessed magical powers . The Chapters which\r\nrefer to such amulets are Nos . XIII, XIX, XXX B,\r\nLXXXIX, C, CXXV, CXXX, CXXXIII, CXXXIV,\r\nCXXXVIA, CXXXVIIA, CXL, CXLIV, CLVI, CLVII,\r\nCLVIII, CLIX, CLXII, CLXIII, CLXIV, CLXV, and\r\nCLXVI.\r\nOne of the most interesting Chapters in the whole\r\nbook is the XVII th, which contains a series of statements concerning the origin of the gods and the things\r\nof the next world . To many of these statements more\r\nthan one explanation of their meaning is appended, and\r\nas these occur in copies of the Chapter which are\r\nfound inscribed upon coffins of the eleventh dynasty,\r\nit is clear that already at that early date several\r\nopinions on these matters existed . The views expressed in the Chapter appear to be those of the ancient College of Priests at Heliopolis which became\r\ngradually adopted throughout Egypt . The Vignettes\r\nwhich accompany the Chapter in the best illuminated\r\npapyri are most elaborate, and they shew by their\r\nattention to detail that it formed one of the most\r\nimportant of the texts of this class which were copied for general use .\r\nThe LXIVth Chapter was very highly esteemed,\r\nand it was believed to be one of the oldest parts of\r\nthe Book of the Dead. Already in the eleventh dynasty it existed in two versions, one of which was\r\nthought to have been composed or edited in the first\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXIII\r\ndynasty, and the other in the fourth dynasty . The\r\nlonger version is entitled simply \"The Chapter of\r\nComing Forth by Day in the underworld\", but the\r\nshorter is described as \"The Chapter of knowing the\r\n`Chapters of Coming Forth by Day' in a single Chapter\" . Whether we are to understand by the latter title\r\nthat the Chapter contained the essence of all the\r\nChapters of the Book of the Dead and that the deceased who was provided with it was as well protected as if he had copies of them all, is not quite\r\nclear, but it seems probable . It will be noticed that\r\nseveral Chapters are called \"Chapters of Coming\r\nForth by Day\", and among them may be specially\r\nnoticed :- Chapters II and III, which provide that the\r\ndeceased may come forth in the underworld and \"live\r\nafter he hath died, even as doth Ra day by day\" ;\r\nChapter LXV, which provides that the Khu of the\r\ndeceased shall live and shall inflict blows upon his\r\nenemy ; Chapter LXVI, which gives the deceased\r\npower to \"alight upon the forehead of Ra\" ; Chapter\r\nLXVIII, which gives him mastery over everything\r\nwhich is in the underworld, and enables him to journey about among the living ; Chapters LXIX, LXX,\r\nand LXXI, wherein he identifies himself with Osiris,\r\nSah (Orion), Anubis, Horus, and Tem, and declares\r\nhis power over the winds of heaven ; Chapter LXXII,\r\nwhich enables him to \"come forth by day in all the\r\nforms which he pleaseth to take\" and to enter into\r\nan abode in the Elysian Fields, where he shall be\r\nC LXXI V\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. amply provided with wheat and barley ; and Chapter\r\nCLXXX, which enables him to go about in the underworld with freedom of movement and to perform all\r\nthe transformations of a \"living soul\" .\r\nAn important group of Chapters referring to the\r\ntransformations which a man may undergo, if he\r\npleases, in the underworld, is introduced by Chapter\r\nLXXVI, wherein the deceased declares that he has\r\nbeen led unto the \"House of the King\" by the mantes, or so-called \"praying insect\" . These Chapters enable him to transform himself into a hawk of gold\r\n(Chap. LXXVII), into a divine hawk (Chap . LXXVIII),\r\ninto the Governor of the divine sovereign princes\r\n(Chap . LXXIX), into the god who giveth light in the\r\ndarkness (Chap . LXXX), into a lotus (Chaps . LXXXI A\r\nand LXXXI B), into the god Ptah and into a living\r\nbeing in Annu (Chap . LXXXII), into a Bennu (phoenix?) (Chap . LXXXIII), into a heron (Chap . LXXXIV),\r\ninto a living soul (Chap . LXXXV), into a swallow (Chap .\r\nLXXXVI), into the serpent Sata (Chap . LXXXVII), and\r\ninto a crocodile (Chap . LXXXVIII).\r\nA considerable number of Chapters refer, as we\r\nshould naturally expect, to the preservation of the\r\nbody of the deceased in the tomb, and several were\r\nexpressly written to give him power to resist the attacks of enemies, and to obtain meat, and drink, and\r\nthe power of motion in the underworld. Thus Chapter I, which is proved by its title and Vignette to\r\nrefer to the ceremonies which took place on the day\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXV\r\nof the funeral, provides for the burial of the body in\r\nthe proper way so that \"the deceased may go in after\r\ncoming forth\" ; and Chapters VIII, IX, XI, XII, XIII,\r\nXLVIII, LXVII, CVII, CXVIII, CXIX, CXXII, CLXI,\r\nand CLXXX enable him to make his way in the way\r\nunderworld without let or hindrance and to overcome\r\nhis enemies . The deceased wished to protect himself\r\nby means of magical formulae ; Chapter XXIV provides\r\nthese formulae for him, and Chapter XXXII gives him\r\nthe power to keep hold of them . Chapters XXI and\r\nXXII give the deceased a mouth, and Chapter XXIII\r\nprovides him with the power of opening it ; Chapter\r\nXXV gave him the faculty of remembering his\r\nname. Seven Chapters (XXVI-XXX B) gave him a\r\nheart, and provided him with prayers and formulae,\r\nwhich prevented those who stole hearts from snatching it away from him and from driving it away from\r\nhim when it was weighed in the judgment Hall of\r\nOsiris . The crocodile, which came to steal away the\r\nwords of power and protection which the deceased\r\nhad with him, was repulsed by the words of Chapter\r\nXXXI. Chapters XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI,\r\nXXXVII, and XXXIX prevented him from being stung\r\nor bitten by snakes and serpents, and did away with\r\nthe power of the beetle (?) aj5shait to gnaw his body\r\nto pieces . Chapters XXXVIII A and XXXVIII B enabled him to escape from the deadly cobra, and\r\nChapter XL delivered him from the power of the\r\nserpent who, though he is here acting as the friend\r\nC LX XV I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nof Horus by devouring the Ass which typifies the\r\nfiend Set, is, nevertheless, to be feared . In the underworld and the cities thereof punishment was inflicted\r\non the dead, and to provide the favoured of Osiris\r\nwith power to escape from stripes, and wounds, and\r\ndecapitation at the deadly block Chapters XLI, XLII,\r\nXLIII, and L were composed . The deceased wished\r\nfor a seat in the celestial Annu (Heliopolis), and this\r\nwas given him by Chapter LXXV, and Chapter XLVII\r\nprevented his throne and his habitation from being\r\nremoved by any hostile being. He sighed to have\r\npower over running water and to snuff the sweet\r\nbreath of the north wind, and these comforts were\r\nsecured for him by Chapters LIV, LV, LVI, LVII,\r\nLVIII, LIX, LX, LXI, and LXII ; the large number\r\nof Chapters written for this purpose will shew how\r\ngreat was the anxiety of the Egyptian in this matter .\r\nAs fire and boiling water existed in the underworld\r\nhe hastened to protect himself from burns or scalds\r\nby the use of Chapters LXIII A and LXIII B . Proper\r\nfood was as necessary to the ka or double of the deceased as fresh air and water, and to ensure it against\r\nthe need to eat filth and to drink dirty water Chapters LII, LIII, CV, CX, CXLVIII and CLXXXIX were\r\ncomposed ; the idea of the ka being obliged to wander about starving and in search of food was so abhorrent to the pious Egyptian that every text which\r\ncould in any wise help to secure sufficient meat and\r\ndrink for it was gladly copied over and over again .\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXVII\r\nThe object of Chapters IV, LXXIV, CXVII, CXIX,\r\nwas to enable the deceased to walk about at will,\r\nand to roam through Re-stau, or the passages of the\r\ntomb and underworld, and when his way was stopped\r\nby Apep, Chapter VII enabled him to pass over the\r\nback of the fiend. The union of the soul with the\r\nbody was provided for by Chapter LXXXIX, as\r\nwas the escape of the soul and the shade from the\r\nbonds of the tomb by Chapters XCI and XCIL Though\r\nthe deceased had no wish to go to the east in the\r\nunderworld (see Chap . XCIII) he, nevertheless, wished to visit the celestial Abydos ; a successful journey to this city was secured by the use of Chapter CXXXVIII. In spite of the best efforts of the\r\nembalmers bodies sometimes rotted and perished\r\nin their tombs ; such calamities were averted by\r\nChapters XLV and XLVI, and especially by Chapter\r\nCLIV, which is one of the most interesting in the\r\nwhole book. Overthrow in the underworld was averted by the use of Chapter LI, the wrath of the god\r\nwas appeased by Chapter XIV, and the danger of\r\ndying a second time was done away with by Chapters XLIV, CLXXV, and CLXXVI . The love of ritual\r\nand ceremony induced the Egyptians to take special\r\ncare about the arrangement of the mummy, and coffin,\r\nand funeral furniture in the mummy chamber, and to\r\nmake certain that all was properly done in this matter,\r\nChapter CLI, which consists of a view of the chamber\r\nand a group of short but important texts, was coma\r\nC LXXV I I I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nposed. The type of this chamber was, of course, the\r\ntomb of Osiris. The Hall of Osiris wherein the god\r\ndwelt with his princes could only be reached after\r\ncertain doors, and mansions, and domains, which were\r\nguarded by porters in the form of monsters, had been\r\nsuccessfully . passed through by the deceased ; to enable the deceased to go through the seven mansions,\r\nand the twenty-one pylons, and the fifteen domains,\r\nChapters CXLIV-CXLVII, CXLIX, and CL were\r\nwritten. These provided the deceased with the names\r\nof the beings who were in charge of the doors, and\r\nsupplied him with the speeches which it was necessary that he should make . During his journey in the\r\nunderworld the deceased came to a huge river which\r\nhe was obliged to cross ; to enable him to embark in\r\nthe mystical boat, every portion of which possessed\r\na name which he was bound to know and be able to\r\nrepeat, he provided himself with Chapters XCVIII and\r\nXCIX. But this boat only served to take him across\r\nthe river, and he longed to be able to embark in the\r\nBoat of Rd, and to sit in its bows and to sail about\r\nwith the god for ever ; this delight, however, could\r\nonly be secured for him by means of Chapters C, CI,\r\nCII, CXXXIV, CXXXVIA, and CXXXVI B, and, as a\r\nresult, copies of most of these Chapters exist in nearly all large papyri . The Egyptian believed that he\r\nwould encounter the foes who attacked Osiris in the\r\nunderworld, and that the calamities which befel the\r\ngod would come upon him also ; he who delivered\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXIX\r\nOsiris out of all his troubles was Thoth, the scribe\r\nof the gods, and to him were addressed Chapters\r\nXVIII and XX, which secured for the deceased\r\nthe protection and triumph which this god had secured for \"his brother Osiris\" . The favour of Thoth\r\nwas so necessary that four Chapters (XCIV, XCV,\r\nXCVI, XCVII) were written to instruct the deceased\r\nto make an offering of a palette and an ink-jar to\r\nthe god, and how to become nigh unto him . Before\r\nthe deceased could roam at will in the underworld\r\nit was necessary that he should know the deities of\r\nthe chief cities of the four quarters of the land wherein he was ; Chapters CVII and CVIII enabled him to\r\nknow the \"souls of Amentet\", (1 . e ., of the West), Chapter CIX enabled him to know the \"souls of the East\",\r\nChapter CXII enabled him to know the \"souls of the\r\ncity of Pe\" [in the north], Chapter CXIII enabled him\r\nto know the \"souls of the city of Nekhen\" [in the\r\nsouth], Chapter CXV enabled him to know the \"souls\r\nof Annu\", and Chapters CXIV and CXVI enabled him\r\nto know the \"souls of the city of Khemennu\" (Hermopolis) . In the underworld the deceased was threatened\r\nby the danger of the snarer or fowler and his net,\r\nand Chapters CLIIIA and CLIMB were written to enable him to escape from them . Two Chapters, CLXIX\r\nand CLXX, provided for the stablishing of the funeral bed of the deceased ; two Chapters, CLXVIII A\r\nand CLXVIII B, set out at length the libations which\r\nit was necessary for him to pour out ; Chapter CXXIII\r\n1*\r\nC LXXX\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION. .\r\ngave him power to enter the \"Great House\" ; Chapters CXXVI, CXXVII, CXXVIII, CLXXXV, and\r\nCLXXXVI supplied him with the prayers which had\r\nto be said to the holy apes, and to the gods who\r\nwere the leaders and guides in the underworld, and\r\nto Osiris and Hathor ; Chapter CXXXII enabled him\r\nto go back to see his house ; Chapter CLII gave him\r\npower to build a house upon earth ; Chapter CLXXI\r\nprovided him with the girdle of purity ; Chapters CIII,\r\nCXXIV, CXXXI, and CLXXXI gave him power to\r\ngo in before the divine sovereign chiefs of Osiris and\r\nto be nigh unto Ra ; Chapter CIV gave him a seat\r\namong the \"great gods\" ; and Chapter CLXXXIV\r\nbrought him \"nigh unto Osiris\" . Chapter CXXX, which\r\n\"made perfect the Khu\", was ordered to be recited\r\non the birthday of Osiris ; Chapter CXXXIII made\r\nthe Khu perfect before the Great Company of the\r\ngods ; Chapter CXXXV, which was to be recited on\r\nthe day of the new moon, gave the deceased power\r\nto become like unto Thoth ; Chapter CXL, which was\r\nto be recited on the last day of the sixth month of\r\nth ; Egyptian year, enabled him to appear in glory\r\nbefore all the gods when the utchat, or Eye of Rd,\r\nwas full ; and Chapter CLXVII conferred upon him\r\nthe power which the utchat possessed and enabled\r\nhim to identify himself with it . Chapters CXLI and\r\nCXLII provided the texts which a man was directed\r\nto recite \"for his father or for his son during the\r\nfestival of Amentet\", they made the deceased to be\r\nTHE OBJECT AND CONTENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\nCLXXXI\r\nperfect with Rd and with the gods ; and Chapter\r\nCLXXIII contained the addresses which Horus made\r\nto his father Osiris, and which were also assumed to\r\nbe made to the deceased by Horus . Chapter CLXXII\r\nis a remarkable and beautiful composition in nine sections, the contents of which were first made known\r\nin detail by M. Naville ; in it the limbs of the deceased are described in highly poetical language, and\r\nthe comparisons at times resemble the descriptions of\r\nthe limbs of the beloved one in the Song of Solomon . Four Chapters, CLXII, CLXIII, CLXIV, and\r\nCLXV, have no equivalents in the Recensions of the\r\nBook of the Dead older than the twenty-sixth dynasty, and as they contain foreign words and foreign\r\nideas they are probably the work of non-Egyptian\r\nauthors ; each of them is followed by a long Rubric\r\nwhich orders certain curious amulets to be made and\r\nthe performance of ceremonies . In Chapters CLXXIV,\r\nCLXXVII, and CLXXVIII we have extracts from the\r\nold Heliopolitan Recension of the Book of the Dead\r\nwhich was in use in the fifth and sixth dynasties, and\r\nthe comparison of the texts, which, thanks to M . Maspero, we are now able to make, is very instructive .\r\nWe can see how misunderstandings of the meaning\r\nof certain passages arose through the want of adequate determinatives, and we can note how later copyists modified and adapted old texts to suit modern\r\nviews. Thus in the passage from the text of Un is\r\n(1 . 166 ff., see is fra, p. 329 we have a reference to\r\nC LXXXI I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\nthe love-making ` of the deceased which is entirely\r\nomitted from the later copy of it given in the Papyrus of Nebseni ; and it seems as if the ideas expressed in it found no favour with the cultured mind of\r\nNebseni, the great designer, draughtsman, and artist, who was attached to the Temple of Ptah at\r\nMemphis . In a similar manner it will be noticed that\r\nmost of the coarse expressions and ideas which are\r\nfound in the religious books of the old period have\r\nno counterparts in the Theban Recension of the Book\r\nof the Dead .\r\nIt will be seen from the above brief summary that,\r\nalthough the contents of the papyri containing the\r\nTheban Recension are miscellaneous, there are references to other works connected with the burial of\r\nthe dead from which no extracts are given . Among\r\nsuch may be specially mentioned the texts which are\r\nconnected with the performance of the ceremony of\r\n\"Opening the mouth\" (see i)fra, p. 70), but as it is\r\nimpossible to give any adequate description of them\r\nin the space now left to me, I refer the reader to\r\nmy Papyrus of Ail*, p . 265 ff.\r\ni . M. Maspero's rendering of the passage (see Les Inscriptions des\r\nPyranides de Saggarah, p . zi) runs :- \"0 Ra, sois bon pour lui en ce\r\njour des hier ; car Ounas a connu la deesse Maouit, Ounas a respire la\r\nflamme d'Isi .

This pillar rests upon the\r\nhorizon . On each side of it are three apes typical of the Spirits\r\nof the Dawn, adoring the disk ; on the right is the goddess\r\nNephthys and on the left is the goddess Isis, Nephthys kneels\r\nupon the symbol of the sunset, and Isis upon the symbol of the\r\ndawn. Above the whole scene is the vaulted sky . In the Papyrus\r\nof Hu-nefer the pillar is endowed with human arms and hands,\r\nwhich grasp the crook and flail, emblematic of Osiris' reign and\r\nrule, and the two goddesses are standing upright ; one says\r\n\"I am thy sister Nephthys\", and the other : \"I am thy sister\r\nIsis, the divine mother.\" The sun is typified by a hawk having\r\na disk, encircled by an uraeus, upon his head . The apes are\r\nhere seven in number, four stand in front and three behind ;\r\nabove the whole scene is the vaulted sky .\r\nCertain papyri have also vignettes which illustrate the hymns to\r\nthe setting sun . 2 In this case the hawk usually stands upon the\r\nemblem of the West while apes and gods adore him . In the\r\nPapyrus of Qenna on the right three hawk-headed gods kneel\r\nin adoration with their left arms raised, and on the left three\r\njackal-headed gods, with their right arms raised in adoration .\r\nBelow, two lion-headed gods, with disks on their heads, are seated\r\nback to back in a cluster of lotus flowers ; these typify dawn\r\nand eventide .
